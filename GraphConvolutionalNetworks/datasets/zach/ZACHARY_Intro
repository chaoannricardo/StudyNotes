ZACHARY KARATE CLUB

DATASET ZACHARY

DESCRIPTION Two 34Ã—34 matrices.

    ZACHE symmetric, binary.
    ZACHC symmetric, valued. 

BACKGROUND These are data collected from the members of a university karate club by Wayne Zachary. The ZACHE matrix represents the presence or absence of ties among the members of the club; the ZACHC matrix indicates the relative strength of the associations (number of situations in and outside the club in which interactions occurred).

Zachary (1977) used these data and an information flow model of network conflict resolution to explain the split-up of this group following disputes among the members.
