        <div style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">
            Still, I'm a total amateur when it comes to global-traveling.
        </div>
        <br><br>
        The time I finally started constructing the website, the countries I’ve been are China, Japan, Vietnam, U.S.A.,
        Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Belgium, France, and Spain.
        <br><br>
        And I think it might be a good start to document my stories within my past journeys, as long as those memories.
        <br><br>
        Within the website, I plan to mainly focusing on my journey in the past, as well as the ones I start in the
        future. However, other topics, information technology, for instance, may also come up to your eyes. (Since I’m
        now learning & training myself with the skills of data science, that’s highly possible.)
        <br><br>
        Also do I get myself a Instagram account, with the photos I’ve shot within the travels. Everyone is welcome of
        viewing the account, however; during the time I type down the article, the composition within the account are
        mainly based on Mandarin Chinese.
        <br><br><br><br>
        <div style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">
            And here’s a little bit introduction of myself,
        </div>
        <br><br>
        I’m Ricardo, Ricardo S. Chao, while my mandarin name comes up with Chao, Shang-Han. Born in Taipei, Taiwan. I’m
        still now spending most of my time studying in my home country, and hopefully, after acquiring my master degree
        (I’m now still a master candidate), I could work aboard and travel a lot during the work-time.
        <br><br>
        I love travel. Within the time I’m still acquiring my bachelor degree, I travel aboard 3-4 times a year, and
        had skipped lots of my classes. (hehe) During the time, I’ve been to Vietnam, New York, China, and Japan.
        Especially Japan, within the 13 times my travels within the period, I’ve been to the country about 7-8 times,
        and making me (kind of) experienced traveler within the region.
        <br><br>
        And also China, since the little difference within the language and culture between mainland China and Taiwan, it makes me easy to travel
        around the region without facing any kind of communicating obstacle.
        <br><br>
        Well, I think it’s better to stop here before the article begin to grow larger and larger.
        <br><br>
        As a conclusion, I would like share my passion to travel as long as any other story I’m facing within my daily
        life.
        <br><br>
        And just in case you would like to further contact me,
        <br><br>
        my e-mail is <a href="mailto:richiechao95!gmail.com">richiechao95@gmail.com</a>, please fell comfortable to
        mail me regarding any possible issue, thanks.
