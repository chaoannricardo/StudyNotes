   A partitioned view joins horizontally partitioned data from a set of member tables across one or more servers, making the data appear as if from one table. Microsoft SQL Server distinguishes between local and distributed partitioned views. In a local partitioned view, all participating tables and the view reside on the same instance of SQL Server. In a distributed partitioned view, at least one of the participating tables resides on a different (remote) server. In addition, SQL Server differentiates between partitioned views that are updatable and views that are read-only copies of the underlying tables
