1,"I like superhero flicks. Being honest though, there is a certain 'sameness' to most of them. Avengers: Endgame could be called the granddaddy of all superhero movies, I suppose. At just a touch over 3 hours long, it is certainly far longer than most. It probably features more superheroes than most too. At one point, I think every Marvel superhero that ever existed was on screen - (except, curiously, the X-Men). Yes, a lot of time, effort, creativity and money - lots of money - went into this. Sadly, it left me feeling kind of flat. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but I didn't love it. In fact, I didn't feel anything when it was over - no sadness at the losses incurred, no exhilaration at the victories. Nothing. I never found myself on the edge of my seat once. This may have been Marvel's great battle-of-our-time movie, but it was no Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (now THAT was a movie that pulled you in!). So, I guess we're left asking where to now Marvel? Do we care? I know I'll keep watching what you put out, but the lustre is starting to wear thin."
2,"Convenient how they had managed to come up with a time portal disregarding the fact that one of the infinity stones had done just that. This movie is overrated, and pretty much not worth the trip to the theatre."
3,"The most complete hero movie I ever seen. Full of emotions and loves. Make hero seem vulnerable and as human as us. And yet make the sacrifice as the last resort Good job marvel , the thing is we will be expecting a higher ceiling next time and I think it's difficult to raise. A really emotional journey for me has ended."
4,"Funny, emotional, surprising, and worth the wait. The 3 hours flew by, and i enjoyed every minute of it. More nostalgic than i was expecting, but great nonetheless."
5,"What an absolute emotional rollercoaster! There was never a dull moment and it was a 3 hour movie! Every character played their part and it came together beautifully! The fight scenes and graphics were incredible! What a great way to end it really.[換行字元][換行字元]The only little things that irritated me was that I was hoping the 'full' Hulk came to play as he is a lot more powerful than they portray him in the Marvel movies. Also... Captain Marvel comes across very arrogant and smug like 'yes we know... you are super powerful and you know it'. I know Iron Man is very arrogant as well but he makes it into a positive as its funny and likeable![換行字元][換行字元]Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and for all of you that haven't seen it yet... get the tissues ready!"
6,Just prepare to be wowed. My First 10 star rating for Endgame!!
7,One should just stop at Avengers Infinity War and not watch this stupid movie. One of the worst movies of this series.
8,"Good movie, but the forced ""girl power"" fight scene at the end lowered this a whole star for me. Disney needs to drop the feminazi SJW bs and just focus on making movies."
9,I love how the directors overtly manage to embed and portray potentially cringe moments in the comics on screen!!
10,"It was a great summary and ""ending"" of the avengers storyline."
11,Actually marvel did a good job with this movie Like actors and directors and visual parts It deserves a high rating
12,"All has been said, fanboys stop overrating your S***"
13,"I had to think on my rating and review quite carefully for this film, as the final part of the movie elevates it from the rest of it.[換行字元][換行字元]If I had to summarize this movie in one word it would be ""convoluted"". They take a sci-fi trope that always causes problems due to logic issues and went full steam ahead with it. The first two hours of the movie were quite unexpected, and by that I mean underwhelming, for the final movie in a decade long storyline.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie comes into its own and gives the fanbase geekgasms about 20 minutes to the end, but it wasn't enough in my opinion. I have rated it a 7 as I truly enjoyed the way it concluded.[換行字元][換行字元]There were a couple of scenes that made me laugh, but if as I wrote earlier, the final 20 - 30 minutes of Endgame are better than the previous 2 and a half hours of it, as there are too many flaws in logic and even the directors and screenwriters are not on the same page in their interviews as to how things are supposed to work.[換行字元][換行字元]I won't bother with a suggestion of should you go see it or not, but unless you are truly blinded by love for the franchise, don't expect a masterpiece or the best film from Marvel so far."
14,"Amazing,simply awesome and a wow movie! A perfect treat for marvel fans and as the title suggest.... what an endgame! A very perfect combination of all mcu superheroes and hard-working of thousands of people. It emphasises emotion as much as action and a lovely comic timing which makes audience not to miss a second of scene! The best ever movie of mcu!with the perfect #Endgame"
15,"Endgame is the pinnacle of what is possible for the comic book genre, the 10 year infinity saga comes to a emotionally satisfying end. And is easily one of the greatest films of all time, it's an experience you will never forget and a film that will never be forgotten."
16,"Being one of the best marvel movies does not means that this is one of the best movies of all time, not even the best superheroe film[換行字元][換行字元]Sorry fanboys but is the truth"
17,No words to describe this masterpiece. Not to many movies can give you all those different emotions....from beginning to end. I will go again.
18,The best Sci Fi movie out there and it's amazingly emotional. Well done!!
19,"Too long, too boring, too many special effects versus substance. Bad jokes Don't don't waste your money or time."
20,Only DC fans or grandpas criticize this movie. This is by far the best Comicbook movie ever been released.[換行字元][換行字元]I personally liked it more than Dark night franchise.
21,"Horrible movie. Boring and poorly written. I don't understand the high rating or the hype. I didn't even finish watching it because it was so awful. I love all of the Marvel movies, but this one was unwatchable. What a waste of a perfectly good Saturday night."
22,I was not impressed. Save your money and time. Wait till they show this in Netflix John Wick 3 should have been in this film and story line could have been way better!
23,"Overall a good movie, felt like Infinity War and two previous Avenger movies were better, not as rushed. There were many holes in the internal story for Endgame, could have been pushed out to two 2-hour movies to help fill in some questions.[換行字元][換行字元]In general I was pleased but without giving away spoilers and movie details it's a movie to check out for all fans and want a good 3-hr experience at the theatre."
24,"Endgame is far from perfect, and it takes a long time to properly get going, but once it realises exactly what it wants to be, it's the perfect climax to a decade of build-up and packs a surprisingly emotional punch.[換行字元][換行字元]However, fortnite is in this movie, so I'm giving it a 0/10"
25,Im still in such a shock and I think I experience so many emotions I felt like I was electrified to that screen in the same time I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and all this 3 hours TAS like a 30 minutes.[換行字元][換行字元]I don't think we ever seen more epic superhero movie.[換行字元][換行字元]I don't intend to spoil the movie and all I'm just going to say I don't think that one watching will be enough to understand what is going on in this morning so I'm planning to go back and then I'm going to make proper spoiler review it's Saturday[換行字元][換行字元]I'm so glad that I am witnessing this majestic movie!

27,"Dabby Dobbo have a taco.[換行字元][換行字元]Go for hulk, Steve who? *Playstation Shrek face*"
28,"It is a perfect movie because it has action, adventure, fantasy, suspence their is no movie which can defeat avengers endgame i love this movie 1,46,00,005 times"
29,"This is not bad ending nor good ending, this is great ending"
30,"After watching the movie, I'm actually glad it's all over. A massive build up and so many MCU die-hard fans oversold it. Don't get me wrong, I liked the Marvel movies in general. But after SOOOOOOOO many of them I'm over it - and this movie didn't really help that. There was nothing new here: the same cliched lines, the same tears and long stares and fancy speeches, the same rivalries started and finished and referred to with a gentle (yet sickening) smile... You get the idea. It was good, but in a boring, ""I've seen this before"" kind of way. I truly hope this is the end of these massive big production movies for a while."
31,"I don't know how they were able to keep things so cohesive. This is, arguably, part 22 of the longest story telling in the history of film. It so good and so intricate. There isn't a moment where you are bored but to understand all that's going on, at a minimum, you should watch Infinity Wars, Captain Marvel first... but to enjoy the full maximum benefit you really should watch all the Marvel films.[換行字元][換行字元]I'm going to keep this spoiler free because I hate spoilers and besides...no one should be reading any reviews if you are planning on seeing this. You already know what's the deal now and you are either invested or you're not.[換行字元][換行字元]Let me just say that the CGI is just gorgeous. This is a pretty thing to watch. Bradley Cooper'S Rocket is just a brilliant piece of voice acting. Chris Evans is the ultimate hero. Not the strongest or smartest but he totally sells you on being the truest.[換行字元][換行字元]This film is pretty emotional at points... in unexpected places for me. And it is a must see on the big screen.[換行字元][換行字元]I just realize I didn't really review the film in the typical sort of review but I can say that there are moments in the film where the audience cheered and you didn't mind. This is the Super Bowl of super hero films. I like the way they wrapped it up. And i bet it receives a Best Picture nod. It will not win but it will be nominated. It definitely will clean up in all the technical categories.[換行字元][換行字元]God, I'm going to miss all of this. Going to see a Marvel movie or two, every year... i can't wait to own it so I can host a marathon. Please enjoy this with your friends and family.. because in the end that's what it's all about and this film drives home that point."
32,"I managed to attend a double bill of this and Infinity War last night with Endgame being the midnight movie. Going to a midnight showing takes alot of effort as you are disrupting your working week to watch a movie until 3 am, but it seems to be the only way to avoid having the movie spoiled. Was it worth the upheaval? In short yes. This definitely delivers as the franchise closer. This is a very dark movie at the beginning and while their is alot going on story wise (there are alot of character story arcs to deal with) it feels like a resolution to the overall narrative. This could be problematic for some people who haven't seen every movie in the franchise as stories are resolved from characters origins movies. As is the standard with this franchise the action scenes and effects are so well done that watching other superhero movies can pale in comparison. The blending of the different character universes is seamless and the fun is watching the interactions of the characters. All action, twists, humour and emotion which you have come to expect in these movies is here. If you have managed to resist looking for spoilers online then see it as soon as possible, because people will want to discuss this movie. If you are the type of actively went looking for them then you may have ruined the movie for yourself as one of the numerous rumoured plot lines is real. You only have yourself to blame. Endgame doesn't have the same heavyweight emotional punch that Infinity War does but they were never going to top THAT ending. Although there were men crying in the screening I attended and tried to pretend they weren't. This appears to be a definite ending to this particular story arc as there is NO post credit scene, so you are know equipped with the knowledge to beat the crowds at the end. No spoilers and a handy tip? You don't get that from every IMDB reviewer!"
33,"I can understand the feeling of MCU fans but the movie didn't have the impact, as IW. I didn't expect IW to be a good movie, so I had high hopes from Endgame, but it didn't turn out to be that great. Acting was spot on, but felt draggy in between with jokes here and there. War sequence was rushed, there wasn't any wow factor in during that scene. Ending was fine. Ye fans would love it."
34,No post credit seen. Thats why i rate only 9. Rest is amazing. I love the way of writing of film.
35,"Good one but boring in middle. Overall movie , it's theme isn't too bad"
36,Total comicbook movie. In every way! Every character gets to shine and every character gets an ending to their story.
37,"Definitive ending to the characters and full packed joyride to the thrilling end , BTW the last 45 minutes are better than any film"
38,"This is not a long review but i think Avengers Endgame was very good film even though i had high hopes. I loved infinity war so i thought maybe this one was gonna be a bit of a disappointment, but no it was even better. The acting was great as well the CGI. The first two hours were fun to watch but the last hour was amazing, I had goosebumps all the time."
39,"Going into this movie, we all knew it was Chris Evans and RDJ's last Marvel movie. In my opinion, these two guys defined the MCU and helped make it what it is today. The real question became how they were going to exit the MCU and let me just say that Endgame delivered and was the perfect last movie for them.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame wrapped up 11 years of jaw-dropping movies into one 3-hour cinematic masterpiece. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.[換行字元][換行字元]When you go into this movie, just remind yourself of where this journey started. This may be the last movie for Evans and RDJ but it's a whole new beginning for our new heroes.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you, Marvel and every actor and actress who made this movie the best one yet"
40,"I can't even describe how good Avengers Endgame is without spoiling it, which I won't. It wraps up a 11 year saga of 22 movies perfectly. Call backs to (almost) every movie. I laughed, I cheered and cried. Someone actually spoiled the end for me and it was still such a enjoyable movie. The Russo brothers understand that story is more important that cool VFX and one liners. It has drama, suspense and amazing action. I will say this though. You need to see every movie in order to enjoy it completely. And remember #dontspoiltheendgame"
41,"Avengers Endgame is the conclusion to 11 years worth of MCU build up. A 3 hour long epic superhero adventure packed with eye candy action and emotional moments that suffers from a few minor inconsistencies in story and characters. The promotional material has been incredibly vague and therefore I'll keep it too with this review too to not ruin the fun. After the 'events' of Infinity War, the Avengers are forced to reassemble and take on Thanos (Josh Brolin) once more. That's all I'll say about the plot. I was genuinely surprised with the direction that was taken for many characters. Unlike Infinity War, the heroes are in front center this time. There were genuine arcs that made me love and feel for these characters yet again and all of the actors were fantastic. Robert Downey jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Chris Hemsworth are at the centre of this movie and there characters were all the best, emotional and surprising for me. Especially Ruffalo lightened up the mood with a comedic performance. At this point the chemistry and comradeship between the Avengers is undeniably the best part of these films. Just seeing these characters on screen talking and interacting was truly amazing. The conversations and relationships they share with each other is vital to the films success and it absolutely delivers. The humour is on point, the dialogue snappy and real and the fight just as brutal and significant as before. All other actors too gave very effective performance but I will admit that there were two that disappointed me a little. Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) and surprisingly Josh Brolin (Thanos). I haven't seen Captain Marvel but the use of her character in Endgame didn't do much for me. She had no personality and Larson (a terrific actress) didn't have the inviting charisma that a Scarlett Johansson has. Whilst he stole the show in Infinity War, Brolin's Thanos is merely reduced to a big evil villain in this film. I get that most of the screen time and story was dedicated to the Avengers and that Infinity War was Thanos' movie. But if I'm supposed to judge Endgame as a film on its own, his character definitely felt underused. Some jumbled story parts that best shouldn't be overly analysed aside. Avengers Endgame is an absolutely experience from start to finish. Perhaps the best film in the MCU yet I don't know how they can possibly top this. Wrapped up with a nice bow and tie, Endgame is a satisfying blockbuster for all fans of the MCU and superhero films in general."
42,"NÃO HA ADJETIVO SUFICIENTE PARA ILUSTRAR AS EMOÇÕES QUE ESTE FILME PROPORCIONA. É IMPECAVEL, SENSACIONAL, PRIMOROSO... PQP, QUE FILMAO DA PORRA![換行字元][換行字元]ANTES DE ASSISTI-LO, COLOQUE SUAS EXPECTATIVAS NAS NUVENS, APÓS ASSISTI-LO VERÁ QUE SUAS EXPECTATIVAS FORAM JOGADAS AO ESPAÇO"
43,Marvell had a challenge to finish a great 11-year stage and 22 films that had a great viewing experience may have some small mistakes. I expected more than some characters. But I'm happy at this end I do not expect it could have been better deserves 10/10 because it was a big challenge and has won the challenge It should not be compared with less effortless films Do not direct this great challenge and should not be compared with the infinity war because this film is a complement to the film The Infinite War
44,"Go see the movie if you enjoy the MCU movies. It ties up a lot of loose ends and has a relatively satisfying ending.[換行字元][換行字元]Infinity War was an extremely tough act to follow, and sadly these writers could not end it very well. The movie is simply too long. Don't try to put what happens in the movie in context and you will enjoy it.[換行字元][換行字元]If you try to think things through and consider what is going on in the movie, you will never be surprised about anything that happens. All the typical Hollywood writer cues are there if you pay attention.[換行字元][換行字元]The writers also did the typical thing and borrowed ideas from other sci-fi movies. Remember when Spider-Man in Civil War used his web shooters a la Empire Strikes Back? Or when he killed Thanos goon in Infinity War by invoking Aliens? This movie constantly does that as if Peter Parker was helping write the script.[換行字元][換行字元]Also very disappointed with the Captain Marvel treatment. More of the same from her movie. She is super powerful yet seems so limited in her imagination of how to use her powers.[換行字元][換行字元]No spoilers. RDJ was great, as was Hemsworth. Renner did his best, but he is definitely more of an action star. Evans got top billing in this movie and did pretty good. Larson was deadpan as she was in Captain Marvel. Ruffalo stole the show."
45,Reasonably slow build up was required to properly explain the whole time travel build up and in the end was absolutely worth the wait as the fight scenes were absolutely immense and brings the 11 year journey of the Avengers to a scintillating and awfully emotional end.
46,Endgame is everything I expected and more than I expected and ties all the previous 21 Marvel films together it was just fantastic
47,"This movie is so full of cliches, it is so unoriginal and filled with stale humour that you just shouldn't do something as bad as watching this to yourself."
48,"Avengers Infinity Was by far one of the best of these types of movies but unfortunately the conclusion missed the mark by a long shot. It was slow, boring and the dialogue except for a few funny moments was just plain flat. Captain Marvel s appearance was just out of place and added nothing. We all knew what the story was going to be but to throw this at the audience was just plain lazy. ."
49,I was a bit excited for this title given that I really like the previous one but I ended up a bit disappointed... It's often very versatile from one Marvel to another. I found the characters' decision not really making sense in many occasions and the plot ended up not making that much sense anymore I found.
50,"MARVEL movies are action flicks predominantly, this one took the gamble of character development and bringing in raw emotions in much of the movie, while the fight scene towards the end was choreographed brilliantly, somehow the movie didn't work on the drama level, and time travel concepts are always a risky bet, and somehow in the end, it did not come of as well, at the end of the day. Avengers End Game is a fitting tribute to all the major characters, but it certainly did not live up the expectation that was delivered in its previous installment."
51,The Russo brothers did a bang up job wrapping up the entirety of what has become the MCU so far. The action scenes are very well done. The humor is admittedly hit-or-miss. But the acting from the all star cast (and there's a gigantic cast here) is very good. It includes some of the best character work in the MCU series in years. The final battle scene (shut up that's not a spoiler) is fan service galore. I think the concluding moments will be quite satisfying to many comics movie fans.
52,"I really like every single part of the movie, at any time i was watching the movie i was in shock every second in that movie is to die for, really a masterpiece"
53,Nice Movie.Brilliant direction and vfx.A fitting end to the franchise
54,Good movie nice actours very nice comics story.... Go watch
55,"I've just returned from watching Avengers: Endgame on opening night. As a fan of Marvel for over three decades I had many expectations and thoughts about what this movie might bring, and this movie was nothing that I expected. It brought us both the best (and worst in my opinion) versions of Earth's mightiest heroes. And I'm sure that many out there will disagree with me on which is which. What is undeniable is that the Russo's have managed to achieve what many (including myself) thought impossible, to deliver a film which pays tribute to the past decade's 21 (not including Endgame itself) Marvel Cinematic Universe offerings, whilst simultaneously closing out the story lines and creating an epic masterpiece in itself. It has humour (some of good), action, emotion and genuinely something for everyone all rolled up into an epic three hours of entertainment, which goes by in a flash. Well done, fantastic work.[換行字元][換行字元]Thanos, it's Hammertime!"
56,"The film was ok, but i don't see Marvel in it. I see frustrations, unanswered questions, heroes ""unavailable"" and heroes ""unused"". I enjoyed it, but i went in with too many expectations. And in the end i can only say: ""Plot holes ftw"""

59,"Endgame is One of the finest avengers installment in marvel universe. Full pack of thrill, surprises , happiness, laughter and sorrows. Going for a second show 😉"
60,"Best way to describe a three hour venture without recklessly diving into spoiler territory. The movie excels best at its central element of time travel, which is rather where the momentum is truly its natural best. The characters are all rounded, perhaps more so here than Infinity War. This is likely a fair take on what results now as a quadrilogy than a trilogy. When the action really gets to its peak level, it's almost effortless with the buildup doing every bit of the talking. The most curious turnout is the studio's first ever movie to be well over three hours, which to be frank could have succeeded with more than the overall result in this movie. Just a thought at hand, rest assured the pacing eventually comes to a fitting close that won't underwhelm the overall theme of what's termed the Infinity Saga. The emotion and depth really get to how things play out, also a bit improvised over Infinity War and in the viably greater ways. Got to lose a point for how it uses fan service done right as a sendoff to breeze through the buildup process up to the key parts that make this movie the ultimate conclusion it will be for a long time. My favorite of the Russo brothers' directed movies remains Civil War, simply because it was a Captain America movie of all the flicks back then that really pushed hard to reach a well deserved billion mark. This might get there a little too easily. Duh, but noteworthy. Give or take eleven years and twenty two movies, which as I mention is twice its bargain. Facing Thanos the second time really says something, which is likely all to consider about it."
61,"This will be a 10 for any fan, when I say fan mean all the people that have seen any avenger hero movie.[換行字元][換行字元]This is a very well executed conclusion in a series of movies.

62,Im not gonna spoil this. Full of emotions out there... sacrifice... love ... and action..❤
63,"The wait, The exitment, The enthusiasm for the movie End Game all get the value from the makers, First of all a big Thank you to marvels & Rossue brothers, who has given us such a materpiece, hven't seen the movie so big & marvelous..!!

64,"I'm not going to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it, but it was one of the best (in my opinion) marvel movies. You can tell that the cast and crew of Avengers Endgame put all their heart and soul into the making of this movie, and that's what made it a great movie!"
65,It seems arbitrary to review a movie like this. It's not a movie it's a journey. I watched MCU movies over 5 years before this and it is a great conclusion. I can't say you'll love it and it's easy to nitpick but its good. Seeing it in the theater was an experience I will never get again. Sincerely recommended.
66,"Just saw it for the second time. Actually worse than I remember. Still a bit frustrated over how ""Hulk-situation"" turned out, as in no endgame fight with Thanos :-/ Too many jokes. It's not a comedy. Too long. Too much 'girl power'....and yeaahhh I know we live in that time were girls has to be as good as men, and were Superman and the little mermaid has to be black...but still!![換行字元][換行字元]Anyway. I downgraded my rating. The movie doesn't deserve a higher overall rating than 7/10"
67,"Absolutely FANTASTIC movie!! Very worthy end to a long cinematic history. Not often a movie gets this emotional, funny, exciting and heroic all rolled into one very refined roll. The Russo brothers have done it! Absolutely blown away! From being corny now and then to an emotional rollercoaster right after that. A masterpiece!"
68,Worst Marvel Movie. Poetic justice with a absurd plot and messy storyline.
69,Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date
70,Its different now without Iron Man. MCU have to make something new. its not just the graphics but the story.
71,No better way to wrap up a legacy... This movie is truely flawless
72,"Avengers:Endgame,wasted all Avengers Series. Very Poor story, pathetic twists, lots of ridiculous jokes and minimum action. Hulk character is wasted Arrogant Captain Marvel. Waste of money I dont recommend to see in Cinemas"
73,"It made me laugh, it made me cry. Will remember endgame forever!"
74,"I was thinking how marvel could make a greater and more spectacular ending after they created infinity war. And yet, they make it right and spot on. Good job"
75,"The anticipation and the build up to the beginning credits are a testament to the careful building of this timeline. The Russo brothers prove yet again why they were the only ones up to this task as I don't think any other directors out there could've done such a careful job weaving all these characters into one movie. While the movie is a bit long not a minute feels wasted, no joke feels uncalled for, and not one character seems unnecessary. So many moments made me feel like a kid again. Some making me jump in my seat in excitement to things I never thought I'd see on film. I hope everyone gets a chance to see it without having a thing spoiled for them as every scene truly feels special."
76,"Avengers: Endgame is an incredibly epic conclusion to the infinity saga. The direction by Joe and Anthony Russo is amazing once again. All the performances are great, especially Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans. The visual effects are incredible. It's surprisingly funny, emotional and well paced with incredible action. Also the third act is truly incredible and the score by Alan Silvestri is his best Avengers score by far."
77,I loved all the other movies..but I'm not sure I can even finish watching this...3hours of not getting to the damn point already...
78,There is only one problem with this movie. It ended😭😭. How could you write and built this amazing movie. Made in American😎😎🤗🤗
79,The movie was ok. Not good. Not bad. Just ok. All the fanboys out there giving this an average rating of 9.1 haven't seen a 9/10 movie ever or simply vote this up this high because they haven't been cuddled enough as a kid or something.[換行字元][換行字元]The story was what bugged me the most. It wasn't exciting at all. Never once did I think ok this is a bad moment to go to the toilet or something. It really was that dull.[換行字元][換行字元]This is like the new star wars movies. Made for children who don't care about the plot and just want to see action and by now boring jokes.
80,"1st hour too slow, 2nd hour good,3rd great. A lot of hand-wringing and soul searching,a good 45 minutes to an hour that is unnecessary. About the 2nd hour it gets interesting and at the end is a great battle scene involving almost everyone. There are 2 nice send offs at the end that go through all the major characters from the last 21 movies. They seem to not have heard all the Hawkeye jokes in the past few years because he's in half the movie. And with all the recent Captain Marvel hype she's barely in it. Thor has some character development that I really enjoyed but fans are crying all over the internet about it. All in all once it gets going it's a good end to the cycle but could have used a good editor."
81,"Nothing really happening ....Captain Marvel is in it for a bit...Black Panther was in it too, not sure why[換行字元][換行字元]Dramatic scenes purely over the top....just seems like they tried to fit all 5000 Avengers into this film and actually forgot about the film[換行字元][換行字元]3 hours, I'll never get back .......one good battle scene tho"
82,"Just came out of the cinema and the first word coming to my mind is 'EPIC'. This movie concluded the past 11 years in the best possible way or even better because a movie like this seemed to be impossible. The great battle scene is the very best in cinematic history, to be honest it is almost as good as an orgasm. I am happy that I could witness it - what is more on the premiere day. This masterpiece made me prouder than ever to be an MCU fan! Well done! Pretty sure I will pay to see it again... and again... :)"
83,"No Spoilers This movie epitomises why I no longer pay to go to the cinema. It must be a free ticket and I must be bored. Those are my two criteria. It is therefore quite ironic that this film is boring. Was I not clear in my criteria. I said ""I must be bored"". NOT I want to see a BORING film! I quite enjoyed Infinity Wars to some extent but this film was just plain stupid. It must have been written by the children of the directors. It's that bad. I tried to tolerate this film as much as possible, started falling asleep then pinched myself and thought, ""what tf am I doing here?"" and walked out!"
84,Could think of a better way to close this amazing saga.
85,"It's fair to say that this movie had alot to live up to. After the mind - blowing events of Avengers: Infinity War, all eyes were on the Russo brothers to create a fitting conclusion to the infinity saga with Endgame. It has not disappointed. This really is the ultimate MCU film.This film is stunningly crafted in a way as to give us a nostalgic look at the MCU's best moments. It balances comedy and sincerity perfectly and has some of the the most gut wrenching emotional scenes whilst also being often absolutely hilarious. All of the avengers endeavors lead them to one of the most stunning and satisfying showdowns in film history. This Movie ties up all the loose ends and has a bold and brilliant ending. It truly is a masterpiece and will become a classic in the future."
86,It's was one of my best Experiences ever. It's a memory that I will share with my childrens & Grandchildrens
87,"It's funny, it's sad, its serious, it's crazy. The ending is mental.🤓 The plot is nuts.😋 4 years ago, I remember how surprised I was that Ironman, got such a great movie.🙂 I never dreamed that 21 films later, I'd be bawling in the theater, watching it all come to an end.😔 A culmination of 10 years and 21 movies deserves a finish like this.👏 I will never ever get over that ending.✊ When Iron Man's heartbeat stopped, I felt someone ripped out my heart. 💔 11 years, 21 movies, all leading to #AvengersEndgame 😎"
88,"Will make you laugh, will make you cry, will make you jump out of your seat[換行字元][換行字元]The sad thing is that it's s the MCU finale"
89,"Every time I get drawn into a discussion on a comicbook adaptation I will invariably utter the phrase ""Well, in the books...""[換行字元][換行字元]I'm an old fan of the genre, having read many of the books that are being adapted now as a child. I get very nit-picky when a film strays too far from its source material. The MCU broke me of that. Gradually over the years I accepted new ideas, if introduced in a good way. The details can be mailable, so long as a core theme is adhered to.[換行字元][換行字元]I walked into Endgame today having no idea what could happen, and no preconceptions about what should happen. The previous 21 (wow) movies all took their source materials in different ways, for better or worse. In the end the source gets a nod, but the characters remain faithful, which was the case here.[換行字元][換行字元]Nothing of the sequence of events could have been predicted by me, a man whose read the original Infinity Stones series, and that was for the best. If I knew what was going to happen, it wouldn't have made for an enjoyable experience.[換行字元][換行字元]What I watched was a denouement of an impressive 11 year, 22 film series, the likes of which happening again are extremely remote. I was filled with so much emotion by the end, alternating from cheering to sniffling, I walked out knowing only that I'll be going to see it once more while it is in theater just so I can properly digest what I saw.[換行字元][換行字元]If you are watching this movie never having seen the previous films (meaning you've been living under a rock for a decade) you won't understand a thing that happens. But as a closing to a series, you could not have expected a better experience.[換行字元][換行字元]'Nuff said."
90,"From a fans' perspective, this has a lot of rewatchability value, but the plot holes bring down the whole franchise retrospectively. The directors took some creative choices that, for the most part, paid out, but watching this movie after the others in this franchise is a let down. Some heroes act out of character and although I felt the tension in the first couple of acts, the third one really didn't do nothing for me. Infinity War was better constructed, but this had more heart."
91,"Overrated and slow as hell. I was yawning whole time during first-half, second half was little better. Don't know the taste of people nowadays creating so much hype for an average movie. I found Alita way better in all aspect action, story, vfx still it is underrated. Eagerly waiting for Alita's sequal soon."
92,"I probably cried for at least the last hour of this film, literally. This film starts off VERY quick, throws you in right at the deep end. The next hour or so slows down quite a lot, not that it's a bad thing. It's a lot of character and world building. You also get the stuff where they do what they've got to do which kind of toom me out of it, I was like, is this how they're gonna do it? I thought there would be more to it? And then that last hour/hour and a half, it all comes together. It makes this film utterly perfect. I could have never possibly begin to dream up what had happened. The most epic battle you will ever see. This is a very minor spoiler: Captain Marvel gets a haircut and I hate it, it's weird and there's no need for it."
93,"This was nearly perfect. Trust me. It is the best film the MCU has to offer so far. As a fan of the franchise for nearly a decade (around two-thirds of my life, I am 12), it really left me satisfied with the conclusion of the stories I've been following for most of my life. I still remember my obsession with Iron Man 2 and Captain America: The First Avenger (primarily the latter) when they first came out when I was very young.[換行字元][換行字元]All the storylines I've been following for the better part of my entire life so far getting wrapped up (for the most part) really put a smile on my face. Infinity War was one of my favorite movies when it came out. I was mesmerized by the amount of material packed into those two and a half hours of runtime, but Endgame put all that to shame. The three hours of runtime gave the movie a lot of leeway with the plot, and it put all that to good use. It almost felt like two or three movies packed into one.[換行字元][換行字元]It does have a few flaws, however (although not severe enough to remove a star). A lot of different things were happening at once, leaving me somewhat discombobulated, although not too much. I won't dock any stars because of this, however, as the ending more than made up for it and some of my discombobulation may be accredited to the loud (yet admittedly fun) theater (as me and my friends were watching the first screening in the whole city).[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, I'd say this is a ten from me. You'd be doing yourself a favor if you watch this, even if you haven't watched any of the prior movies (even more so if you have watched even only just a few of them)."
94,"Avengers:Endgame is not only the best #mcu movie,but also an emotional wreck!It's an epic conclusion to the previous 21 films!Please go watch it if you haven't,it's a must watch and you won't be disappinted!So many unexpected things will happen in this movie and I'm surprised that the things I wish to appear in the movie did ended up happening!"
95,"If you've seen the Marvel movies, this is their Thank You to all the fans. They didn't care much for the logic or story. They just wanted everyone to feel happy.[換行字元][換行字元]And they did. I'm happy. Everyone in the cinema was clapping at the end credits."
96,"If I'm being totally honest, I didn't like the other movies. Captain America was irritating, the hulk movies were shocking, ant man was a comedy in fact other RDJ as iron man I was never impressed.[換行字元][換行字元]However, I binge watched the avengers movies, with one eye on the tv and one eye on my phone, last week knowing I was going to see end game in the cinema ..... and what a decision that was.[換行字元][換行字元]My biggest mistake for movies was never watching 'the matrix' when it came out. I am glad to say that this did not happen for 'End Game'. Superb, marvelous, incredible, outstanding are only a few superlatives I can give. Quite possibly the greatest ever 'wrap up' movie I've ever seen.[換行字元][換行字元]Fan or not, this is brilliant! 10/10."
97,Wonderful film I don't know how to describe❤Graphicand effects everything wow❤
98,"I believe many of those who are giving top scores to the movie are still feeding on the hype. Yes, it was extreme and yes I was more than excited to be a part of it as a MCU fan from the start. Saw the first screening in my country and booked tickets immediately after they were released for sale.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is not Infinity War part 2... It is different. The pace between drama, comedy and action moments isn't so well entwined in the timeline. Even the CGI isn't so good and the majority of the movie is too dark.[換行字元][換行字元]I keep having the feeling that the Russos wanted to make sure the movie strayed away from the most popular fan theories, and I would even suspect the reshoots at the end of last year were to edit some plot points that were too widely guessed.[換行字元][換行字元]The result, however, is the most incoherent MCU movie from them by far. Ever since Winter Soldier they have managed to build strong and emotional powerhouses, but as it stands Infinity War will be their peak, and not Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]I am sure every fan out there will watch the movie. Many will watch it more than once looking for all the easter eggs in it (there are such). But the reality is I left the cinema wondering if I saw the real movie. I keep having the feeling this was a troll release by the Russos, and a voice in my head keeps wondering if we will ever get to see the real release. I know there is no such thing, but I kind of wish there was."
99,"I'm honestly surprised at the amount of highly rated reviews, this feels like the standard superhero movie with a few little twists. The characters are standard and fine, with the exception of Captain Marvel, who is so perfect that she only fails when the plot tells her to and she has no stake or motivation in the story. The plot is slow, obvious, and kind-of bad honestly, but the action is good, especially the final action scene. It's a fine movie, I like it more than Avengers 2, Thor 1-2, etc. But it's not life changing in any way. Bonus points to Hawkeye for actually being a somewhat good character. 6.5/10"
100,Captain America switched with lokki at some point in past and captain never returned. This was more like a soap than action movie.
101,Absolutely loved it overall. The only thing I can say is that the there was so much going on that even in a long movie it felt rushed. Could easily add another hour. Great job overall I would just say that infinity war might be the best in the series but really....it was still awesome. I teared up in many scenes. It wasn't that it was sad...sometimes it was. But sometimes it felt so powerful it made me tear up
102,"All I got to say is Russo brothers, awesome just freaking awesome...."
103,"I feel like infinity war and endgame shouldn't be two but one single movie and that way it would have been more enjoying. Can't compare the two mock and tell which one was better but this was surely a great movie from the beginning to the end there were moments when i wanted to cry and there were moments when i wanted to stand and shout, so many jokes were there. A mix of so many emotions."
104,"I was really hoping to watch a good movie. I have seen all Marvel movies and was excited with the 10 star reviews. But this movie is basically garbage. A lot of characters doing random things. There was no interesting story line. The emotional scenes did not have any impact. The action scenes will leave you with a headache. What amazes me is people giving a 10 star, please be honest to yourself and rate correctly."
105,This is not a ratable or reviewable movie.. thanks to Marvel..iam speechless
106,"Not going to spoil anything. Simply put, Endgame beautifully closes all the stories of the first 11 years of Marvel's saga. The tributes really hit you in the feels, but at the same time they give a comforting sense of closure."
107,Its here the movie event of the year and what a way to end phase 3.
108,"You will enjoy this movie only if you have seen MCU movies like Thor, Captain America, Ironman, Guardians of galaxy, Antman etc. Otherwise it's just a good movie for any movie goer. But if you are true marvel fan then it's a treat to watch this epic end of a marvelous series of films."
109,This is the first time I've wrote a review because this film had it all. Sadness. Happiness. Anger. Every emotion under the sun. The battle of all battles. It was truly a love letter to all marvel fans. Just perfect.
110,"Well...after the depression one was left with after the Infinity War ended...This will make you clap your hand! Oops! I fear I might have mentioned too much! 3 hours it may be, but you will enjoy it. Make sure you go to the loo first before the movie start. Oh yes, if you are waiting for the credit scenes to roll...don't bother."
111,"I dont even wanna spend my time here writing how bad the movie and the story was, it was just soooooooooo awful"
112,"Uhhh so goood... I guess bigger is better and this is huge and I love it, the fights: great... Plot: great... Emotion:OOF (Would have been more emotional if it hadnt been spoiled... That isn't there fault tho) Comedy: great... Only issue the woman fight scene where literally all the women gather together and fight and we only see them, i agree women are important but i wanted to see everyone fight... Equally"
113,"I am a very great fan of Avengers. I did like the film, and watched all Avengers. What I didn't like in this film was the premise. It was very relatable to the other Avengers, but it didn't really make much sense, even if the plot and storyline was obvious. It was obvious, but the storyline was obsolete. Basically out of context and out of date.[換行字元][換行字元]Nonetheless, I really enjoyed watching, and the overall character animation. not worth watching twice, but definitely a film worth watching. A franchise worth watching."
114,Not just a superhero movie It pulls you in and makes you feel like your the superhero just amazing
115,The first part was much better. This one feels like a letdown!
116,This is hands down the best movie ever made. Same formula as Infinity War with emotions because they are everywhere. I felt it more for reasons I cannot spoil for anyone but I highly recommend this movie for everyone. Go watch it.
117,They open the story and characters very widely so closing the chapter was a mess. Too much drama (poor one) main characters was missing. They gave role of Thor to captain america and hulk as carton green man. Worst avengers and really it's an end game (just a game).
118,"This movie is a TRULY fitting end to phase 3 of the Marvel universe. My hat goes off to all of them for what they have made here. 100% satisfied.[換行字元][換行字元]Directing, acting, script, music, action, effects all 10/10. Pacing and a few of the timeline technicals get a mark down, but honestly do not impact the film enough for it to be considered anything less than absolutely stellar.[換行字元][換行字元]The emotional components of the film really truly carry much of what is taking place on the screen. I cried, about 5 times. Some occasions of which actually fully overwhelmed me. I can't name a film that has ever completely overwhelmed me emotionally before. Absolute credit to the acting and script writers for that one![換行字元][換行字元]If you have watched even a couple of the Marvel universe films, go see this film immediately."
119,"Avengers EndGame starts with the aftermaths of Infinity war(that spidy thing really left me emotional).The movie starts off well and after some time it becomes predictable,but comedy fills that void. There are some really hilarious scenes in the movie and you really gonna enjoy them . The entire 2hrs of the movie deals with the Time Heist thing, and the last 1hr is the much awaited combat between avengers and Thanos,the mad titan, which was quite clumsy and not that effective than Infinity war. And I didn't felt any emotion while watching the dying of our favourite avenger and I felt like the movie and the franchise should end in any way , so Russo brothers hurried in making that and it was so clumsy. The final battle VFX were not great for a movie like this. So , finally it ended . And I felt emotional not because of the movie ,but for I'm not going to see these avengers next time. Overall , EndGame is not a bad movie,nor a great. But it's a good movie with some good comedy and drama. (Infinity war stands first)"
120,"Avengers: Endgame is not a good movie. In fact, even when you like the Avengers, there are far better options to watch than this one, for example Infinity War. Endgame has lot of boring and cringy scenes, you really need to force yourself to watch it without skipping parts of it. Especially the fact that these ""Superheroes"" are still crying every day after Thanos snap and cant build up a life again was annoying af."
121,This film was so much fun & love how Thanos was finally defeated once & for all.
122,"A story that Russo brothers started 10 years back came to an end.The fictional characters made sure they remain with us till last breath. Goodbye hurts no matter how beautiful it is and ofcourse not watching AVENGERS ASSEMBLE in future will even hurt more.Thats how impactful it was, even if you haven't watched any marvel movie watch them watch them all and witness the magic of how a 180+ minute movie binds you with emotions,actions and of course never ending love towards our superheros. Kudos............."
123,Wtf are you doing? Thor and hulk were amazing they look dumb and you made them look stupid. What about this damn endig?!!! What was that? Its like im watching a low B movie!! What about the action? Do you call that a movie?!?!? Ive been waiting for this for years and now i lost interest in marvels!!!
124,"I'm in absolute awe at this film. Went above and beyond my expectations, which were incredibly high going in. This epic will make you laugh, cry and cheer! A must see, 15 out of 10!"
125,"Just watch and you will know this is a good film , MCU know how to play with your mood😂"
126,This movie didn't bring me to tears- it brought me to ugly crying sobs. For a 3 hour long movie I was surprised that I enjoyed every minute. It didn't drag. It was laid out very well and is overall Badass! Even satisfied and empowered women of all kinds! Sad to see this era end but excited to see what's in store for new generations.
127,"See it in IMAX! Or see it in the biggest, loudest auditorium your community has! It's ten times over worth the price of admission. Thank you Marvel for entertaining us for over a decade and respecting our emotional investment in these stories! Woot!"
128,As a fan of the marvel universe comic and cinematic. Tears of joy filled my eyes as the credits rolled then tears of sadness that it was all over. Endgame. Was. The. Perfect. Ending.
129,But I hearted much more for my favourite character Tony Stuck...
130,"After Infinity War there was one thought floating around my mind... how in the hell can they ever hope to top that? The answer? Avengers Endgame. For the bulk of the first act there's a sense of doom and dread, and there's a difficult balance the filmmakers the Russos and writers Stephen Mcfeely and Christopher Markus had to maintain: The balance between drama and appropriate doses of humor.[換行字元][換行字元]Not every superhero movie can accomplish that, but it seems like this being the fourth collaboration between the Russos and Mcfeely and Markus, they know the Avengers just as well as us, the audience do. There's several things that make this movie work so beautifully, first and foremost the writing. The Avengers interact better than ever, going from a team to sounding like best friends. They are united by their bond, by their loss and they all feel a moral and ethical duty to do everything and anything in their power to fix what Thanos did, last seen in Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]The other thing that makes this movie work so great is that there's a point to which the Avengers are at their lowest point... like they look like they are on the verge of absolute defeat... then suddenly... SUDDENLY... something happens and when it does it's the most amazing feeling in the world for us, the audience.[換行字元][換行字元]Markus/Mcfeely and the Russos know how to create great tension, which keeps you on the end of your seat and wondering... what's going to happen next?! You might think you know what's going to happen next, but the tension in this film is so great you find yourself wondering because how... how could the Avengers possibly win this time?! I've watched this movie at least 30 times now, and I think I can safely say this movie will never get old for me.[換行字元][換行字元]In the end, there's a lot of tears, a lot of smiles, and all around great feelings because after so many decades of being a DC fanboy, the Marvel Cinematic universe has now and forever surpassed DC as the king of Comic book films. Avengers Endgame is an outstanding event film, one that will not be topped for a long time."
131,. Sad that an era has ended. Will miss you avengers
132,Great movie...every emoticon was their. Will miss you 3000 times marvel.
133,Felt like there was no room for creative expression. Everything that happened was expected. There was no real surprise. The addition of Captain Marvel just made things worse since it felt like it was forced to be there. Her character is too much and the actress playing her is boring. It looked like nobody on screen wanted to work with her and I can see why. The movie was good but I wanted more from it. It's worth seeing one time but maybe wait until the DVD.
134,"This movie is absolutely incredible. Even though it's three hours long, it feels like two. The Russo brothers really did an amazing job. The dialogue is great and well delivered, and the acting is magnificent. I wasn't left confused at any point, and the audience received just the right amount of information. Because of this, I was nervous throughout the film, and thus, I was never bored.[換行字元][換行字元]Needless to say, this movie is incredible and worth every penny. Go see it, now."
135,"This is the best end possible for a series of 21 movies which will continue though. May not be in relevance with most comic books and comic book lovers, but this is as a movie is best of all time. There are lots of high points, most in recent times. RDJ is amazing , and others as well. A lot of screen time for original avengers."
136,"Although this film way not be the all out action that some may want or expect it is so much more than that, so many story lines are finished, set up to be continued and others are just starting... Marvel really have done this franchise and themselves huge justice! The payout from this film is so worth it and if you don't shed a tear at any point of this film then you simple aren't human, raw emotion. MUST WATCH if you are even a casual marvel/avengers fan!"
137,"Very enjoyable IMAX 3D experience! I love the quantum physics involved, very fascinated by it. A lot of funny jokes & devastating stuff. Top tier Marvel movie difficult to talk about without spoiling anything; definitely worth price of admission - love geeking out for a fun awesome movie!"
138,"Russo Brothers and Writers you are amazing, The script was so so good that's why for 11 years i've been an MCU fan. This movie had everything and so much more, the humour was on point, the music was amazing. Marvel you did it again Thank you Kevin Feige and of cours thank you Stan"
139,"I'm a HUGE Marvel fan and have been so excited for this movie, and to be honest, I'm disappointed. It was a decent movie, and I was invested in the story, but it was no where near my expectations.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie was way too over hyped and in my opinion, messy. Humor was good, emotion was there (at the end), and concept was cool.

I came out of the theater crying a mix of happy and sad tears, but the more I think about it, there were so many flaws (mostly to do with character arcs). It was so fast paced with the characters and ruined the genuine connection we built with them in past movies. It's almost like they're completely different people. All in all, it was an ending we won't forget... even though it kind of flopped."
140,"Just saw this on the 26th. I'm reading all the negative reviews regarding pacing, worst movie ever, worse than Infinity Wars, etc.[換行字元][換行字元]Someone else put it perfect, this is an EXTENSION of Infinity Wars. Don't go in comparing the two, just look at it as the 2nd half (what it really is, and perfect as such, imo). Infinity Wars and Endgame are a combined movie, split, in order to give fans more video. Enjoy that.[換行字元][換行字元]Infinity Wars was the first movie that brought them all together, so that ""triumph"" is gone. I agree, the pacing was slow at points, but, to me, it's like a movie made from a book. Usually movies trim the fat, release the good parts, then watchers complain that certain ""small"" parts weren't in the movie. This is one of those ""extended"" versions that leaves almost everything in. There's just no book to compare it to. So, love the movie and the extra (slow pacing) bits, or move on.[換行字元][換行字元]In the end, without spoilers, go in empty minded, without as much expectation as you can. I've watched every single Marvel film out and I loved this movie, even with the slow parts.

And boy, did they do that![換行字元][換行字元]It's not a ""10"" for thee ""perfect"" movie. But man, the audience was clapping, cheering, 'ooohs,' and 'ahhhhs' throughout. At times, I couldn't even hold myself back from the ""noooo fkn wayy, YES!!"" .[換行字元][換行字元]Go in knowing that Marvel movies are ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS hyped. Don't expect. Just enjoy the roller coaster ride that is sooo much fun!![換行字元][換行字元]It's a 3-hour end to Infinity Wars and every bit of time, worth it, imo."
141,Can't imagine better scenario than this one..unbelievable
142,"Great movie,but not mcu best...not bette rthan civil war and infinity war"
143,"This was an adventurous superhero drama. The best movie I've seen this year. The actors and actresses have found their characters role and their characters relationship towards eachother. This was partly the reason I couldn't enjoy Avengers 1, 2 or Civil War, they had an unnatural holywood-forced story to tell which I just didn't find realistic. Instead of cheesy oneliners the movie explores character depth, there is a superb believable acting, a riveting story and most important of all an entertaining musicscore. At the end my critical brain was asking questions like, why couldn't n.n. do that or how did n.n. do that? This doesn't really matter when you look at the whole picture. The movie delievered one of the most enjoyable emotional experience I've had watching a movie.[換行字元][換行字元]This is one of those movies I could watch a second time. So much details was squeezed into this movie I felt like I must have missed some of them...[換行字元][換行字元]A tip before you see this movie is to watch the clips of each individual background story of the superheroes cause you will get a deeper understanding and connection to the movie. Hope you enjoy it as I did."
144,A solid beautifull beginning... If you have everything of marvel this will be a beautiful ending.. There is always a but... It's not worth mentioning it... Just go see it's every comic readers wet dream come true😂👍
145,"This movie is better than the previous one, infinity war. Worth a watch as an entertaining movie, but I'm not impressed or have anything to remember"
146,"My first review here. All I can say is, thank you Marvel.[換行字元][換行字元]Best movie ever."
147,This is film in my opinion is the best superhero movie I've watched my god I love this movie.
148,"It's simply the best. The culmination of 11 years worth of work, 22 movies of the MCU. This is it. The completion of a story arc started since Iron Man (2008). Great work by the Russo Brothers. Its a roller coster ride throughout the 3 hrs long journey. Part of the journey is the end. You smile, you laugh, you enjoy, you adore, you admire, and at the end, you cry! With the contracts of the main actors ( RDJ, and Evans, as Chris Hemsworth may choose to return) you're going to get emotional seeing them out of the story they began."
149,Amazing. Enjoy the roller coaster. A perfect conclusion to this story arc. 3000/10
150,"There is only one word to describe this film, a Masterpiece! This movie is the best movie I have ever seen! The fact the Russo Brothers made it 3 hours long was a great idea, I never felt bored nor disappointed during the 3 hours of the film. The movie's ending (in my opinion) is the best moment in cinematic history!"
151,"Spoiler free review! I cried, I laughed, I cried and I laughed again and this is what we all did throughout the movie. The direction of MCU and particularly for this movie is unbelievable. All characters, as well as the story, are giving a perfect end to the Saga. MUST MUST MUST WATCH! You won't be able to control your emotions.❤"
152,"8/10[換行字元][換行字元]To properly understand the motives of the characters in this film, start by viewing the first output of Marvel Studios. Over 21 films make up the backlog of this saga. That's how big Avengers: Endgame is.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers: Endgame closes the saga in emphatic fashion, juggling multiple story arcs without feeling overstuffed. Each character is given a story that is organic and flows directly from previous events. With a villain whose characterization is better than the last, the heroes race to return and save the world they once knew. No action scene is there for the mere spectacle, instead they serve a greater purpose that builds up for the final showdown. Speaking of action, as the farewell of the saga, it delivers in spades that is sure to make the general audience and fans alike stand on their seats. Endgame is simply a tribute to the fans of the franchise, giving them its best moments in action and drama."
153,"I laughed, cried and loved every moment and act 3 is the definition of fan service, must see film, best film of the year or of all time"
154,"Wow, that was a major anti climax. With a title as 'Endgame' you'd expect it to surpass every story before, not an endless get together, 1 major battle where 1 action here solves it all and then a lengthy farewell. Wished they would have spent more on a good script instead of on 1 big scene full of CGI"
155,"While watching #AvengersEndgame, I laughed too much, I clapped too much and I cried so hard. The movie exceeds every expectation and is the perfect condition of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.[換行字元][換行字元]Watch all 21 MCU movies before watching #endgame[換行字元][換行字元]We love you 3000 times..."
156,It was the best Avengers move hever!! I remained speechless!!
157,For 3 hours the movie was not boring at all. Great action also
158,"Another masterpiece of marvel.Endgame is the last episode of avenger series .and a heartbreaking movie for al marvel die hard fans. thanos again prove that what he is? the plot was very clear. a little comedy argument ego between superheros, but they survived and stand against thanos. very well performance of all superheros.into the end a big surprise ending of movies. a sad but perfect ending of endgame movies. most awaited movie is in theater so if u r a true marvel fan of like roger , stark, thor or else dont wait go near cinema and enjoy all marvel heroes together."
159,"Pure cinematic mastery. This film was perfect from start to finish, there was not one scene I didn't enjoy. It's unbelievable that marvel can still raise the roof after 10 years.[換行字元][換行字元]This was the most satisfying conclusion to anything I have ever watched. Most films fall short if they're ending a trilogy or saga but endgame didn't fall Flat it was triumphant and breath taking. Please see this film!!!"
160,I really enjoyed this movie. Not only did this movie have great actors.. very good story line and I love the way they throw in some comedy too. Enjoyable and entertaining.
161,"It's the most epic movie I have ever seen, the movie starts slow and funny but the last 15 minutes will be the best experience you will ever have in your life. Go watch the movie"
162,"This is the best superhero movie ever. A perfect culminations on those twenty and something movies: it's masterfully knitted into Marvel Cinematic Universe. People in cinema were laughing, crying and applauding. It's a great blend of drama and action. There are so many scenes that are unique and beautiful. ...And the ending is memorable... This is a perfect ending of one MCU epoch and it's hard to believe they will ever be able to top this. And for that I feel sad."
163,"Amazing film, definitely worth seeing in cinemas. So many moments that I didn't expect. Overall the movie is a satisfying conclusion to the infinity saga."
164,"Watching Avengers Endgame would go down as the experience of a lifetime, which will give you gamut of emotions ranging from laughter, goosebumps , crying and lots of crying. It is a great send off to some of our heroes. There is so much to write but i dont want to ruin anyone else's experience. Well Done Marvel....... :)"
165,"I have got to admit that I expected so much from this movie, the first half made me think ""Hmm I hope this is not gonna last like this"". Then of course, the second half started where the movie actually begins for me. The last hour was so much breath-taking that all of us clapped together (especially in some scenes that I can't spoil for your own good), we cried together and we got excited like little children! This is more than a movie for me as that it made me realise my young years are spent with MCU and as a 30 year old adult I want to thank MCU, Stan Lee, Russo Brothers and of course the unbelievably talented cast of Avengers! This is an unbelievable experience that every comic fan should try at least one time in their life! MCU once again nailed. Sincerely thanks everyone that worked in it. Incredible!"
166,"I can not say any except thank you marvel, mcu ends in excellent way"
167,"This movie was stunning. Imax, Dolby Atmos, 3D, all the amazing features you get at a movie theatre is needed to get the best cinematic experience to this epic extraordinary ending to an 11 year cinematic universe. You cry, laugh, gasp, cry till the very last second of the film. You really start to feel old when you watch this film and experience probably the most anticipated sequel of this century yet."
168,What an epic ending. You better go to the restroom first before entering the cinema.
169,It's rewind time everybody! I hate this movie. Go away.
170,"This was a great movie and a proper end to the series.[換行字元][換行字元]Besides some convoluted continuity issues, it was very well done.[換行字元][換行字元]And the best part of all, minimal screen time for the newest and most widely hated Avenger of the bunch, CM."
171,"I was expecting a little bit of a letdown with this movie. It had a lot to live up to, and a lot to accomplish to wrap up this phase of movies. I was pleasantly surprised that there was no let down. For me this was a perfect ending to the Infinity War. There was just enough fun and funny parts to offset the times the movie made me cry. This movie had the whole theater laughing and crying. While I wish it could have ended differently for a couple of the hero's, but then it wouldn't have been as good of a movie."
172,"Great visuals and sound, solid acting and directing. A few problems with the plot, mostly surrounding the use of time travel (can't say more without major spoilers but it's mostly consistency issues). But overall a solid finale to the first three phases of the franchise."
173,"Im not the usual type of people that review movie after watched it.[換行字元][換行字元]But i cant hold it for this one. The visuals are great, the sounds are perfectly fit, the story, the battle, the character. Basically almost everything are perfect for this one!![換行字元][換行字元]Great job Marvel, thank you. I really enjoy the endgame."
174,"A good end to this line of marvel films and looking forward to future marvel, with the superheroes going forward.."
175,100% Perfect conclusion to the MCU. Couldn't have asked for a better end to the saga.
176,Perfect ending for so many characters we loved for 10 years.
177,"Easily the worst MCU movie even worse than Ragnarök, with ita only redeeming qualities being a beautiful, though rushed, ending to the first arc of the MCU and the occasional moment of heartfelt nostalgia.[換行字元][換行字元]Instead of delivering on any of the setup from the last movies, e.g. the unresolved conflict from Civil War and pulling a The Last Jedi, they veered off into a trip down memory lane and threw out any kind of internal logic in order to so, with the result being that most of movie feels like filler.[換行字元][換行字元]Further in analogy to TLJ they chose to undercut almost every emotional scene with terrible comedy and they turned characters such as Thor and Hulk, who had almost recovered from their excruciating treatment in Ragnarök, into caricatures of their Avengers 1 glory.[換行字元][換行字元]I almost could not bear remaining in the cinema until the last few minutes of mostly genuine emotion."
178,"This movie was a proper letdown for me, mainly due to it being made in service of the characters and not in service of the movie, unlike Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]I think this movie could've been great or even a masterpiece, because Infinity War certainly was, but for people that aren't invested in the characters and don't like that same old corny comedy and totally predictable outcomes (and major plot holes), it was definitely a letdown.[換行字元][換行字元]I'm not saying it's a bad film, how could it? It's a good film that could've been great, that's all I'm saying."
179,"No its not perfect. But it was amazing, spectacular, phenomenal. And this morons above giving it low scores are dumb as F#ck. They must be hipsters. I guess they fell asleep. Very emotional movie."
180,"This movie is a must see in the theaters. The experience is unlike anything I have ever felt in my entire life. This is a perfect conclusion to the MCU as we know it. Marvel Studios managed to wrap up eleven years in this beautiful, heartfelt, emotional, funny, and action packed film. It is a kiss on the forehead to every MCU fan. I felt so happy and joyful while watching this. Clap, cheer, be openly happy while watching this, I can guarantee that it will add to the experience. Please, go watch this movie and bask in its glory!"
181,"Avengers: Endgame is about memories, nostalgia and tons of fan-service moments. This is a movie that understands its audience and fans, trying to give each character's story closure without forgetting to provide valuable entertainment for the whole crowd. It also might be a tad too cheesy for some people's taste, particularly when there's a comedic relief scene.[換行字元][換行字元]My biggest concern coming into this movie was the insertion of bland and uninspired jokes that plagued my overall solid experience in ""Infinity War"". This film was an improvement in that regard but it isn't without its cringe-inducing moments. Things like the ""Fortnite"" scene (and more than that I won't say) just made me roll my eyes. It's unbelievable how they manage to overkill it with these comedic scenes that are so painfully unnecessary and do nothing to advance the plot. I understand that you're trying to make your audience have a good time and all, but this is just unbearable.[換行字元][換行字元]Other than that, the comedy - I thought - worked just nicely for the most part. The jokes that existed didn't ruin the tension.[換行字元][換行字元]The characters were very central in this movie. Some characters shined; others not so much. I didn't like ""Captain Marvel"" and I certainly don't like the titular character, so I was grateful that she was underused in this movie. Everytime she's on screen and she smiles at the camera, it feels as though the actress is trying to show charisma, but there's none whatsoever. Not that the actress is awful - it's simply that she is not as interesting as the writers are portraying her to be. I know some critics enjoyed Chris Hemsworth's performance and the character, but it's sad to see that the character is reduced to a comedic relief (again).[換行字元][換行字元]The movie also boasts an impressive budget, with so many set-pieces and computer-generated effects to be observed. This element of the movie provided the writers with so many angles to explore the story. While ""Avengers: Endgame"" is three hours long, the narrative is entertaining enough to overcome the more stale sequences. The movie never feels dull and it keeps you in the edge of your seat. I had a fun time watching it.[換行字元][換行字元]7/10."
182,"No spoilers here![換行字元][換行字元]I'll keep it short and sweet, it's a solid film and I enjoyed it, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. Would I reccomend you go and see it? Of course! You should just keep your expectations within reason."
183,Could not ask for a better conclusion to what can only be described as an epic group of movies. Did not feel 3hrs at all. Thank you MARVEL!
184,I mean it's okay to not like a movie but seriously 1 star reviews do not change the fact that avengers endgame despite its flaws is still an incredible achievement.
185,So i just watched it for the second time yesterday and i have to be honest this movie is boring as hell until the final fight and now that I watched it for the second time the final fight was ok this movie is so overated in my eyes firat time i watched it i was nearly falling asleep in theater because nothing intersting was happenning people going to hate me for this but I dont care I had more fun watching Dark Phonenix then this boring ass movie mcu movies are so overated in my opinion!
186,"...A cinematic/comic masterpiece... A multitude of emotions meet and leave and meet you over and over. A tidal wave of humanity and feelings delivered in 3000 loving spades... My imagined quote from director Kevin Smith would be,""Infinitely pleased I've stayed alive to see this event""."
187,"Most electrifying scenes of all time, most emotional scenes of all time, greatest action, hardest goodbyes, comedy, tear rolling big six credits... and so much more. I just wish the writers gave Iron man and Thor their own great moments to shine during the fight with thanos."
188,"Not perfect, but still one of the best action films I've ever seen (alongside Infinity Wars) and the only film I've watched twice at the cinema. In a word, epic."
189,"This is the best unexpected movie you're gonna see,whatever theories you think you have throw that in garbage disposer because nothing and absolutely nothing can make you ready for this"
190,"I watched Endgame in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a little of chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing![換行字元][換行字元]It may have taken 11 years, 21 films but Endgame finally has shown redemption Connecting and linking this movie with the past films is not easy and smart direction from Joe Russo and Anthony Russo. It is not only about superpowers but about love commitment, compassion and sacrifice. Tony Stark removes his ego and Steve Rogers finally got what he wanted.[換行字元][換行字元]The only con of this movie was the running time. The three hours could have been scrapped or at least an interval to go to the loo.![換行字元][換行字元]My score= 8.5/10"
191,Awesome Awesome Awesome awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awes
192,"Avengers Endgame - what a disappointment. Too long, too boring and too sappy. What was I watching - soap opera? Low on action, full on drama, corny dialogues about friendship and family. The hall was supposed to be houseful according to bookmyshow and PVR, bullshit, it had less than 1/4 seats full. Something very fishy is going on. Totally anti climactic after Infinity Wars and Thor Ragnarok. The direction Marvel has chosen after Captain Marvel and Now this. Seems like films are statistically driven now, with an eye on how to make the film click - by hook or crook. Captain Marvel - Woman driven, here too there is one scene clearly pushing that agenda. In the last battle there is a shot where all the woman get together for the final fight - just by chance. The entire focus for this move was, high on emotions, must have done some calculations for that is what the box office collection tell.[換行字元][換行字元]If I had got an honest review I would have given this movie a skip, you should too."
193,Best marvel movie I ever seen. Just I didn't like Hulks and Captain Marvels scenes are lower then others
194,"Way too long, drawn out and long winded. Very little action in it. Very little funny humor. Way too much cringe in it. Especially the ""SJW girl power"" scene towards the end. Massive cheese fest at the end. Couldn't wait for it to end while in the cinema. I enjoyed the last film but this was well below average. These 10/10 reviews are just Marvel fanboys I think."
195,"Though the movie drags on a bit at the middle russo brothers have done an excellent job. Really, a nostalgic experience for all marvel fans."
196,Go watch it! dasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasd sdasdasdasdas dasdasdasda ddas dsad as d sdasdassdasdasdasdasd
197,"#Genius is the only word that comes to my mind when I think about the movie. Moving the story from a crowd favourite #Thanos to superheroes who hardly use their superpower in initial 1hr is biggest narrative risk I seen in ages. From script to direction to acting to conclusion of main characters journey is done perfectly. I got a sore throat just by cheering (for cameos & for fan favorite scenes), so was the whole theater. To sum up if you're a #superhero genre lover, this is the Bestest product out there (It was for me)."
198,"Alright, who am I kidding, even that is an understatement. There's just no words to describe it. It is so engaging and enthralling from the very beginning to the end. And for a Marvel Fan, there's not and could never be an experience quite like it. Even if you use all the good adjectives to describe it, that won't be enough! It is going to stay close to my heart for all eternity."
199,"Not a full review cause I don't feel like doing one.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame was fine. It's riddled with far too many plot holes, cringy humor and weird character choices for me to give it anything over a 5. Hulk and Thor are completely butchered here as characters imo. The 2nd act is boring and does every time travel cliché you could think of, third act however, although blatant fan service is fun and exciting to watch. 3rd act basically saves the movie. The main reason I saw this was to see how Captain America's arc ends since he is one of the few characters I care about in the mcu. Unfortunately Iron Man's arc is done way better here compared to Cap's. No spoilers but Captain America's ending is shoehorned in at the last second and makes no sense. It felt completely unnatural . Oh yeah and hulk dabs, in the year 2023."
200,"The best Marvel movie! You will laugh, cry of hapiness and sadness, it just leaves you in this indescribable state of mind. It has it all. Russo brothers really are geniuses and it shows with this film. The ending won't leave you unsatisified. I will definately watch it again and again and again!"
201,"The ending dropped me and my wife tears, really strong ending"
202,"This movie exceeded my expectations, surprised, and drew every emotion from me. The trailers really reveals nothing essential to the plot and the whole movie really is a surprise. Just when you think you get it, something else throws you for a loop.[換行字元][換行字元]It did not feel like 3 hours long due to the endless amount of attention to the characters development and never ending action.[換行字元][換行字元]The ending was honestly perfect and after watching it I can not think of a better way for it to end.[換行字元][換行字元]Defiantly go out and see it, won't be another movie like this for a while."

Running Time: 3Hrs 2minutes[換行字元][換行字元]I don't know where to start. Reviewing this movie is beyond my expertise, but I'll just say what's on my mind. First things first, use the washroom before the movie starts because there's no interval in this 3h 2m movie and you do not want to miss any single minute of this gem of a movie.[換行字元][換行字元]It's been just over a decade since MARVEL STUDIOS launched its flagship with 2008's Iron Man and ever since then movie experience has changed for us. Being a movie fan I cannot imagine a world without MARVEL movies. I mean being a 90's kid I've grown up with these MARVEL characters. It's part of us now and we'll feel a void if they aren't there anymore. After 10 years and 21 films the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes to an end with The Avenger: Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame only has one real job: to move the MCU forward past Infinity War's climactic horror. Every moment of Endgame feels like it was made with that in mind - to convey the audience past the shock and into grief, anger, hope, and tremendous excitement. It was made for the kind of fans that will collectively gasp in shock at every significant twist (and there are a few huge ones), then cheer in relief at every climactic blow for the future integrity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The entire film is constructed of callbacks, references, reminders, and reminiscences. So if you're one of those people who has never seen a MARVEL movie before, and is watching the Endgame just for the hype then you might get confused as to what's happening. You know we had these scrapbooks before where our friends used to write stuffs about us. If you still have that then that's Endgame for you. The Endgame is like MCU's scrapbook or an anniversary project.[換行字元][換行字元]All the other MARVEL movies were so brilliantly made that you could watch it as a standalone movie, but not endgame. Endgame was never designed to stand on its own as a single well-crafted movie, and it was never designed to follow the MCU formula. It was designed to cap a decade of buildup around a single gigantic story. So, you might wanna see some previous MARVEL movies in order to understand this one. You've got to watch ""The Avengers, Captain America: The first Avenger , Thor: The Dark World , Civil War, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Infinity War""[換行字元][換行字元]This Endgame is all about the original Avengers. I'm not saying that others don't have a role, they have, they definitely play huge part in the end game, but it all revolves around the originals. You will see them doing stuffs which you cannot even imagine, but must have definitely wondered at some point.[換行字元][換行字元]The Endgame was one of the fastest 3 hours of my life. I never looked at my watch once because it's very hard to take your eyes off the big screen. It really has been an epic ride and I feel privileged to have been able to be a part of it. Though only being an audience, I feel connected to these characters, they are like long know friends. Endgame is the epic and monumental end to the saga which began over a decade ago. And oh it is more than worthy to be the last milestone on this incredible journey.[換行字元][換行字元]The trailers are deceptive so don't believe them as you have no idea what you're going to witness. A colossal conclusion, a proper ending for an epic saga. It brought you to the beginning; it reminded you of all the years you have invested. Then boom, here is the dessert that makes you overwhelmed and craved at the same time.[換行字元][換行字元]The Russo's have crafted a masterpiece and set a benchmark for other Studios. The Endgame is a perfect conclusion to the MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE. You couldn't have asked for more. The ending is so satisfyingly emotional that you can't help but give a standing ovation.[換行字元][換行字元]I would like to just add another thing; there are no end credits (this isn't a spoiler), so it would be really helpful for the people who are cleaning your mess after you've watched the movie, to finish their work quickly. Endgame is running 24x7 and you've got to respect the theatre staff as they're working like crazy. Don't keep waiting as there are others MARVEL fans who are impatiently waiting outside the theatre for their show to start.[換行字元][換行字元]Verdict: A MUST WATCH 6 / 5 stars. Yes you read that right."
207,"No words...absolutely incredible, THE best way to end the whole series. Watching all the movies to finish with this, every single hour was worth it, hats off to Marvel 👏🏽"
208,"Great comeback after infinity war. Bring all the dust back to life. Great story line, laughs, cry, claps all the audience. Great cinematic experience... love love love. Thank you for another great movie"
209,I was just expecting more action... I was relatively bored for the first 2/3 of the movie.
210,Best marvel movie so far Absolutely brilliant Would recommend for anyone 100%
211,"This is by far the worst MCU movie I've ever seen. Ever.[換行字元][換行字元]I was looking forward to it after last year's Infinity War, to see how they would bounce back from that Thanos snap. But boy, was I disappointed. The whole ""time heist"" plot is tortuously senseless, it lacks any form of intelligence from any aspect, be it scientific or imaginative. What kind of ""writers"" are responsible for this? Or what were they on while ""writing"" this? The quick one-liners, barbs and quips are cringe-worthy and so are the ""comedic"" situations.[換行字元][換行字元]One can objectively agree that the movie is way too long and boring for the first two hours, even my 11 yo super-fan brother thought so. It offers very little entertainment. The plot is too incoherent for any sensible adults and very complex to follow for the young ones so they just eagerly await the battle finale. Which does arrive at the end in the form of a badly choreographed CGI bukake scene with pyrotechnics and many, many cuts for anyone to follow what the heck is going on.[換行字元][換行字元]Massive, glaring plot-holes abound from start to finish which I bet are invisible to the throngs of fanboys all over the world over-hyping and claiming this piece of hot, leaky garbage to be the greatest movie ever made. Along with giving it over the top reviews and ratings.[換行字元][換行字元]Can't believe this is what sells to the masses and makes studios billions of dollars now. Makes me lose all hope in future superhero movies. I couldn't wait for it to get over and go home. A complete waste of time."
212,Prefer movies like interstellar than this. Done with Avengers.
213,I Love this movie i have no words about this movie all heros are love
214,"One word review , MARVELOUS. The ending made all cry, but I think it was for good. A happy farewell to all our beloved superheroes."
215,"This movie was a love letter to the mcu fans thst have been there since 10 years ago. Filled with reverences to earlier movies and full of easter eggs.[換行字元][換行字元]I agree that some characters did not get what they deserve, but that did not bother me, because the movie was so great that it negated it for me. Some characters had great arcs in this movie. Especially 2 characters.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie was a emotional rollercoaster. But it was great. Already seen it 3 times and still counting!"
216,"The end of an era, Endgame wraps up the Infinity Saga in epic fashion, with massive fan service, emotional gravitas, a darker Thanos, psychological war-aftermath reflection, & one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster history. 9.4/10.[換行字元][換行字元]...[換行字元][換行字元]10 years, 21 movies, 32 heroes. The MCU as we know it just came to an end, and did so as epically as one could have possibly expected. Avengers: Endgame is one of, if not THE best and definitive Marvel film - and absolutely warrants the hype.[換行字元][換行字元]The film opens into a desolate landscape post-Infinity War where our heroes are still coming to terms with the magnitude of their failure. Despite glimpses of levity-full psychological war aftermath reflection on topics like survivor's guilt and PTSD, I'll admit: I was mildly disappointed with the first act. Overly comedic and light-defused in tone, it's a bit discordant with the tragic events that just happened to trillions of life forms. It was also a bit anticlimactic having them find and confront Thanos so easily and early. However, these flaws are mostly sequestered in the first third (despite a weird intellectual Hulk and fat Thor just horrifying to watch), and are ~easily forgiven in light of what follows.[換行字元][換行字元]Everything after the first act is masterful, dazzling fan service on a massive scale that will leave any Marvel or superhero fan speechless with their jaw-dropped. The middle act's time travel plotting makes for some incredible scenarios visiting past MCU films and having heroes interacting with their past selves. This was the magic of DC's Flashpoint comic arc, and although the film borrows its idea, it executes it perfectly. Thrillingly paced are the signature smooth-fluid action sequences The Russo Brothers are known for and exhibited ever since The Winter Soldier, as well as strong direction and intricate handling of such a monstrous scale of a story arc trying to beat Thanos before he even knows what's happened.[換行字元][換行字元]The Avengers once again find solace in the splitting up of them into mini-teams leading to some hilarious and intriguing character combinations different from Infinity War. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye now Ronin, and the rest of the original 6 (plus a few others) are sent off into different teams and time periods to retrieve the stones, and it makes for some incredible entertainment value alone worth the price of admissions to watch. The Easter Eggs and cameos are downright legendary, showcasing what we already learned in IW: Anthony and Joe Russo are huge Marvel junkies who know and love the films/comics as much as the person reading this review.[換行字元][換行字元]Thanos and his far darker tone. Thanos is also off scouring for the Stones while all this is happening. His pulling of the strings in things like sending rogues and strategically planting things to upset the Avengers' plans make him far more imposing than his rogue commando style in IW. Much akin to what Darkseid - DC's original titan/god that came out first and, yes, Thanos was cloned from - would be like, there's far more power in resources at your disposal and being able to fling them at your will. He also has a bite and far darker tone here, being pissed off The Avengers are wrecking his plans after knowing he won and promising to not only kill half of life now, but ALL life and start over again under his rule.[換行字元][換行字元]Finally, the final act. I cannot even find the words to describe how legendary the final act of Endgame is - it might be one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster HISTORY. Like the Wakanda war on acid, this massive scale battle starting with the three most iconic Avengers against Thanos and evolving into a sheer epic warzone with every Marvel character you could possibly imagine, it will leave any fan speechless. And that's nothing compared to the heart-breaking ending with sacrifices that do the characters proud and have potentially-massive implications for the future of the MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, while there are nits to pick from its ~anticlimactic humorous opening to its handling of Thor/Hulk to its lack of a post-credits scene (REALLY wanted an X-Men or Eternals tease..), Avengers: Endgame is an absolutely masterful film that delivers just about everything you could expect from it as a follow-up to Infinity War. The end of an era, Avengers: Endgame wraps up the Infinity Saga in epic fashion, with massive fan service, emotional gravitas, a darker Thanos, psychological war aftermath reflection, and one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster HISTORY. It will be dang near impossible to wait to see what comes next.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall Score: 9.4/10"

Some fans will be in awe to see what happens.[換行字元]The cinematography is beautiful and lots of shots are stunning and would give Film Theory a run for its money (Not saying much but whatever).[換行字元]The emotion is gut-wrenching. If you have stuck with these movies; you WILL cry.[換行字元]The film focused on the characters that bettered the story. Some characters appeared briefly, but when so it worked![換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]Cons;[換行字元]The humour whilst not undercutting any serious emotion is not as refined as the other movies. Still funny but not AS funny as (Example) Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]Verdict; The mould is broken, the tables have turned. As a beautiful show of the MCU's patience & Storytelling, Avengers: Endgame exceeds its hype, it's expectations and will break you. See it whilst you can in cinema."
218,The Movie which tops every aspect and amazingly entertained us for 3 hrs...The set up of MCU makes an epic end to the endgame....WOW out of words.
219,"Avengers EndGame Is Literally The Definition Of A True SuperHero Movie , From Hilarious Moments To Truly HeartBreaking Moments To A Final Act And And Finish That Will Blow Your Mind. This Is Simply A Must Watch ... One Of The Greatest Movies Of All Time , The End Is Here And The End Is ""MARVEL""OUS !!!"
220,If you have been following the Marvel Franchise for a while now you will watch this movie and realize that this movie wraps up one of the most compelling storylines about superheroes we've ever seen in a very classy way. I don't think it is better than infinity War but it is by far the best way I can think off to end the Marvel's Avengers Franchise. Brilliant!
221,"Love every single moments from this movie. I couldn't be happier with the ending. There were so many scenes I bursted out laughing and also many scenes I seriously cried because we are in the endgame now, it is expected. I would definitely go watch Endgame again tomorrow to recap all the favorite scenes.[換行字元][換行字元]Love this movie 3000 times"
222,"Over 10 years of action packed and engaging Marvel superheroes, the endgame is finally here-Avengers: Endgame is a stellar movie about such topics as loss, revenge, responsibility, and learning from mistakes made, and moving on from them.[換行字元][換行字元]The leading cast is Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, and Bradley Cooper, playing Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, and Rocket (among other actors, respectively). The directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, return from the many Marvel films they have directed previously.[換行字元][換行字元]The film itself is not the usual Marvel film; it's three hours long, and features many new plot twists and techniques to make it stand out among the other films. Going into it, expect some slight deviation from the traditional Marvel formula-like comparing Infinity War to the original The Avengers. It's set after the events of Avengers: Infinity War, and deals with the losses that the remaining Avengers suffer in their quest to renew themselves, by the means that they choose.[換行字元][換行字元]The music and scenes of the film are crisp and beautiful. Color always fills every frame of this film; almost like eye-candy in a motion picture. The action is amazing, and will leave you breathless at some points. Along with the orchestral music in the background, scenes can be very upbeat or even bring viewers to tears. It overall builds on the foundation that Infinity War had laid out a year ago, and is similar in some of its structure.[換行字元][換行字元]Although, there is one complaint that audiences and myself generally find after viewing. Its plot at times can be a bit spotty, leading viewers to question some of the decisions and actions. And the first quarter to half starts out a bit slow for a Marvel movie. But near the end of the film, most of these thoughts begin to dissipate. The last hour of this movie is raw action, and a setting and place where the stakes couldn't be higher.[換行字元][換行字元]The hype for this movie has been building since last year, and translated into it grossing $1.2 billion at the box office in its opening weekend alone, smashing previous Hollywood records by a wide margin. It's set to be one of the highest grossing movies of all time, along with Titanic, Avatar, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. And with its average rating of 87% across the main three movie review boards (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and RedBox), this certainly is an above average film considering other options.[換行字元][換行字元]While this movie might not be for everyone, it can be interesting to even a casual movie viewer, and all the more interesting to someone who likes Marvel or superhero movies in general. The movie can both make you laugh and cry in the span of just a couple of scenes-truly an emotional experience for some.[換行字元][換行字元]The culmination of more than 10 years of Marvel films have built up to this amazing movie, and it's definitely worth it. The cast, picture, and soundtrack is at its best with this movie; it's a must watch. I would say that this is my favorite superhero movie right now, and definitely on my top 15 movies list."
223,"I'm putting a 9 there because I know that my emotions got in the way of what would have been a critical viewing.[換行字元][換行字元]No spoilers, so that takes away any explaining that might go into that, but know that if you have been following the films closely over the past decade or so, you will be feeling emotional by the end as well.[換行字元][換行字元]The actors performed their roles well, the story is well written, there are some well-timed laughs stuck in the middle of what is an appropriately somber film. The writing is well done, the score is fantastic, everything that we've come to expect from Marvel films.[換行字元][換行字元]The fact that it closes the Infinity Saga so well is what puts it head and shoulders above the others, I think.[換行字元][換行字元]Would recommend to friends, and probably will be watching it again."
224,A good movie for 12 years old kids! Super heroic movies don't belong in top 250 unless they're Nolan's dark Knight or philipses Joker. Marvel uses politics to win just like all other over-rated movies we're seeing these days. Cheers to the pure old cinema.
225,Today is 24th april and I booked the ticket of 28th april and I know it is the best movie would I watched ever.so I already rated 10 out of 10. Love from india.
226,The best movie I have ever seen. Refrain from spoilers because the experience is unlike any other
227,"Well, Russo brothers did it again. Those 3 hours felt like half hour or less. After watching this story reached its end, I really must say - there is no movie universe like MCU. I love DC and other superhero movies also, but after seeing Endgame - everyone (and that includes future Marvel) really must try hard to beat this 10 years long story and I hope that it will happen again. A man can hope, right?[換行字元][換行字元]If you read any comic book that has really good story with real stakes (every hero can die) that spans over years and you reached its final number, climax of it all and you are blown away by it - I'm sure you will recognize that feeling while watching this movie (especially in the final GREAT scene, but I don't want to spoil it to you).[換行字元][換行字元]When I came home from cinema, I needed another ""shot"" of our heroes so I immidiately watched first Avengers movie and Avengers: Age of Ultron. But that is not enough: today I will watch Infinity war at home and Endgame once more in cinema.[換行字元][換行字元]Than you all for a great movie(s)![換行字元][換行字元]Avengers - Assemble!"
228,The storytelling is magnificent everything scenes fits the story since it's a culmination of 22 movies. Thanks Russo brothers and the entire marvel entertainment especially Kevin fiege
229,The film does a great job of connecting to all the Marvel movies from the past. The 3 hr run times seemed to fly past.
230,I'm not sure I've ever see such carefully crafted character arcs in super hero movies as in the MCU. This film is a fitting conclusion to so many characters we've grown to love. I had assumed Endgame would have a hard time living up to Infinity War. However my expectations were surpassed. Well done!
231,Ok i dont understand why somr people give this 10/10 or 9/10 and call it perfect. There is so many problems and so many good things especialy the final 30 minutes. This movie biggest problem is pacing and story and inconsistency with it and its 3 hours long which is so unnecesary and i was realy Actualy kind of bored.also captain marvel ruined the movie for me even more.[換行字元][換行字元]5/10 decent
232,"Absolute deconstruction of original characters and the universe, this nonsensical circus seems only aiming to cram as much ""political correctness"", painful attempts at humor and cheap pathos into torturous 3 hours. One can only wish for infinity gauntlet to snap away the bad acting, horrible scenario and hollywood itself."
233,"My rating for this one is a 5. I almost fell asleep at the first half of the movie. The storytelling is poor, acting is so so, fight sequences are not what I expected. I liked Infinity War much better. My expectation from a 9.1 score movie was pretty high and I was very excited to see this one. But what a disappointment."
234,"It's like when you meet again after 12 years an old SUPER HOT girlfriend, and she is coming with her 2 children and the first one is 11 years old. Pfff. I am a big fan of the previous film. This one is a generous 5/10. Robert D. Jr. is great. And...maybe Thor.The end."
235,"Avengers: Endgame is the fourth Avengers film and the newest film from the Marvel film series. The film is directed by the Russo brothers, who also directed the previous Avengers film Avengers: Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]After the actions of Thanos (Josh Brolin) from the previous Avengers movie, the remaining Avengers have to deal with the consequences of their loss. Still, the Avengers must eventually look for a way to defeat Thanos and see if there is a way to undo his dark actions.[換行字元][換行字元]With this fourth Avengers film, the Russo brothers and scriptwriters were able to put a nice end to the eleven-year series of 22 films. The Russo brothers have also done their best to fill the film further with things that Marvel fans would like to see or they provide answers to some unanswered questions from previous Marvel films. For most Marvel fans this film can come across as a satisfactory ending. Although this film comes across as the end of the series, they have left enough free space for the next phase of the Marvel film series. They have already planned some new films and TV series for the future. Although they have these new plans, these new films will probably no longer be able to reach the same level as they did with Avengers Endgame and the eleven-year build-up to this film. Despite these future plans, they do not give anything away for the next phase of Marvel. This Marvel film, for example, has no extra scenes that still appear in the film during or after the credits. In this way, when the film is over and the lights in the room turn on again, you can actually leave the room. The only reason to remain seated during the credits is if you may want to know the names of people who have worked on certain things in the film.[換行字元][換行字元]The atmosphere and tempo of Endgame are also different compared to Infinity War, because In Infinity War there were more action scenes and intense events that they managed to play at a relatively fast pace, but still had enough room for humorous moments. In Endgame they have a more dramatic atmosphere after losing to Thanos. The pace can also seem a bit slower, because they are mainly busy processing their loss at the beginning of the film, but also planning what they can do best now.[換行字元][換行字元]The effects in the film also look good and credible. This way they know how to convey or bring certain things in this film in fun and creative ways. They must have used a lot of CGI and a green screen for these effects, but this is hardly reflected in the film.[換行字元][換行字元]The acting work is also done well. Many actors and actresses can be seen in this film in their famous roles. Most of the remaining Avenger characters are also in different locations or in a different life status than we are used to. In this way, the actors who play these roles have also had the opportunity to present their known roles in a different way. In this film every hero gets his own personal moment to shine. They know for example Captain Marvel, who in her own film was not received equally positively by everyone, in a somewhat better way."
236,"The movie is an epic conclusion of the Infinity Saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and with it's 3 hours it feels so short. The easter eggs and references from the other movies gives an excelent bonus to the movie, although is not perfect for some minor details, it's an outstanding conclusion and makes us want more of the MCU."
237,"This movie is the apex of cinema for my generation. They give you every emotion possible, love, hate, tension and the balance is just perfect. When you think something will happen you got bamboozled. The characters mix is perfect, soundtrack, action scenes and everything else."
238,"I never knew how much a movie could impact me like Avengers Endgame did. Not much words can explain this movie but one can and that one is ""BRILLIANT""!"
239,I can't top the other reviews apart from this is truly fantastic and worth every penny to go see in the iMax 3D...never thought it would be possible to shed a tear at the end of a Marvel film..
240,Endgame wins the hearts...loved it... Superb and fantastic
241,"This movie. What an experience. The things this movie does right overshadow any issues with the plot that may have surfaced. This film is not just a movie, it is an experience. It takes you though highs and lows, slow parts and fast ones. Moments that will break your heart and ones that will make you scream with excitement.[換行字元][換行字元]Do yourself a favor, watch it. It is absolutely one of the greatest cinematic events in the history of US Cinema. This is the first Marvel movie that should be a 10/10.[換行字元][換行字元]Watch it, enjoy it, realize that the Infinity series is over.[換行字元][換行字元]Masterpiece."
242,"This movie had so much hype. It was a buildup of 11 years, 22 movies. The expectations that come with that are absolutely enormous. Yet this movie exceeded all of my expectations. I have no words to describe the sheer awesomeness that occurs. It might just be the most masterful cinematic masterpiece ever created. It drags at the beginning and can even be boring at times, but when the action picks up, it certainly delivers. The third act makes everything worth it. The sheer scope of this is straight from a comic. And it's not just the epic battle scenes that carry so much weight and incredible CGI. The emotional impact after the final battle is just amazing. The Russo's pulled it off. This is my favorite movie of the MCU and maybe of all time. It has every great moment you could want out of a cinematic experience. It delivers and everyone should see it. Simply incredible"
243,"Loved the movie, but i still like Infinity War better!"
244,The film has no pace besides the big battle that in fact is to short and feels like nothing according to what I expected for a new fight with e thanos[換行字元][換行字元]Some character directions of important heroes like Thor and hulk where ridiculous . And these characters contributed nothing to the stories besides transmitting weakness[換行字元][換行字元]Also the movie was overwhelmed by overpowering woman and non white characters . I understand the need to give equal importance to every king of heroe but not to the cost of the most importa ones .[換行字元][換行字元]Also the script was full of things without logic
245,"Well, after Infinity War being such a successful movie. Endgame continues this. With 3 hours of content (yet it will only feel like 1.5 hours). We get to really see the Avengers Assemble having their High's and Low's throughout the film. There a definitely some emotional scenes and some awesome scenes as the Avengers make a comeback against Thanos. You will not be disappointed by this film. So enjoy every moment of it!"
246,"Soooo. Just finished the movie and this will not contain any spoilers but I need to voice my heart to all Marvel lovers... 22 movies over 11 years and this one movie profoundly used all of them in the final conclusion. My heart is saddened by the end but so over joyed by the extreme care the Russo brothers took to preserve stan lees finally curtain call. This movie was the perfect mix of humor and emotion and I can tell you I have never cried so much in a movie ever... Being an iron man can it truly does end exactly where it begun!!! Phenomenal movie, true cinematic perfection and this movie will sweep come oscars time. But words cannot express my feelings! The end of an era and a movie that will top box office records for centuries to come!!! Thank you marvel, and thank you to the actors for giving the fans something to remember for a lifetime"
247,"Unfortunately clumsy. I enjoyed all previous Avengers, and a few scenes in this are very cool and funny, but this one lowers the bar overall. For me the story petered out instead of maintained momentum from previous movies. The dialogue struggles to be interesting, boring sequences at time.[換行字元][換行字元]Clumsy Avengers fit awkwardly together for group photo, like bad high school reunion. That said, I enjoy Avengers like everyone else for years, just not this one so much.[換行字元][換行字元]The super-power woman, Capt Marvel, her powers are overdone. Too simplistic, too much power. No reason for her to lose any fight.[換行字元][換行字元]Was a big collective of all heroes even necessary? Sort of not really.[換行字元][換行字元]Some scenes linger way too long, drawing out already thin content. And where was Dr Strange? He hardly had anything to say, and very brief appearance, yet he was in possession of crucial aspect of story."
248,For me Endgame was emotional saga and the journey of our generation came to and end and yes it was not action packed as Infinity War but I feel every violence comes to and end with piece and the ENDGAME could not have better journey then to have established the storyline the way they did.
249,"Several of the narrative problems that are present in Infinity War are not resolved or made worse by this remarkably lazy film. Of note, Thanos' ideology is both utterly incoherent and utterly alien to the Zeitgeist. The writers simply lacked the courage to make Thanos into the eugenicist that he so clearly should be. Without that edge to him he is a scene chewing comic book *villain* in the worse way. I simply did not care about the plot because the villain is a snidely whiplash joke. The film doubles down on the idiocy present in Infinity War as Thanos' end goal is just more so. This problem renders the film hollow, emotionally inert.[換行字元][換行字元]That might have been overlooked if the film's overall structure wasn't, more or less, identical to Infinity War. Starting at about 30 minutes in the two films run remarkably in parallel with each other. The pieces are slightly jumbled and certain characters end up playing different beats but act to act, sequence to sequence, scene to scene the underlying scaffolding of the plot is the same. This would be better if the plotting wasn't redundant in the first place. Infinity War boiled down to 6 color coded chase scenes over MacGruffins. The same is true in Endgame but even more so. The plot device introduced to allow the team a fighting chance produces whole manners of plot contrivances, incoherence and murky what the heck is happening. There are 21 other films in the series and while I have seen every single one (some more than 3 times!) I simply don't have the convoluted metaphysics memorized. If you saw each film once in the theatre as they were released parts of this mess will confuse you.[換行字元][換行字元]On that note the Infinity Stones are even more MacGruffins in this film as Endgame doesn't even bother to try to visualize their various powers. Infinity War turned magick users into mere boxers and this film continues to lower the bar for imaginative use of space magick. I still don't understand what the difference between, say, the space stone and reality stone is practically. There is nothing in the film that demonstrates their powers. This adds to the rote laziness that the film embodies.[換行字元][換行字元]Inevitably in a film like this a few characters will get short changed. This happened here to my favorite character. For a film that so copied its predecessor's structure I am gobsmacked that not all re-matches occurred in the action scenes. Some of them do, but a pretty obvious and possibly entertaining one doesn't. On top of that the final moment-key to a character and the plot- is overly telegraphed due to the extraordinary amount of time spent with said character and the seeming checklist they have for a farewell tour. The balance is wrong for the character relationships. You can more or less guess the consequences based on screen time.[換行字元][換行字元]None of the consequences of the two films seem final, abet textually a few of them are (I guess). Capital being what it is Disney would never kill off a bunch of Golden Geese; it was always faintly absurd the two films pretended otherwise. This narrative holdover from Infinity War takes a lot of heat out of the film.[換行字元][換行字元]There are a few nice quips. There are also some promising team up moments in the film that point to brighter days. But in the end this is navel gazing nonsense."
250,And Marvel does it again. Endgame is an almost perfect movie. I've watched it so many times I lost count.
251,"That was the fantastic , amazing movie of their time"
252,They ended and brought 22 movies together perfectly
253,"Massive in scale. Emotional. Pays homage to almost every single detail in this ever growing franchise and opens up a great future for the next decade (or more) to come. But is not perfect in any way. It has its problems and conveniences, is a little bit predictable, and some things might be considered controversial to some people. One thing is clear with Avengers: Endgame. Is not the best Marvel movie ever (sorry fanboys, I don't agree with that) but is the most Marvel-est movie (if that makes sense), and that is all it needs to be a very great and enjoyable movie. VERY GOOD."
254,Thor is spoiled in this movie.captain America is playing with Thor's hammer is likely very funny. Thanos performance is very powerful.storyline is also average.....when you going to theatre not excepted very much.
255,"Pride of MARVEL ... thanks you Russo brothers for such great MCU ending, brilliant events and twist"
256,"Movie has a little bit too much comedy. I wish it kept the dark and serious tone throughout the film. Anyways, don't go in expecting a lot of action though. Doesn't really have action until the final 45 minutes. Movie is a mix of Inception, Back to the Future, and Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]It is a little bit too long though, and the first 40+ minutes were pretty slow. 8/10"
257,This is all you want after 11 years everything in this movie is almost perfect( except time traveling) bt finally tanks Russo Brothers and farewell
258,"The Russo brother did it! They gave a majestic conclusion to a tuli marvelous saga. I have never cried so many times in a movie and my body gave me a new ""feeling"": at one very cool moment of the movie my body just... shook. I was amazed of how much they could cover in ""just"" 3 hours and it surely didn't feel that long. Things I wanted to happen, happened better I hoped. I am just very happy for this movie, it is now my favorite movie of all time and I can't wait to see it again!"
259,"DISCLAIMER- This is a spoiler FREE review[換行字元][換行字元]Well, here we are.[換行字元][換行字元]After 11 year's of top quality entertainment and planning that started all the way back with 2008's surprise smash hit Iron Man (do you feel old yet? I sure do), this part of Marvel's world domination comes to an end with what's likely to be one of, if not the biggest film's of all time, The Avengers: Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]It's a somewhat odd, occasionally emotional and fitting experience sitting back and concluding this part of the Marvel universe and while we know there's countless more Marvel film's coming our way, Endgame really does feel like the culmination of year's of hard work and adventures, that while not perfect, feels like a fitting tribute to what's come before and what still lays ahead.[換行字元][換行字元]It's incredibly hard to talk about Endgame in depth without ruining the narrative the Russo brother's and their team have created but suffice to say the creative minds behind the scenes have given us another top quality piece of blockbuster filmmaking, that's likely to please diehard fans and more casual cinemagoers alike, the only problem is, when compared to it's genuinely surprising and perfectly paced predecessor, Endgame does feel slightly more formulaic and long in the tooth.[換行字元][換行字元]It's picky for sure, but Infinity War gave us a Marvel experience that was unexpected, hilarious, emotional and epic and while Endgame has this in parts, it's not as all encompassing as last year's experience, even if by the rulebook, this was never going to be the case when tying up so many loose ends and finalising so much of what has come before it over the year's.[換行字元][換行字元]A lot of these endings and plot tie ups will please those that have invested so much into a series that has been operating on an extremely high level for a number of year's, it's just that Marvel almost outdid themselves in Infinity War, making the more by the numbers plot threads and leaps of logic found in Endgame more highlighted than usual.[換行字元][換行字元]The other minor nitpick with the film is Endgames much talked about epic 3 hour runtime and while the film starts with some unexpected and emotionally charged instances, there's a clear late beginning and middle section of the film that at times drags and cover's similar ground one too many times, even if by relative terms, the runtime in the Russo's film never is too detrimental to the fun to be had.[換行字元][換行字元]This fun comes in many forms, with particular highlights being Thor's new found lifestyle, the Hulk's more prominent role and Captain Marvel's addition to the Avengers family, while the films big action scenes (that must be said aren't that abundant) are a sight to behold, with Marvel once more showing off their ability to handle spectacles as good as, if not better than, everyone else.[換行字元][換行字元]At the end of the day, it's been an incredible period for Marvel, with arguably no outright failures and an abundance of big winners, we've been spoilt for 11 straight year's and while Endgame may not be the best of the best, it's still a mighty fine and emotionally charged finale that does the beloved cinematic universe proud.[換行字元][換行字元]Final Say -[換行字元][換行字元]While not as surprising or even as Infinty War, Endgame is still a top quality and fitting end to so much good work that's come before it and while it's sad to say goodbye to this particular era, it's exciting to see what lays in store for Marvel moving ahead.[換行字元][換行字元]4 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches out of 5"
260,"7.2/10 👍🍿 I admit, this movie was good. I didn't like infinity War but this was an improvement on both Sadness and characters. Black Widow and Hawkeye were much better in this than any other film!"

262,From Iron Man to Endgame I've seen them all and for me this was the best one because it completed everything. I loved every minute of it and I'm gonna miss seeing all those guys together. The movie was amazing There were sad parts and funny parts and I enjoyed them all.
263,This movie is amazing and deserves as much love as it gets 10 out of ten.
264,"Amazing film, a roller-coaster of emotions too just brilliant."
265,"You have to keep the ball rolling. Thor, rocket, Hulk and Captain were great but the rest were definitely not. Expected a lot more of Thanos than they showed. An anti-climax of epic proportions. Wasted a lot of time on story than strategy. Expected more.. a lot more."
266,I walked into the theater buying snacks for supposed to be the biggest hit of the spring well i must say i did not expect much however what i got was stupendous so so good loads of laughs action and adventure so much fun i do not recoomend taking the youngest of kids and also as this is a long movie if your theater lets you refill your snacks then you should do so
267,Greatest action movie of all time. Definately a must watch
268,Really good first half. Dreadful second half. Really boring. About 50% as good as infinity war. Very disappointing
269,Amazing movie 10/10 would watch again ending was sad tho
270,"Watched all MCU Movies. Started with Iron Man since 2008 and now we are here in 2019 with Avengers: Endgame. Hats off to Russo Brothers and allot of ton of thanks to all Cast & Crews, who actually did very hard works and made this wonderful masterpiece.

We all screamed out loud and cheering as well.[換行字元][換行字元]Very well balanced the whole plot and you guys need to watch all previous MCU Movies to clearly understand this Endgame!!

271,"Before you embark on a journey to watch this way-too-long movie remember that the time spent doing this cannot be recovered. You will not be able to go back in time and undo this. Thor is, as always, well played and funny. Hulk is pretty decent and that's about it. Story is not interesting at all. Too many pointless dialogues that go on and on with no message whatsoever. The main idea behind the movie seems to be to let the guys do something, pack as many faces on screen as we can and, as long as there are explosions and some colorful CGI, it will be fine. There is no depth, no cohesion to the story. I stopped watching it at 2h 15 min trying to save 45 minutes of my life."
272,"The best movie I've ever watched.marvel keep our doing themselves, it's extremely clever and amazing to watch. Left mind blown and amazed. Amazing acting and beautiful scenes created. Very emotional and exciting at the same time. Gave me goosebumps"

274,So many goosebumps mass marana mass vera level no words to say
275,Great expectations.. But just a good film. And a very bad new hero the fu..king captain marvel.
276,This movie is made for fans who have stayed on this mcu journey!!!!
277,"Simply awesome ! A perfect movie ! Thrilling , emotional with the best fight scene you will ever see ! A MUST WATCH for EVERYONE ! I love it ! BEST MOVIE EVER !"
278,Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
279,"Just when all the fans and critics think Marvel can't make any better film than Infinity War, they prove us all wrong with this amazing flick. The 3rd act is absolute feast and do watch it in IMAX 3D. All the characters were extremely well written & performed. I literally cried in atleast 14 scenes. It was so emotional in some scenes. Do yourself a favour, and watch all of the 21 movies before to feel the emotional quotient."
280,"Basically, a clip-show. The writing is uncharacteristically sub-par. The whole endeavor is uncharacteristically formulaic. The actors turn in their usual grade-A performances, but deadened by a dead script. Too many elements are gratuitous. If you're new to the franchise, don't judge it by this; if you've been with it for the whole ride--but remain somewhat objective--I'm afraid you might be disappointed."
281,"I'd tell the story I saw but it was all so confusing. I can't believe how high the garbage has been rated!!! I have seen every marvel movie that has been release and watched and liked Infinity war though I thought it dragged on. No super hero movie should ever go for more than 2 hours...EVER. Now it has dawned on me that disney and the writers of this flick had nothing but cash in mind when planning these. The first Avengers was amazing, i believed that age of ultron was the forerunner for something epic with Thanos then these 2 movies were just a massive let down but it's all about cash and I took the bait. Hook, line and sinker. A final movie is supposed to give all the answers but this just gave me so many questions and left me confused and wondering whether I loved or hated it. Now it has sunk in and I gave it thoght i just hate it. Too many contradictions. Don't get me wrong. The action is good in this movie and there are parts I loved about it but the parts i hate out weighed them. Damn you Disney!!!!"
282,After very long time saw everyone shouting n clamping in theater. Watch it in IMAX or Dolby.
283,"Don't get me wrong I am a massive MCU fan however, I feel like this movie let me down. It had some great scenes between characters however, I feel that the ending could have been more satisfying."
284,"The avengers: End game movie is the worst out of all the marvel movies. With an horrible end and a bad plot. For a normal, sane person this is a too wacky movie with a lot of weird twists. The only really good thing in this movie is the avengers theme song that gives the movie a little spark in the total darkness that it is in. If you consider watching this movie DON'T."
285,Although I had high expectations for this movie. It completely satisfied my fan service needs! Nuff said!
286,"I think it's the best avengers film and Doctor Strange's return was so awesome, it's really good movie"
287,"It's everything I wanted and more from the culmination of over a decade of Marvel movies.[換行字元][換行字元]The story starts slow but it builds up to some unexpected turns and an epic climax. My eyes were glued to the canvas as the events unfolded, not wanting to miss even a moment. There's lots of character development all around. Some well known characters are portrayed in ways we've never seen them in the MCU. The dialogue was spot on, evoking a range of emotions exactly as intended. The sequences that were meant to be funny made me genuinely laugh. In contrast, dialogue and events that were meant to illicit sadness did just that. The action was exciting with a number of stand-out moments that had me at the edge of my seat.[換行字元][換行字元]Seeing every previous Marvel movie is basically a requirement to enjoy all that this movie has to offer. But it's totally worth it and it's unlike any other franchise or movie-verse both in scope and depth."
288,Perfect movie... Character growth/progression was extremely underrated per usual. Cannot believe people aren't talking more about it!
289,"Perhaps it's because Inifnity War has gathered all heroes before and linked their stories before so it doesn't feel THAT exciting anymore. Yet, it's an amazing piece of art that represents the perfect bow for Marvel's MCU"
290,"This was the end game. Beautiful, emotional, loving, lots of action, I cried, I'm sad but satisfied and super happy ❤❤❤ I dont have words to explain, well I cant explane words or no words.[換行字元][換行字元]You just have to watch it![換行字元][換行字元]You'll see for yourself It's worth it and I maybe will go 2 more times to the theatre so much did I like it. Please give them Emmy awards!"
291,"I really like this movie, I found a good plot and also a good final, yeah the people cry and more, but it is a serious movie with several elements which honored to its fans, It is indeed a super hero movie that will live in th mind of many fans"
292,Enjoy it! Such a fantastic movie. You wont know what will happen. Even though you have an idea it will not be it
293,"How can Marvel, the Russo brothers as well as the scriptwriters go from delivering the best superhero movie ever made, Avengers Infinity War, to offering such trite tosh as Endgame? I was so disappointed that I almost threw up. I suspect at the end of the day they ran out of ideas and thought its gonna be a great way to fool us fans by offering us the final movie to make an extra billion by putting together what seemed like the worst outtakes of a b unit.!"
294,"One of the greatest marvel movies I've ever seen.It's full of action,comedy and epic moments,but sometimes we can see some little mistakes.I love it,because gives a beautiful conclusion to the first part of the MCU franchise"
295,The best chapter of the whole saga. You will remember this movie forever.
296,"We have had a ten-year relationship with the MCU. It started with IRON MAN, moved on to Captain America, inserted young Spider-Man and even gave us royalty in Black Panther. So here we are ten years later ready to sit another three hours with our favorite superheroes. After speculating and scouring the internet for the clues the day has finally come. Avengers Endgame is here.[換行字元][換行字元]The question is, was it worth it? A resounding yes. This movie was thoughtful, and action-packed at the same time.[換行字元][換行字元]It opens with our remaining Avengers trying to resolute what just happened. One would think that the Russo Brothers would give us a movie filled with Sadness and Revenge, but that's not the case here. Thor still gives us strength and humor. Cap gives us optimism and Tony aka Iron Man finally figures out what's important to him. Dr. Banner/Hulk is still a mystery however Black Widow gives us a little vulnerability.[換行字元][換行字元]Where does Captain Marvel fit, and will they ever find the other Avengers all those questions get answered?[換行字元][換行字元]Some things to be aware of, the first half of the movie takes a slower pace. It allows the surviving Avengers to grieve. Also, the reintroduction of Ant-Man and Arrow are handled smoothly.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie is an emotional rollercoaster at times. This movie is for us die-hard Marvel fans. The ones that grew up reading the comic books and binged watched all the other films in the MCU getting ready for this,[換行字元][換行字元]We're going to say goodbye to some favorites but not before we are treated to epic battles and friendships are mended.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers, Endgame is everything we want from Marvel and more. One last Cameo from Stan Lee and one last time our Avengers face down evil. The three hours are going to fly by and leave us a little sad, but Endgame gives us a fitting ending.[換行字元][換行字元]Scale: I give this movie a nine. Good things do come to those that wait.[換行字元][換行字元]Diversity: It gets 8.5 superheroes do all come in different shapes and color."
297,"Since the very first Iron Man, every thing came to this. Imagine every feeling from all these movies in just one movie. This is without doubt the most completed movie I have ever seen."
298,"I honestly don't understand what people liked in this movie. There was too much inspiration from a third class chick flick, with completely useless emotional scenes from super heros who don't really inspire any emotions. Acting and dialogs were also terribly executed. The movie could have easily be completed in half an hour without losing any content."
299,"I'm not an old Marvel guy. My interest turned up last year only and that was so high that I went for Avengers Infinity War on the very first day of release. I loved the movie and the wait for the next installment started that day itself. Every Marvel Guy would agree that this wait was very long. But. But. But. The EndGame is 101% worth the wait. I'll not go very much into details because it is just a day old in the theatres here in India. The movie though was actually a bit comical in the beginning and towards the middle. Seriousness started to rise towards the end, with the last 30 or so minutes being the best, best, best part of the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. People who have seen the movie might agree that some of the main characters were given less screentime. Not comparing to anyone but some appreciable characters had less screentime. But what matters more is how well they did their part in those minutes. In the end they all are heroes! One disappointment though was the lack of credit scenes. Every fan was expecting a glimpse of the next phase of the Superhero Universe. Nonetheless it is a great movie. A worthy one. Everyone should watch it once. *I have an opinion though. There were numerous fan theories about the movie. I think Marvel Studios should atleast make an animated series of the good ones."
300,"For a movie bursting with action and culminating in a one-for-the-time capsule showdown, Endgame starts on a quietly reflective note. No Avenger is left unbroken by the devastation that ensued when Thanos snapped his fingers and half the world turned to dust. The movie jumps ahead five years after that moment, with our superheroes are empty shells forced to reflect on their failures. Iron Man has retreated into the family life with wife Pepper Potts. Thor has lost his home on Asgard. Hulk has learned to subdue his baser instincts. And Black Widow wonders if any sense can be made of it all. That's when Ant-Man shows up, fresh from the Quantum Realm. It is willing and able to make its own, with Back to the Future coming in for a serious scene. That's so I recommend this film to everyone don't watch people."
301,Words can't describe the feeling! Movie of the century!
302,"Perfect culmination of 11 years of 22 movies in a truly epic movie universe - MCU. After success of Infinity War expetactions for Endgame were very high and there wasn't surprise factor and Marvel srudios managed to pull it out. After IW there were million of questions in the air and this movie answered it all. We all can't get what we want from the ending (for example GoT finale) but for Endgame this wasn't the ending we need but the one we deserve. Every character got enough screen time, expect for Captain Marvel who was hyped for much more, but for sure she had important role and Brie Larson performance before she even knew how her character should do is truly what deserves round of applause. Hulk and Thor characters recieved some backflash from fans but I am very happy to see comic adaptationa of Professor Hulk and King Thor personas. Robert Downey Jr. delivered best performance of his career. There were deep scenes, scenes that left me crying out loud in the cinema, laughing out loud etc. Comedy and tragedy were very well combined and in balance - as all thing should be. Also there were some minor moments that set up the Phase 4 for MCU. Fan service was enjoyable. CGI was amazing and final battle was deserving to be compared to th LotR battle scenes. Plot was amazingly well adjusted, some fans didn't like time travel definition i believe because they didn't understand it, but it is not very hard to understand just pay attention. Also time travel is just a fiction so they can make as many rules as they want. It is a pure 10!"
303,A great reward for all the previous films and is a true testament to the great MCU
304,"I wish the action / fight scenes were longer - explanations on ""time-machine"" would've been more profound. More of the bonding sessions - our Heroes long talks and walking down memory lane, I am very fond of this. Nevertheless, Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have crafted a well-paced, character-driven movie event. It will give you goosebumps, holding back any form of excitement or despair, and if you're a Marvel fan you will be geeking out over all the references to iconic comic book moments in there.[換行字元][換行字元]Btw... What happened to Loki when he was caught and then managed to get hold of the Tesseract? Or did Capt and IronM go waaay back in time to retrieve it-again? And Oh that All-Female superhero scene! - heading towards enemies (she's not by herself) seemed a lil cheesy for me... Catwalk here and single ladies there LoL - How come our human heroes can breathe on another planet???[換行字元][換行字元]Hulk's change of personality was not appealing for his character. Neither was Thor's. Was is a cute-funny thing they were going for? I believe it would have been hilarious if Hulk were to be his angry self and Thor remains the insecure yet masculine God. Viewers may not like Thor's new look, but he needed to be physically 'different' to tone down his Hotness![換行字元][換行字元]Perhaps every confusing bit and unsettling views from everyone for this movie would encourage another finaleee.[換行字元][換行字元]AE did not feel like a 3 hours movie at all - Not when you've already invested so much emotion and care into these characters. Thank you so much for a great storyline and performance. Thank you to the writers and artists who were involved in this movie! Almost a perfect wrap up =)"
305,"What's this dribble, there's about 30 minutes of action and it's a predictable boring at that and overall mind numbing silly movie , all but this one are okay , what agenda are the feminists pushing as they try going woke and ending up broke. Shame ,hope you downloaded it and were not shammed out of any money to watch..."

310,This masterpiece needs no words.[換行字元][換行字元]Let's go to the next phase
311,"Rarely you get to see a movie that makes you feel all of these emotions throughout the movie .If you are a Marvel fan you will be amazed of what the Russos have in store. The epic , satisfying ending of the ""Infinity Saga"" . Very excited to see what Marvel has in store for Phase 4 ."
312,The best movie ever!!!!!! So have I have no words. It's so amazing. Great special effects.
313,"If you're reading this, go watch the movie (again)."
314,The genre has been completed. It was the best superhero film ever. It completed an epic journey of superhero films.
315,"Left me shocked despite the theories building up to the film. I'm mentally exhausted from watching it but my god, they definitely end on a high! I couldn't have asked for a better ending."
316,I love this movie and it feels like the perfect conclusion to the infinity saga. I honestly would not have it done any other way.
317,Fantastic story..my mind blowed out..Admirable movie and character and also story..
318,"I usually don't cry for movies. Even if I cry, it's only one or two tears. But this time around I cried a lot. Even if the movie was heartbreaking, it was nothing short of a masterpiece. Everything was perfect with this movie. To call this a movie would be a disservice. It's an experience. So go experience it in theatres. This movie and the MCU will always hold a special place in my heart. Thanks Marvel for giving me and many others a wonderful childhood throughout your movies."
319,"If a couple you know, having lived together for eleven years, decide to hold a huge wedding, spare no expense, and invite everyone they know, the net effect would be a lot like Avengers Endgame: several hours of your life you feel you'll never get back, and the one thing everyone agrees on is, thank god it's over. I write this as someone who was a Marvel fan for a few years in the sixties, when these characters appeared only on the printed page. Then I forgot about the characters for thirty years, and came back to them when I had kids and we watched Marvel shows together: first the 1990s animated series, then the films beginning with the first X-Men in 2000. From those first films, the Marvel franchise has been in the hands of skilled writers and directors who take the art seriously - very seriously. The current MCU, however, starting with 2008's Iron Man, peaked after a few years with the first two Captain America films, and 2012's The Avengers. After that, the seeming need to expand the universe led to increasingly messier films, making superstars out of all of its lead actors while squeezing them into less and less screen time; bit players in their own movies. Last year's Avengers: Infinity War, merging all existing Avengers with the intergalactic storylines of the Guardians of the Galaxy was bad enough, but Endgame outdoes it in terms of taking a modestly priced and scaled, mildly subversive art form (the comic book) and turning it into an extravagantly budgeted, exhausting mess (the Hollywood blockbuster). The result is that although the climax of Endgame, bringing in almost every character who's appeared in the films since 2008, is pitched for thrills, the effect is the opposite. The return of all the heroes who disintegrated at the end of Infinity War is supposed to make us cheer, but it's as tiresome as the last drunken dinner speech at the aforementioned wedding. ""Really? I was hoping I could go home. Can't anyone shut him up?"" The skills that go into these films are undeniable, but there seems to be a tipping point past which plotting this many characters becomes a matter of chance and luck. As the films grow from one super-hero against one-supervillain (Iron Man; Captain America the First Avenger) to two or three super-heroes against a larger force (Iron Man II; Captain America the Winter Soldier) to a veritable platoon of super-heroes against armies of robots/aliens/bad guys, the limits are passed. Even an expert like Joss Whedon couldn't stop Avengers: Age of Ultron from running out of steam like a badly timed fireworks display. Nevertheless, partly through their quality casts, the appeal of the films grows: like a dry spell in the episodes of a soap opera, the audiences keep watching because they've bonded with the characters and will stick with them, hoping that eventually the relationship will get better. But a soap opera ain't the opera, and Endgame suffers from the blockbuster syndrome of giving the viewer too much of everything and not enough of anything. ""Angry and wanting more"" I think Pauline Kael called the Hollywood blockbuster, but in the case of Avengers: Endgame we can amend this to ""angry and wanting less."""
320,"Not perfect. This is a long movie and some parts of it made me feel tired. This is unescapable in a movie this long. Some really big plotholes happened in movie that totally disturb me although pretty sure many people didnt care. In the end some scenes were really emotional, main focus was the original Avengers(which is what should happened in Infinity War too). Movie had lots of great moments and a perfect ending. But all the greatness and epic feel is due to this being the last avengers movie and it gets 8 point because of that. Plot itself wasnt that incredible to give it a 9. But you wouldnt question a person if he told you that the final battle of the movie is the best battle cinema history. They really delivered there."
321,I can't be bothered to write a whole review of it but my point is in the title avengers endgame is my favourite film
322,"Believe me, in 3 hours I didn't blink my eye. There are few visual glitches despite story telling, direction and everything that give you full 3000 times satisfaction."
323,"I might be going a little bit too far by saying this but this might be my favorite movie ever. It's all personal opinion of course but I grew up with the mcu and seeing the conclusion of 22 films really made me feel all warm inside, it brought back memories of seeing the first Avengers movie or hell even seeing the first Iron Man. The payoffs are fantastic and it wraps everything up nicely. Overall I'm impressed that marvel can make this big of a movie and not have it fall flat on its face."
324,"Ohh God... can't trust to my eyes! MCU directors are fricking genius!!! They gave fans what they want with their option of ending. Real MCU fans'll realize how hard they tried to make a masterpiece!! You'll understand the true power, emotions, feelings of the characters... Be prepared for what you're not expecting! Thank you guys for the greatest job...😊👍🏼"
325,"Let's be honest since the first glance at the sprout of the MCU in the form of Iron Man we knew that it would be one of the finest additions to the garden of cinematography. And through the span of time vines, stems and buds just kept pleasing the eye, there were some deviations but the wild growth just kept on bringing the bean stalk to the castle up in the skies.[換行字元][換行字元]However, as soon as you start something like the Avengers initiative you doom yourself to a big finale, especially after mind-bending preparation provided by Infinity War. The abundance of trailers and peeks heated the desire to watch like a blowtorch a pot of crème, to the point that it almost turned to ashes.[換行字元][換行字元]It takes a master to wrap up the story like this and that will take a lot of time - which it did - 3 hours of what I expected to be the greatest part, a beautiful blossom of Marvel. Going straight to the point, there were moments when I was looking at the wristwatch thinking that those hours are up, but the show just went on. The feeling of stretching never left, it was just numbed by some exquisite moments.[換行字元][換行字元]I would say that the story continued the past well, but the insertions of jokes and puns, especially pop culture felt off and showed a real cheap price. I admire the fun style of Marvel but in the end it seemed holding together like a craft of a 6 year-old child learning how to glue things together.[換行字元][換行字元]The major problem was that there were too many things to finalize and too many loose ends to tie. And then the creators opened the door that has left more questions that it should have, giving me disappointment that was gradually covered with fascination along the way. Spoilers aside, you shall know that without remembering previous parts you might miss the opportunity of total geek freak-out.[換行字元][換行字元]Finally, a point on the action, which is another hallmark of Marvel: Endgame has put the boot on all the sense and pushed on the visuals, scale and content itself. You just look from side to side, saying your wows, not even understanding what's happening and then come the moments for which you were hoping all time long, the ones that make you cheer and be genuinely happy for the characters.[換行字元][換行字元]Trying to keep up with the weight of the moment, I would say that in the end my expectations were not fulfilled to the full extent. Sure, I've spent a hilarious time, I've had tears in my eyes, I've almost peed my pants from excitement but the amount of good stuff has been lost in those three hours. Maybe it was because the high standards put in place by the Infinity War, or the pressure of the occasion, but I believe there is no excuse for ending the entire era like this. It is worth watching with friends to discuss and enjoy the ride but checking it out for the second time is not the thing that I would pick sober."
326,The Rose brother do a film with consciousness and give a last assemble of the original Avengers a meaning
327,"I'll try to avoid many in the way of spoilers here. The movie stands well enough on its own two feet. It is a long movie, but about half of it tells its own story in and of itself, picking up where Avengers Infinity War (2018) cliff hanger left off, the other half saluting the franchise in a hat tip that I think is about as fitting a farewell as any you will find in cinema these days. Social engineering agendas aside, I will credit the makers this much: classy![換行字元][換行字元]If you have not followed the franchise for any length of time, never mind from the opening Incredible Hulk and Iron Man installments, there are a plethora of hat tips, teasers you might say, to whet your appetite. Even the most recent addition to the MCU, Captain Marvel, had its share of hat tip teasers, including its post-credits scene. Those moments will probably mean more to you, however, if you have followed the franchise.[換行字元][換行字元]There are a handful of story arcs they could probably develop more, Spider-Man, for instance, perhaps even Capt. Mar-vel. But as franchises go, this was a strong ending to a fairly well stitched together set of interwoven story lines. You will not find any post-credits scenes here. I find it a little bittersweet, but like I said, those hat tips, in-credits acknowledgements, are the post-credits scenes, I think. More salutations for the folks who helped make it such a great franchise.[換行字元][換行字元]Now if only much of the work generated by the franchise went to U.S. citizenry, but we will not go there for purposes of this review."
328,"A movie with lot of fun,lot of action and extremely emotional rollercoster.So if you got a chance, go to the theatre and watch it because the movie must watch."
329,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. I enjoyed it more than any other MCU movie I have ever watched, or any other ""superhero movie"" I have ever watched (and boy I have watched A LOT of those). If I could describe the movie in a few words I woul just have to say ""the good, the bad and the ugly"", and the reason for that is because throughout this masterpiece you get to see it all, and when I say all, i mean absolutely everything you could expect from all the MCU movies and so much more. We get to see our hero's win, lose and do things you will never expect. The only reason I didn't give this 10 stars is because although the movie is as good as it can possibly get, it has some little problems and tiny little plot holes that add up together to take one star down. Some things don't make total sense, but I guess if a talking racoon/rabbit is ok then I am fine. The one thing that I love about the movie is how simple yet complex and surprising it is. The main storyline is exactly what you would expect, but some how the movie still manages be so interesting and unexpected, and guys I didn't even talk about the final third of the movie which is the best thing I have ever seen on a movie screen in my life. In conclusion, this movie is fantastic. Go see it now! But before you do you need to understand three main things. One. It is freaking three hours! Go to the bathroom before! Two, it is connected to all of the other MCU films, so before you watch this make sure to watch the rest of them before. This way you will not only understand endgame better, but the entire MCU better. And three. It is very complex. A lot of things are going to happen at the same time, so don't even blink and listen carefully. It is so so so so worth it"
330,It's a Masterpiece ![換行字元][換行字元]The end of an Era ![換行字元][換行字元]Thank's for MCU !
331,"After waiting for a year, Avengers: Endgame hit the theatres and shattered a number of box office records worldwide. But, was it really so perfectly great? No.[換行字元][換行字元]Good : The first thing I loved about this movie was that it was the most character driven film in the MCU till date. In particular, Hawkeye and Black Widow got the most of character shine. And, it didn't have much of Captain Marvel. As someone who feels awkward when she comes on screen, it was a good thing. It did a great job of serving the fans. So many crowd pleasing moments! I was literally jumping and whistling when I was watching this film, literally. The third act is full of those moments. Those moments do come along with really good character background, a story and excitement. All of these do not make complete sense, but at least they weren't blant. And, many parts are quite nostalgic. It has tried it's best to give every character a proper arc. Performances are incredible. I didn't even hate Don Cheadle in this movie. On the whole, it was insanely entertaining and has ridiculous amount of great moments to say the least.[換行字元][換行字元]Mixed : It's not a spoiler to say it's a time travel film. While this plot device served a lot to give us a lot of crowd pleasing moments, each of which I really loved, the whole time travel part could've been even more epic and exciting than it was. There were parts in Infinity War where it jumped from plotline to plotline. This one does the same, but it looked more choppy here. Not necessarily a bad thing, a movie of this scale would have such problems. But it was a bit more distracting than before. I admit I liked many arcs given to the characters. But, they were still a bit illogical, in particular that of Steve Rogers. Many things were entertaining as hell, but still quite paradoxical.[換行字元][換行字元]Bad : It's a time travel movie. It generates a lot many plot holes and inconsistencies. It uses time travel as an excuse for getting certain things done. It has the most generic issues of a non sci-fi time travel movie. The timeline surely is messed up now. I don't know how the time travel in this universe works and how certain things were amended due to all of these time travelling stuffs. May be I will never know. And Thanos. He was treated more like a mustache twirling villain, rather than how he was in Infinity War. The way his character ended was the most disappointing part of the movie. It feels as if it tries to be as big as Infinity War while it clearly isn't.[換行字元][換行字元]Conclusion : You can and must watch this film. It's a film by the Russo Brothers, you can definitely count on them for an entertaining film, but this is perhaps their weakest film in the MCU. It isn't well paced as Infinity War is, but still gives all the moments you can wish for. Infinity War is a whole lot better than this film, but is still a worth watching flick. If you stop thinking about the inconsistencies time travel creates in this film, this will be a much better experience.[換行字元][換行字元]Rating.[換行字元][換行字元]Score : 8.9/10[換行字元][換行字元]Grade : A"

333,"I rarely take my time to write reviews, but this movie, even as a solo film, it was astonishing! For the fans, It concludes the saga of 22 movies and even though, this isn't the last of phase 3, It sure is for our hearts. The movie starts of slow, but with each second passing, you are eager to see what's going to happen. The movie haves both funny and sad sections. Though, it still gives you several questions to ask after the end, it concludes many of the story arcs.[換行字元][換行字元]Also, in the small city I live in, this was the 1st time I've seen so much people in the cinema. There were several times the crowd cheered, applaud, even cried. Never have I seen such reactions from a crowd, this alone can tell you that this is, if not the best (superhero) movie you've seen, then one of the best.[換行字元][換行字元]I do strongly recommend to watch the movie as soon as possible, because some people are already spoiling it.

335,"This movie was freakin awesome!!!!! I can't believe it was 3 hours long. The story was so good that it went by fast. It had a little bit of everything. I gotta see it again and I need it as soon as it's available to purchase. If you haven't watched all of the past Marvel films, do that first so you're not lost but I promise you will enjoy this film either way."

338,"NO SPOILERS AHEAD, just an honest review from someone who makes a living working in the film and television industry.[換行字元][換行字元]ENDGAME had a daunting task of following up arguably the greatest MCU film of all time so I can appreciate the Russo's even attempting it but that being said this film's master plan was poorly executed. Ranging from poor character development to lazy writing along with multiple plot holes and obvious continuity errors that should not have gone unnoticed (shame on you, scripty) the film was just..... A let down. A tremendous let down.[換行字元][換行字元]Things to do instead of watch this movie: 1.) Rearrange your sock drawer 2.) Call that aunt that used to gift you batteries as a kid but no toys to put them in 3.) Mow your lawn. Even if it's freshly cut you would still be better off mowing it again than going to see this nonsense."
339,Not enough Action to justify the final battle.. Really... being the End of an Era... lifetime movie... come on.. Infinity war has an 9 pointer from me but this endgame... I don't know... just a bit disappointing in the action department. No Thrill at all. I guess a few folks are right... Fan service Movie...
340,"Too many endings and too much focus on the showdown, but of course we enjoyed every second."

They begin their journey as a Hero , they get a mission , they fight for it & Wins it & establishes themselves as a Star . But what Endgame will provide you , is something very different you expect from a Superhero Movie . They made the movie that will touch every part of your SOUL , even if you are not a MCU FAN . The Bigger story gives us a Roller-coaster ride in everyway possible in terms of Emotion , Humour , Adventure , Action , Mind Bloggling VFX , Twists . GO FOR THE MOVIE , I ENSURE YOU - THESE 3 HOURS WILL BE ONE OF THE GREATEST OF YOUR LIFE ❤ ! & Yes , Better go for A 3D Show ;)"

344,"WARNING: this review, like others, may give you a bias when watching the movie. Please keep in mind that this is mostly my opinion.[換行字元][換行字元]From the end of 'Avengers: Infinity War' I have felt as though the story was incomplete, as though the movie ended before the climax. But I guess that was the point. Because Endgame is the climax, the finale, the ultimate conclusion.[換行字元][換行字元]The opening few minutes were ingenious for building on the concept of how impactful Thanos' actions were. Someone must have cried in that scene. I can't say I saw what was coming in the next, maybe, 20 minutes.[換行字元][換行字元]Moreover, it was even harder to think of what could possibly come AFTER those 20 minutes. But I suppose with the Infinity Gauntlet about, there's no telling what will happen, which kills the sense of wonder in this Marvel universe. Besides these 20 minutes, I was not that impressed by the remaining first half of the movie, but boy, did the last half pay off! Movies like this make me wonder if cinematography can get any better (for example, the opening scene of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice).[換行字元][換行字元]I am not a huge Marvel fan, so I won't be able to notice all of the inconsistencies that this movie apparently has with the first movie (according to several fans I know), but I am confident that Marvel Studios has the answers. I always did like the first The Avengers movie, by the way.[換行字元][換行字元]I don't like what happened to Thor (if you have seen the movie, then you'll know what I mean) and the Hulk thing was weird at first, but I got used to it.[換行字元][換行字元]Maybe I'm the only one who didn't find this movie ""an emotional rollercoaster"", but then again, I'm not a huge Marvel fan. Similarly, I didn't get most of the jokes even though I have seen most of the movies. Regardless, the movie sure doesn't disappoint and I liked the ending, too.[換行字元][換行字元]I primarily gave this movie a ⭐9 because of how much it stands out from the other (is it 21?) movies."
345,If you felt underwhelmed the first time. I suggest you see it again
346,"The movie wraps up everything perfectly, that was 11 years and 21 movies in the making. It's make you laugh, cry, and every other emotion you can think of. It's an end of a journey that wraps up perfectly."
347,"Having watched the entire MCU in chronological order, this made the effort all worth while. What a way to end an era."
348,"As a long-time Marvel viewer, my expectations were really high for this movie. Nevertheless, Endgame completely killed it. Great acting, awesome character development, lots of laughter and emotions and what an endig... The perfect conclusion to an era of Marvel films no fan will ever forget about. If you do a bit of nitpicking the movie can be a bit messy at times, but even this is charming. It makes you wonder if they did this on purpose to use it as a plotdevice for future films. I want to thank every actor, director, writer, ... who made these films possible. You really did brighten up many lives around the globe.[換行字元][換行字元]I love you 3000!!!!"
349,They did such a great job. I cried. Honestly I didn't mind how long it was. Honestly it could've been even longer. They could've done more with the intro but I loved it. Great end to a beautiful era. Thank you avengers.
350,"No movie is perfect, especially this one, but man! I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in a long time! So many cool moments, refrences to past movies and comics and surprisingly good comedy too. My only problem in the film was what they did to hulk, not getting the ending i would have liked and the numerous plotholes but overall the best MCU movie in my opinion. Great conclusion to an amazing saga."
351,Avengers endgame is beyond a great movie...! It is a cinematic spectacle which for anyone watching is a breathtaking experience 22 films in the making a likely experience which defines an era.
352,Never been on a theater twice where a movie moved so many people emotionally. It was the cherry on the top. Amazing just amazing. 10 of 10.
353,"Movie was everything I wanted and more. Well written story. You feel for the characters. It starts lil slow, but it make sense why. I'll be watching this movie like four times. AMAZING MOVIE!!"
354,"Such high hopes for this movie after infinity war but was such a let down. Only real action was the last hour of the movie and even then it wasn't anywhere as decent as the action in infinity war. I understand the need to bring the story to a close but it could have been done with better editing out unnecessary storyline within the 1st hour, so dragged! If it wasn't for the ending action scenes I would have given it a 5! Last 15 minutes is also slow and 15 minutes of credits (no post credit scene). So it's 2 hours 40 of the movie and approx 20 minutes credits. Compare a massive franchise like this with lots of the rings trilogy and this is not the mega finale as hoped as return of the king is a proper send off!"
355,I can't give more than 5/10 to a time travel movie that can't get time travel right.
356,"They started a series of movies 11 years ago and creatively orchestrated them to all connect together and come to an incredible, heartwarming, heart-wrenching, satisfying and very unexpected ending. Each movie hooked us in even more with every connection. You realize more during this movie than during Infinity War just how emotionally connected you are to the characters."
357,"The end of a decade of fantastic movies. No one has ever done what the MCU has managed to do. And this was a great way to Cap it off (pun inteded). I don't have to tell you all to watch this movie, you know what's good. Aside from a few scenes and premises that don't make much sense, this was a fun movie with some real tear jerker moments."

It is the best superhero movie till date , answers almost every question of each and every Marvel Fan and will give you much more than expected . It will make you go through the entire journey of all the previous marvel movies and will provide you a perfect conclusion of all the events that happened earlier . The only thing Bad about the movie is that it ended ...#snap"
361,"I must apologize to the highly intelligent, mature, and extremely loyal fans because I the average, dumb, 10 year old, who started watching marvel yesterday as suggested by other reviews, found this movie to be one of the greatest cinematic experiences. The build up was great, the nostalgia was amazing, the last act was actually the best scene I've ever witnessed and trust me I've watched hundreds if not thousands of movies. I laughed a lot even more than Ragnarok and Deadpool; I cried a lot more than anytime in the last couple of years. I watched the movie again the very next day and still experienced the same emotions. Stan would be proud. I thought to myself that the Russos wouldn't be able to ruin this movie due to the success but never in my wildest dreams did I expect them to maximize the potential of this movie exceeding my wildest expectations. Again I apologize for the intelligent haters, since you have a very high IQ and you saw everything coming, you won't be able to relate to my review about this ""lazy written"", ""fan servicing"", and ""contradicting"" movie."
362,"Never have I heard so much cheering in a movie. Also, there was a lot of tears from grown men. Not myself of course, but being a huge Marvel fan, I mostly knew what to expect. I've loved almost all of the movies leading to this, and this did them justice. Many great heartfelt moments, some good action and of course they always sneak the humor in somehow. Even my wife loved this, and she's stuck by me for most of these. I hope it breaks all the records, and I can't wait to see what direction Marvel goes next with whoever that may be."
363,Without the credits. The movie is 2 hours and 40 mins. The movie is boring at the start. It has a slow build up. It gets good..
364,"A really enjoyable experience! Some things you expect to happen don't and others do. Laugh out loud funny, poignant and smart with lots of Easter Eggs. The characters are well served with lots of wonderful small moments. Aspires and succeeds in entertaining and delighting the audience."
365,"The best super heroes saga to date. Even though I did not like what they did to Thor, yet the movie is a Marvel master piece. Especially for fans"
366,"Loved the last one in the series, lots of emotions, and all the action you could ask for."
367,"...What fans, both super & casual, want are provided by this movie. Threads & plotlines neatly tied up. Each character getting their time in the spotlight. Lots of laughs & chuckles - which are needed when the theme is so dark. A good amount of cries too for that matter. Action. Thought-provoking dialogue. You thought they couldn't surprise us anymore? Wrong. There's a few didn't see that coming moments - - even for me, ""Mr. I Knew That Was Going To Happen."" 3 or 4 times I got goosebumps. Although truth be told I get those just from the theme music. If they make a 4 hour super fan director's cut I'm all in. 9.5 out of 10 for me. This one has overtaken Capt. America TWS as my all-time fav MCU movie - - just not quite the fun of Thor: Ragnarok though."
368,"Shocking start and a very shocking ending according to my perspective. What to expect in this movie is lots of emotions, laughs and surprises. It's a movie to remember"
369,"This movie is just straight fan service in my opinion, it's a fantastic payoff to the 11 years of the MCU. I think it's probably one of the best endings we could have gotten. But, there are many flaws, like the CGI. It has very good effects but it has way to much. About half of the movie is on a green screen. And I'm not exaggerating, it's definitely the most effects heavy movie in the MCU. That's just my opinion though. The acting is actually a lot better than I thought it would be and that sounds quite bad, but I was really impressed with some of the performances. Particularly from Chris Evans and Jeremy Renner. A lot more depth compared to previous movies. RDJ is great as usual but I still think his best performance is in Iron Man (2008), doesn't mean it's disappointing, just in my opinion is outshines by other strong performances. I think the length of the movie is actually good as it's never really boring or slow. I think it's probably the second best superhero movie this year, because I think Joker is amazing. But it's still a very good movie but if I was to be honest, probably a little over-hyped, I think it's because it's a fan service movie and I don't consider myself an ""MCU fanboy"", but that view can very much change depending on the viewer. But yeh, really good."
370,"This is without a doubt the best superhero movie I have seen in my life. Expectations were high going into this and this exceeded it in every way. The movie was emotional, epic and exciting. This movie was fan service at its peak. If you intend on watching this movie I urge you to stay away from spoilers and watch the previous MCU movies, it truly is a great pay off. The Russo Brothers once again deliver, and I believe this is their best work. Impeccable."
371,"The best movie I've ever seen, truly extraordinary film making. I'm late arriving into the MCU, theres still half a dozen movies I haven't seen. I'm also no Marvel aficionado.[換行字元][換行字元]Who cares? Comic book movies are supposed to be ridiculous, other-worldly, full of people with absurd abilities competing against each other. It shouldn't be this loaded with character development. Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Romanov, Ant-Man, Banner, Pepper Potts, Nebula, Hawk-Eye.....all the survivors from Infinity War have a completely unique burden to being a survivor of Thanos' 'snap'. But more than that, this one movie acts as a denouement to 21 other movies and a mass of individual storylines. In Ultron, it was a big surprise to learn that Barton is massively family-focused, but now we know that, it's no surprise whatsoever how he responds to mass extinction, basically carrying out an individualised purge against all that should have turned to dust and didn't.[換行字元][換行字元]You can comfortably know nothing about these characters, and still be a blubbering wreck. End Game is also perfectly balanced, without doubt the darkest movie in the franchise, but also the funniest. The Russo's clearly recognising that without some comic relief, the characters themselves would be overcome by anger and grief, thwarting their quest to reverse the snap.[換行字元][換行字元]It's an absolute fanboys dream, bringing back to many characters that we thought were long gone. Baffled by how well written this was. And I've not even mentioned that friggin' battle!!!"
372,I've never seen a movie like that in my life it was perfect in every way and when we talk about Oscar winning movies this better be on the ballot next year as well as the Russo brothers and Robert Downey jr. Heck the whole cast absolutely classic forget Gone With the Wind this is the greatest movie ever made.
373,Best Superhero movie of all time. Best MCU movie.It will take a long time for us fans to get along after some disheartening things happened.
374,The Best MCU film ever made. The 22nd movie of Marvel Cinemastic Universe have done loyality for all the anticipation of marvel fans. Every marvel fan will be heartbroken after seeing the movie. It is a must watch
375,"Either you are a Marvel fan or not, or maybe you are a Marvel hater (because probably you're a fan of another. Aye, that one), I highly recommend you to see this film. See the end of 11 years starry universe that made us believe everyone's a hero, at least in their own life story.[換行字元][換行字元]We all know that Infinity War, and Endgame basically, are one movie that divided into two, so literally, they have one script. I thought they would divide it into 50:50, but, I can tell you that Endgame is just a quarter of it. Legendary scenes and people everywhere. The most amazing and mesmerizing CGI works will appear in approximately the last 30 minutes; aye, that important scene. Epic scenes: checked. Surprising scenes: checked. Funny scenes: definitely checked. Warm-hearted scenes: checked multiple times.[換行字元][換行字元]I don't think the scoring has a big impact on helping to build a sad feeling; I'm not even crying. But, somehow, the Avengers' theme song sounds more glorious and that makes me feel empty, like, they're saying goodbye in the coolest way they can. So I can say, this film won't amaze your eyes like before. Your heart is their target: building an empty feeling as they walked out of the screen.[換行字元][換行字元]Can't say more. I'm afraid that I will accidentally give you ""a tea"". So, just see it yourself. See it. Whatever it takes."
376,"The movie, in my opinion, was overall a very amazing movie. The first half starts of the movie is a litlle slow pacing but the second half definitely makes up for it.[換行字元][換行字元]Some scenes in the first half were a little too long at some points. It seemed as if the first half was 2 hours and the rest was 5 minutes. If the movie was only made out of the first half, I would give it a 6/10.[換行字元][換行字元]The second half, however was EPIC. There are no words to describe how great the last fight scene was. I never remember crying because of being this excited in a scene. There are some points when everyone in the theather cried and at some points everyone was shocked.

377,"Avengers: Endgame:- A year after half the characters disappeared, we created our own endless theories and possibilities of killing Thanos. Nothing said so far, the movie turns out to be a good explanation as to how situations could change in just maybe a single possible way. This doesn't mean that the script made predictable. Well, some of it is, but the Russo brothers manages to engage the audience with awe and curiosity. This is a 3 hour long movie which has tons of emotional and heart warming scenes where the characters beautifully express their softness. Also the thought expressed while scripting these scenes is quite admirable. At some points the scenes are a little bit dragged but that's just for the viewers to enjoy their favorite character in this final project. The concepts do contradict at times and can get a little confusing. The concepts cannot be elaborated as they can be a major spoiler. A few moments in the movie were just breathtakingly awesome as it was totally unexpected. The actors have delivered their best performance in all aspects by connecting to it's viewers throughout. The MCU couldn't get a better ending to justify the events in this movie which makes it just spectacular. Experiencing and reliving what we have witnessed till today in all the Marvel movies was the main objective of the makers and they did a commendable work. It's not quite comparable, but if done in terms of entertainment, then yes, infinity war is ahead of all in this game. Nevertheless, enter the theater with all your assumptions and let's see how well you have done. Rating: 8/10"

380,"Considered as the Finale or the final chapters of the Avenger Series, it is the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is the only film of this century that has garnered such a Huge demand in domestic as well as International Markets. Fans, especially the kids and teenagers are awaiting its release with baited breathe and fortunately I was able to watch the movie couple of days earlier than the International Release.[換行字元][換行字元]The Movie is 3 hours long but believe me it is too short to cover such as vast ensemble cast and package all their stories into it within the stipulated time. I believe that the movie should have been made into two parts. Why I feel this way? Let me explain it to you. There are certain parts of the movie where you feel they are trying to build up the story and later you realize that they just dragged it and there are other scenes in the movie where you feel it is being done hastily before we the audience could sink in the gravity of the scene or the moments resulting the emotional scenes as bland. Now why would they even consider building up the story as Avengers Infinity Wars had already set the stage for the Finale? Everyone who has watched the prequel to Endgame only wants to know how these Heroes will make things right and how emotionally they have been affected.[換行字元][換行字元]If they had made it in two parts then every character would have shined like in Infinity War but here even the main characters fail to make an impact. There are jokes here and there but they aren't enough. There are too many unnecessary, silly scenes that only consume time and nothing else. I believe after watching the Endgame, every fan will agree that Infinity Wars is the best movie of the Franchise. If you recall Captain America - Civilian War then it reminds you of the brilliant action choreography because most of it is done in the daylight as against the dark creepy VFX settings like most of the other Superhero flicks. Even the Infinity War triumphs in the Grand Battle because everything was done in daylight. Those scenes looks real compared to the dark graphics. I was Very disappointed with the Finale 8 -10 mins of Grand Battle of Endgame, it was similar to Aquaman.[換行字元][換行字元]My opinion may sound bit negative but its not, you will definitely enjoy the movie and there are some good moments including is a moment where you may get heartbroken, I mean literally if you are a Marvel Fan.

Storyline not great either. Previous Avengers films much better. Such a shame. Waste of money really. Expectation I guess has earned its box office takings."
384,"Great closure, amazing movie. Just the right ending for a 22 movie saga."
385,"This was a terrible film. I rented it and feel like I wasted my money. The movie is 3 hours long. 2 of those hours is just nonsense and jabber. Then you get about thirty minutes of the big fight, followed by another thirty minutes of boredom. The male heroes are portrayed as buffoons, which is indicative of today's man-hating society. Anyone giving this film a high rating suffers from Marvel Bias Syndrome.[換行字元][換行字元]I thought the previous installment was bad. This installment lowered the bar even further. Writers are so busy pushing their man-hating agenda by making the two most powerful Avengers (Thor and Hulk) buffoons, they failed to capture the essence of the Avengers. They have devolved the franchise into an Everybody Loves Raymond-esque sitcom. However, Everybody Loves Raymond is much better written. I am glad I did not waste time and money at the theater for this joke of a movie."

The movie takes time to show us the unbearable loss of Infinity War and how the Avengers each deal with it, before a way to bring back all of the victims of the Snap appears.

387,"This movie left mr speechless. I'm not usually one to get loud in a theater but the entire auditorium was feeling everything together and you couldn't help but to react together. That's what this series did, it brought people together. It assembled us and together, we disassembled at the end as the era came to a close. It was an emotional rollercoaster that left me breathless, speechless and intensified everything. I laughed, I cried, I cheered, and I mourned but at the end I smiled. It all came together through seamless story telling and superb acting and these last ten years built the momentum to the grand Endgame and it was the perfect end to others behinnings. I have to say I loved it 3000."

390,From the starting to the end this movie was amazing. Exactly what the fans wanted to see and they got it with a satisfying ending in my opinion. One of the best Super hero movie that I have seen. Marvel have done an amazing job
391,This is an average one time watch.Not at all matching the hype caused due to tremendous success of it's predecessor movies.Average script and below par action sequences.You are better off rewatching GOT.A lot left to be desired out of this.
392,"There was an idea for the whole time that MCU never disappoints. It never did. And it dragged an end with all the emotions a person can have for love! In only 3hours,we could laugh, could cry, could scream! Every emotions at a time is quite touchy. My body still trembles with attraction. This wasn't just a movie and neither it was anything like anything. It's a legacy, it's love, it's emotion, it's everything."
393,This film has brought a lot of attention to the marvel cinematic universe even for those who dont particularly watch marvel are going to the cinema to see this film. It amazes audiences with every minute of the film. This is not a film you wanna miss.
394,Really good endgame movie of marvel but it's not their best.
395,Marvel proved me VERY wrong. It was one of the best movies I have seen in 20 years. The links to the past and the empathy of the new stories made it 3 hours of pure pleasure. I bloody loved it!
396,It missed some feather for thor. Maybe a cooking scene with Hulk. Would like to see a shower scene but just for the bubbles not for the actors. No really... was it a joke. Didn't get the buzz for this crap. Not so innocent as it seemed in its poor hidden messages anticipating the future makeover of the Marvel universe... and it's fall. Sign me out.
397,"In 3 hours (not like 3, movie isn't boring. like 2 hours) i've cried and laughed a lot. this movie is the best superhero movie ever. and i think they won't do the better than this once..."
398,"Too many jokes which make the movie very long to watch, but the end is totally worth it! Nice way to end those beautiful movies!"
399,"What a load of bs. What was this? The writers of this movie should never be given jobs again. The first two hours were a complete and total waste of time. A better story line would have made this the movie we all wanted, 2 hours long with a 45 minute fight scene. But you couldn't be bothered to do this could you? You wrote the movie YOU wanted. Not what we wanted. Screw this over-elaborate, slow moving piece of absolute garbage!"
400,"I saw this movie yesterday, and as an avid Marvel fan, I was blown away. Awesome fight scenes, remarkable special effects (as many other Marvel masterpieces have), and all-in-all just a great work of art. It made me laugh, it made me want to cheer, and it almost made me cry. It was an incredible way to conclude the past ten years of Marvel movies. I personally think that Hulk should have had more of a role/personality, and Thor should have been more of a badass, but otherwise, I loved this movie 3,000, and it was full of amazing surprises.[換行字元][換行字元]RIP Stan Lee, Marvel will never be the same without you."
401,"I am waiting for this movie from the day I watched Avengers Assemble movie in 2012... Perfect Ending.[換行字元][換行字元]There is no movie such grand in past or in recent times, not even star wars( sorry fans but its the fact). Marvel put every trick possible in this movie. I laughed, I got Thrilled and got Excited. Cried in the end and am happy while coming out of the cinema.[換行字元][換行字元]The makers tried their level best to portray such big story in 3hr time.... Even 3hrs are not enough to cover every detail, hence little flaws."
402,I'm sorry but this movie was boring except for the last part. Infinity war was well balanced and every character had a role. Also had action from beginning to end. But endgame mostly had unnecessary talks or travelling here and there. Most main characters don't even have any fight scenes. Whole movie is focused on only 2-3 characters. Rest of the characters were in it like they just have a cameo. Should have made a semi team up film after infinity war and then Endgame with all the characters having enough screentime. Wasted opportunity.
403,"Don't believe what you read when some critics tell you this movie starts slowly, it picks up right where Infinity War left off and it's opening scene reminds the viewer of the previous film's disastrous consequences. The first 15/20 minutes are able to provide an unexpected, yet very effective conclusion to the plot threads left in Infinity War, almost acting as a prelude to the events of Endgame. From then on, this is a completely different movie and it wonderfully concludes so many of the arcs from the past 11 years. The whole cast give an excellent performance with particular highlights being Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant Man. Personally, I believe this is nothing short of a perfect film, for casual viewers it serves as a fun and satisfying superhero movie, but for every Marvel fan who has become so invested into these characters it feels like an entirely deserved reward. An absolute must watch for any fans of the genre."
404,"I saw this a few days ago on opening night, and I didn't know what to think of it. After thinking about it for a few days, I've come to the conclusion that this is hands down, the best marvel movie ever made. Not just in the MCU, but marvel overall. This film has everything, hilarious moments, depressing scenes, amazing directing and fantastic writing. the characters are extremely well written, with Thor's character arc being my favorite. This film is amazing, a true work of art, and if you can see it, GO. SEE. IT."
405,"Completely shocked at how bad this is. Thought marvel did a great job with infinity war, with character development and tying the story all together.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is the exact opposite. Back to the cliche terrible jokes, no character development. Focus on the worst actors, almost no screen time for all the most talented members of the new marvel cast.[換行字元][換行字元]Back to the drawing board required for next avengers movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Genuinely awful film!! So disappointed."
406,"Dont get me wrong, i know 99% of the reviews are from marvel/avengers fans but hey im not blame you all youre are blind and marketing from producers swept you down. Let me see - opening was perfect but suddenly half of the movie is boring, cheaply dark, second part of the movie is too chaotic. Movie trashes other truly legendary films about their non logical sory but here is seemingly everything logical ? LOL ... I could name like 6 very stupid/ilogical/boring things but hey, whats the point. Im just glad all the avengers nonsense ended. I liked Infinity War for its adult-ish story, dark/serious tone, nice and attractive story but here producers knew that EVERYTHING goes and NOTHING will be criticised from die hard fans.. Even if the movie was bad in 50% of the avengers fan, still everybody from you would love it.. Producers have the luck that this franchise is very very solid in terms of acceptance.. For neutral fan like me ? theres HUGE gap between Infinity War and Endgame."
407,There was two nebula and two captain America But only one Natasha and tony stark
408,"The movie had its ups and downs, it's laughs and cries!!! By far one of my favourite MCU Films and one of the best conclusion Films ever!! It's a must see!!"
409,I never thought i ll 5 star a MCU movie... Such a disappointment. Ruinned well and long built characters. I felt like it was a movie about Captain America in the end. Thor ruinned completely. Thanos ruinned. Plot holes. Slow pace. meh battle at the end. Infinity war was epic in comparison with end game. They either tried too much or too little..
410,"It just shows the influence of media and the hype on the popularity of a movie. It was the first time, that I fell asleep watching a film in the cinema. It doesn't deserve to be among the top 250 movies of all time."
411,"Simply the greatest happening in the world of cinema / geek / nerd.[換行字元][換行字元]A work derived from a long planning, a great study and great production, gathering all these actors, tying a giant script and closing with giant surprises and golden key, is for few![換行字元][換行字元]Thank you MARVEL for inviting me to become a film industry professional, thanks to this infinity saga I chose my profession, and my reference is you, thank you!"
412,"The movie is ""okay"", but can´t reach the same intensity like Avengers: Infinity War. Sadly to say, that the production team missed the opportunity to deliver a milestone in superhero cinema. The effects and the shooting is top notch, but unfortunately that´s not all. It just looked like ""work on schedule"". So, don´t believe the media hype and don´t set your expectations too high. Entertaining? Yes... somehow if you forget about all the cringy moments! But really nothing more..."
413,"Best Super-Hero Movie of All Time![換行字元][換行字元]Yes, I've said that and I don't regret it at all![換行字元][換行字元]A Big Thank you to Marvel, the Russo Brothers, the Entire Cast and Production behind this amazing universe for making this possible.

414,An epic saga...too gud to be true... Scenes which we gonna remember all our lives
415,This was a truly amazing movie and Marvel did about as well as they possibly could have with the last movie in this phase.
416,1;2...Terrible! Scrap the whole thing...try again!
417,"Endgame has some really fun and epic moments. It also has some very emotional moments. But this movie is far from a ""love letter"" to fans of the OG6 Avengers, as some critics have claimed. Far from it. Endgame basically steamrolls over 10 years of character development for most of the OG6, especially Tony, Steve, and Thor. I was extremely disappointed with how these characters were treated, because they deserved so much better than Endgame. Instead of resolving their character arcs in a satisfying and sensical way, the Russos decided to go for meaningless shock value and ""fanservice"" that only makes sense to them (and not the majority of fandom). This is like Age of Ultron all over again, except much more depressing and upsetting. A shameful end to a wonderful saga."
418,Writting about time traveling is always difficult. But there's been so many inconsistencies in this movie that I lost Interest after 1hour watching. The writting was so poorly done that I felt no emotions and got bored at some point. Infinity war were so well done that I'm really surprised that the last Avengers movie turned down like this.
419,No amount of word could describe this work of art.
420,Everything I have been waiting for for the past 10 years and then some! Everything paid off in the final act of the movie. The greatest hour in superhero movies that will probably never happen on the big screen ever!
421,"This is the best movie i ever watch by Marvel production, i think they never gonna pass this movie. ALL RECOMMENDATION if you're fan of superheros"
422,"Endgame did a lot of great things including breaking the ""formula"" a lot of super hero movies seem to follow nowadays. This being said, it contained some awful story telling and character development.[換行字元][換行字元]The Russo brothers merely wrote out how they want the movie to end, and made a connection to the present MCU. The movie is completely plot with very little / poor relationships and character development. The gates opened in many times to have a great breaking of relationships and massive character development, but the Russo's instead took those opportunities to make action sequences rather than anything that the audience would feel for more than 3 minutes afterward, a mere portion of an over three hour movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Also, another point to note, there is a portion of a scene which scream ""women's equality"" at the viewer in the most cheesiest and cliche way which completely breaks whatever connection the viewer is currently having with the rest of the scene. The proper way to handle equality of women in movies is to just make them cool, and not overdo it to the extreme this movie demonstrated.[換行字元][換行字元]If your a fan of the MCU, definitely watch it. Otherwise I would recommend to avoid it."
423,"It's a god damn master piece, everyone need to watch this, that's the greatest MCU movie ever"
424,Doesn't measure up to Infinity wars and has too many plot holes. is not that bad but i was expecting way more than what we got is like many promises were broken on this one.
425,"This movie is realy good, but i dont think it was amazing."
426,A great movie. A must watch for marvel fans. It will take another 5-6 years to get to this hype.
427,Perfect is the only thing I can say. Could not imagine a better ending.
428,"It's the perfect conclusion to this story that began 11 years ago. An emotional sendoff to the heroes whom we grown up to. Thank you Marvel and all the actors, I can't wait to see what's coming next."
429,"I went to cinema expecting an epic conclusion of the story. What I got is a bad scripted, awful mix of characters with bland actiing (credits to some of them who were good) and half an hour worth of watching. End of it."
430,"The climax that all fans deserve. Marvel still pulls out surprises that you couldn't dream of, allowing this to earn a spot anongst some of the greatest films made. The length yields an utterly satisfying scene, but honours the 11 years of the studio with the perfect ending."
431,"Wonderful ending for 22 movies. Every characters showed a great balance grow up with us. The 1st avengers showed how to find the main 6 characters, the end game also end with how to find the main 6 characters with Giant ending."
432,Such an amazing end. Perfect in nearly every way! A must see for any comic book fan!
433,Biar bintang yang berbicara (udh kaya gojek aja) WKWKKWKWKWKWKWKKKWKWKWKWKKWKWKWK
434,Its amzing i love it cuz it's the end 10 years and 22 moves am watch the first movie when I 9 years old and now I'm 18 when when I watched this movie I feel I'm back to my childhood Iron Man rest in peace you are the start and you are the end
435,All I can say is that everything that you want to happen happens but there is also things that I didn't expect to happen but all good things. Simply this is a fitting end to the saga 10/10!!!!
436,Awesome background score with a emotional end to the avengers....... Iron Man & Captain America will be missed.... awaiting for further movies... Stan lee.... infinity war was better then end game.... the best part of end game was captain america with thors hammer..... that scene got me goosebumps
437,A Modern Day Ben-Hur. I have no words without spoiling it. Just go.
438,Love the direction Marvel is taking. Each movie getting better and better
439,It was a very well integrated collection of stories. I really appreciated intimate character detail.
440,Absolutely speechless.... I have no words to express the absolute masterpiece that marvel has created. Exceptional!
441,"It was good but IW was better. Reminds me of Kill Bill Vol 1, remember how good Volume 1 was, then they released Kill Bill volume 2 and it was anti-climactic and weak compared to the superior first movie. It does have some great scenes but they were few and far between. Movie had too much filler."
442,I am Iron Man. The best heroism. The best end game.
443,"Far too long and uninteresting. No character development. Pacing between large battles and dialogues way off, making both of them equally boring and drawn out."
444,Such a perfect ending to an epic ride for many many years. It got better and better and found its perfection in this very movie. Everything just fitted and at the same time it was so surprising and genuine good writing and editing. All to the point. Only downside has probably been that you overdid it a lil bit with Thor. Infinity war almost the main character with such a cool curve and in this movie more of a goober. But for the sake of the epicness of the rest of the wild ride I'll forget about that.
445,The story and acting was superb with only one stand out exception. Brie Larson's Captain Marvel was far too cocky and rude for her to be believable.
446,"This saga was come from a really long journey to come to this one. honestly i dont really wanna write it down. i just wanna all you WATCH IT !![換行字元][換行字元]if you follow this sequal even if you not reading the comic or even marvel fan boy. just follow from the start. you will know how beautiful this closing is. it still have the same rhythm as infinity war. you get sad and happy, cry and laugh in a complete package and in a really fast moving. God you're not gonna ready for this. A bunch of messages, so remember to focus on every frame if you look close enough you'll noticed this kind of thing. This is a goodbye, you'll find a lot of deep story recap with a beautiful frame in a blink of an eye. Hhaha[換行字元][換行字元]I think that's it for me. Just watch it okay!!![換行字元][換行字元]thanks for this movie. it was beautiful ending."
447,"One of, if not the best superhero movies I have ever seen. A must watch!"
448,"Ten years of my life. The core of a five-year friendship. The writers that made me fall in love with the world, the characters that inspired me to be better, the stories that have sewn themselves into my life and given me so much to laugh, cry, and talk about. This was the perfect end to the most important franchise in my life. It was absolutely wonderful in every way, beautifully written and paced, and I can't imagine that there was any possible way, of 14 million, to end this better than it did.[換行字元][換行字元]I got home and just had no idea what to do. So I thought about how much these stories mean to me, and how much the people in my life mean to me with them.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you, avengers."
449,"Action scenes were nowhere near as great as Infinity Wars, and the overt attempt to pull at the audience heartstrings fell flat for me.[換行字元][換行字元]Not even in my top 5 Marvel films, and I feel like I could have made a much more entertaining story. I'm honestly shocked and wondering what happened. Between this and Captain Marvel, they've lost the magic they've consistently had. Very sad to see it all end in such a drab way."
450,"This movie is as close to perfection as we will see in our lifetime. It's such a shame that there are so many poor reviews of it, since they so obviously don't get the full context. People keep comparing that Avatar was a bold and original movie, and that this is just a remake pf Infinity War. What people need to get is that if you think this film is overrated, you do not understand it. This movie started before Avatar even came out. Every single one of the 21 MCU movies prior to this one relates to it. If you have not seen or reseen them all shortly before watching this movie, there is so much you're gonna miss.[換行字元][換行字元]This is not a stand-alone movie, this is the final scene in a huge, 48 hour, multi-billion dollar legendary story called the Infinity Saga. Not seeing every movie before it is exactly like jumping straight the final season of a television series like Sopranos or Mad Men, expecting it to love up to its reputation.[換行字元][換行字元]This is the best movie I have ever seen, but to appreciate it fully, one has see the 21 other movies first, preferrably twice."
451,"Three Hours, WORTH IT! Honestly, There are so many movies in the Marvel universe, IRON MAN 3 is the best, but I did not expect ENDGAME to take it lightly! Really! I don't lie! It's not because it is final chapter. It's true that you can't think of it as a perfect hero movie. As a movie, ENDGAME has reached the word ""good film"". You will think that three hours is bored, in fact it will not! It constantly gives us excitement, hope, surprise and touch to the audience. In the dialogue, it is inevitable that there are funny humorous lines, so don't be afraid of boring. As for the story I can only say ""nice"" and really like it. The final battle, I am freezed! Super exciting! ! ! I really want to scream loudly! There is also the cameo of STAN LEE. I saw that I really want to give a clap! This year, ENDGAME as my first BEST ENGLISH FILM! ! ! Thanks to the Avengers! Thank you for your ten years of companionship. Goodbye! 🅰VENGERS 🅰SSEMBLE!!!"
452,"People laughed, clapped their hands, some of them cried (including me). And what a satisfying ending, honestly this is best one yet."
453,"As a fan of the MCU I found this a satisfying conclusion to the Infinity War saga.[換行字元][換行字元]As a movie it's not perfect. There are plot holes, many obvious advertisements and product placements,and other equally obvious set ups for various Disney spin offs, like the Loki TV show and the next group of movies.[換行字元][換行字元]But....It is a polished film. A film that features some good performances, notably RDJ and Chris Hemsworth, and some solid CGI and action sequences. It also has the trademark Marvel quipping, some callbacks and emotional farewells, which will entertain anybody who has followed the movie series.[換行字元][換行字元]When I go to see a super hero film,I don't expect logic so the narrative flaws in this didn't bother me, and the movie fulfilled my expectations by providing a satisfying conclusion to the arcs of several characters which I had grown to like over the last 21 films.[換行字元][換行字元]If you are a Marvel movie fan, that likes a bit of escapism, you will probably enjoy the movie. If you are a die hard comic book devotee, you may be disappointed with the treatment of some of your favourites, and if you are looking for a film filled with non stop action, you will also be disappointed."
454,"In life, I believe there is VERY LITTLE things that are either NEAR perfection or ARE perfection....[換行字元][換行字元]Tonight, I witnessed perfection. Avengers: Endgame is simply so UNBELIEVABLE, AMAZING and down right PERFECT.[換行字元][換行字元]If I could give a strong firm handshake to each individual who worked on that movie, I would.[換行字元][換行字元]They did it.

455,It's a great closure. Epic as people called it. Heroes..
456,Great ending for the great heroes... Waiting for the next avengers
457,"Film full of emotions, happiness, fun, anger and sadness, there is a bit of everything"
458,"It is the perfect ending to a decade of MCU character building, everything I was expecting and more, plot twists were great, it was funny as per MCU films but also very serious and sad mixed together in what is a brilliant achievement by the Russo brothers. Well done."
459,"It blows my mind that this movie is rated so highly for how bad it is. It's OK, but it's rated as the #40 best movie as of now. It's just very boring and has no re-watch value."
460,Went to see Endgame this weekend (like most of the world!) for a such a long movie it flew by; the story although slow in parts; creates a great ending and finishing story for some of the avengers. The idea of a time machine disappointed me at first as it's a little far fetched but Marvel managed to pull it off. This is a must for any Marvel fan.
461,"Avengers endgame was in my opinion the best marvel movie to date. It was funny it was sad it had amazing action and amazing dialogue. I also liked how Thanos wasn't in it that much because he was the main character in infinity war. Thanos had 29 minutes, Ironman had 19 and captain America had about 14 in infinity war. I think this is marvel movies at there best I HIGHLY recommend seeing it if you haven't."
462,"I have been looking forward to 'Avengers - End Game' since I saw the first film. The sequel was everything I expected. Action-packed but lots of slow parts, which makes the movie drag at times. But thete were many fast-paced action scenes & I loved the Doctor Who reference. I laughed, I cried, I was on the edge of my seat. Good performances, but almost too many characters for me to keep track of for me. If you love superhero movies, this one is a treat!"
463,Having followed the MCU from start to finish. Its a 3 hr long movie that will tie all the lose and we send you on a emotional roller coaster from beginning to end. You well leave sad and happy at the same time!

467,"As the continuation of the ""Avangers: Infinity War"" movie, this film was successful to make the audience feel very curious about the end of the story. This film tests whether you are really Marvelous or not. When you watch this film, you will feel every second of this film is a pity to miss. Three hours duration of this film feels nothing for me, even I wish it could be a little longer.[換行字元][換行字元]A continuous story from previous films makes this film very interesting to watch and also difficult to predict the end of this film.

Each of actor and artist successfully plays the hero character entrusted to them very well.[換行字元][換行字元]A good teamwork is very highlighted in this film. This film teaches that the optimism in achieving a goal, even though it must pass a big challenge. When I watch this film, I feel touched by the struggle and the sacrifice made by the team. Every scene from this film has its own meaning, even It's not hesitate to shed tears for some sad scenes. I want to watch this movie again and again because i just want to say that this is one of the best Marvel films. If possible, I want to give 11/10 rate for this amazing film."

470,"It's great Avengers finally beat Thanos, iron man took 6 infinity stones from Thanos and flipped the fingers, Thanos became dust left away, but for the whole movie totally no need 181 minutes, I want to say 60% of the part is nonsense and boring, doesn't relate to the plot[換行字元][換行字元]Not worth for 181 minutes, I think only took 90min for the movie that's all"
471,It is just one of the best movies and the best marvel movie so far.
472,This movie has been candidate to the Academy Awards for best picture.
473,"This is not just a Movie it's an Emotional Goodbye of Favourite Characters from Last Decade . This Journey of 22 Movies Was and Will Always be a Favourite for Billions of People around the World .It's Bigger , Better and Full of Fandom Moments"
474,"You will have these set of things that you would expect from a superhero movie and this one checks every box and more. You will definitely will not feel that this was not enough. Just about everything in the right amount. You get laughter,you get a gripping story,you get a wonderful thrilling experience ,if u are a marvel fan then this would be the perfect movie for you. The direction was perfect CGI on point,nothing to change,nothing to correct. The story even lets you brush up on the earlier movies which i felt was awesome, they couldn't have done it any better. Overall OUTSTANDING (MASTERPIECE for a marvel fan) Had to put two verdicts"
475,"There's no word can describe the movie , I think it's The best MARVEL's movie of all time , Masterpiece"
476,"I have waited End Game for one year, after the infinity war. Day by day, my friends and I looked forward every single news about it. And it is really worthy for our patience! Most of the predictions are not correct. The movie has many surprising twists that even a true fan boy cannot predict. In the last 30 minutes of the movie, the sound I could hear clearly was clapping sound continuously from the audiences in the cinema. Awesome movie, great acting and creative surprising story!"
477,"I have seen Avengers Endgame on 24 April 2019 in Cinema. You like Avengers Infinity War, then you will like Avengers Endgame too. This Movie is same good how Avengers Infinity War. In Avengers Endgame we have got a big great battle too. All in one is Endgame a GREAT Avengers movie and a MUST watch movie (in cinema)."
478,"This movie is almost great all around, with a great story and an ending to some characters that were just perfect. This movie definitely doesn't leave out any loose ends, but it does have a problem. The movie completely destroys the character development of some of its beloved characters i.e.Thor. They completely took away everything people liked about Thor, and made him look less like a god, and more... pathetic to say the least."
479,After the movie. All I can think of was grad I am born in the same era with MCU
480,The end of an era. It was a good movie but probably infinity war was better.
481,"Well, i grew up with Star Wars and at the time that was the geekdom holy grail. I personally think that Marvel took this holy grail with the complete MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame has everything a film need. Drama, action, comedy, it was the perfect film for me!"

I was hyped, happy, laughing, hyped again, and cried hella lot. This movie has a perfect ending and it really sums up the entire 22 movies from the past 11 years of the MCU.

483,"I am a huge Marvel fan and have loved the previous Avengers films so went with high Hope's for this, unfortunately I was disappointed beyond belief. Long, slow, dull scences make up most of the movie with only about 10 minutes of actual action. Main characters are sidetracked for less popular ones and the whole film moves at a snail's pace. It really felt like they had run out of ideas and this is just a money making film. So, so let down and would not recommend.. recommend it to anyone"
484,"I enjoyed this more than Infinity War( Infinity War is an absolute blast of a movie so not disrespecting it) purely because I kinda knew there would be a definitive ending to it. Everything you would expect from a MCU movie, the best CGI bar none, laugh out loud humour at times, swift and to the point story telling and some of the best performances from actors/characters that we have enjoyed watching since 2008. For me Chris Evans and RDJ are genuinely a joy to watch on screen together. What I came away with after watching this film is an urge to go back to the beginning, watch all find in the order they were intended ( Cap America, Iron Man etc...) and maybe see them in a new light and understand more how everything ties together leading up to Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]Go watch it, then watch it again and then revisit the MCU from the beginning is what I would recommend. Well done Marvel!"
485,"I've never come out of a film not being able to process what I've just witnessed! This is a masterpiece 10 years in the making! Every aspect of this film is perfect, Marvel and Russo brothers have topped everything that has been done in the past! Avengers: Endgame has scaled heights that I didn't even know were possible![換行字元][換行字元]A 10 out of 10 doesn't do it justice!!"
486,"If you write a bad review of Avengers Endgame then your not a fan just an odd bod who drop in to see what all the fuss is about , A true fan understands the Characters and there story's before this film , which makes no sense to an odd bod who just drop in , THIS FILM WAS MADE FOR FANS !!! true marvel fans , so don't Judge this film if you don't understand it , it's just you've missed all the other films which built up to this film , It's like seeing a tv series and just watching the last episode and marking a judgement on the hole series , You just don't understand it so you can't ."
487,"Endgame is everything I wanted and more. I was bawling by the end of it like most everyone else. YES, THIS IS LESS ACTION HEAVH THAN INFINITY WAR. GET OVER IT. The Russos understand the MCU is about it's characters first and foremost and this was nothing more and nothing less than a love letter to the MCU and its fans. Definitely watch it if you love this universe and it's characters"
488,Worst film in MCU so far! Totally missed the expectations after Avengers:Infinity War was so great.
489,"This was a breathtaking and amazing movie. It's a wonderfully filmed movie, and it proves, in my opinion, again, that Marvel has aced it again, dominating DC. It isn't your typical action-packed superhero movie that's cheesy and is only about getting the villains. It shows meaning, and it shows how far they've come, how much they are willing to save their people. It made me cry...when they all charged out from the portals, and it made me tearful when there were lost ones. It was breathtaking, really, it is one of my favorite films by far, and it is full of amazing scenery, and action, and amazing music, with a beautiful passage behind. It was truly very meaningful...and this is why I want to remember Stan Lee forever, and Marvel itself. Everyone has done amazing acting, and it truly warms my heart to see how far everyone has come. Marvel makes a change in everyone's lives. This was the movie I was most excited for this year, and I was not disappointed. It went even higher than my expectations. Even higher. And even though there might be sad woes, it is true and hits back home, and it will leave you speechless."
490,"I'm eating peanut m$m's while boringly reading crap reviews, I would like to talk to some of these people and ask what they want. Why can't people just enjoy movies, it's a super hero movie, nothing is real. It's for fun"
491,"I think film is entering a post-cliche phase, where tired tropes are no longer tired, but are now just accepted tools in a storyteller's toolbox. Certainly we don't need to enforce originality on all forms of art. I adore this film. The entire MCU is a breathtaking opera, and this is the ten-year grand finale. You *do* need to see all twenty-one previous films (in chronological order, hopefully, rather than release order) because taken on its own, ""Endgame"" would be a mishmash, with so many of its call-backs missed.[換行字元][換行字元]I think film is also leaving the era of the auteur, and entering that of the committee. George Lucas may have been the final straw, as when Disney (the originators of the committee method, from what I can tell) picked up the mantle of that particular franchise, their natural choice to revert to committee decisions dovetailed with everyone's need to get franchises out of one person's control. The MCU was planned out ten years in advance, so that almost at once -- and certainly by Ultron -- ""Endgame"" was being envisioned. Seeing how all the disparate threads meet and find either their resolution or their own inspiring arc, that *in itself* is amazing. Knowing that, in the most crucial moment of the film, we get a familiar call-back to a much earlier part of the MCU, elevates the experience from one of possible bewilderment to outright joy. It's no wonder that other directors would defer this type of blockbuster to the Russos. I only wonder how anyone involved in the creative process could have kept these secrets to themselves for ten years. Knowing that this film makes its predecessor seem like a prelude, and all the other significant milestones in the franchise series seem like blips on a radar, it must have been nerve-wracking to know how all of this turns out and still feed us those ""massive"" revelations in the earlier films.[換行字元][換行字元]When in the right context, a superlative experience. As good a film experience as you will find. Yes, if you don't gel with the film, it could strike you any number of odd ways, but most people are on board with it being a new classic."
492,"I admit I had fairly high expectations for this movie, but in this instance I find it justified given the buildup to this particular movie.[換行字元][換行字元]To put it shortly, it is inferior to Infinity War in every way. I've seen infinity war probably 8 times now and Endgame makes me appreciate it even more. The pacing and execution of Infinity War is incredible in comparison. Infinity war felt like a much more mature movie in that there are moments that still make me feel sadness for the characters and the pacing of the movie was far better. Endgame felt all over the place. There were moments I wanted to tear up but the scenes didn't feel adequate to really draw a reaction. They moved on far too quickly and the movie itself was choppy. It was hard to really relate to the characters. When I first saw Infinity War I wondered how they would handle so many characters in one film and be able to still have the audience empathize with them, but any doubts were laid to rest. This movie is pretty much the worst case scenario for how to handle many characters.[換行字元][換行字元]Don't get me wrong, there were parts that were quite satisfying, which is hard to go into further detail about without divulging too much information.[換行字元][換行字元]All in all this movie was saved by particular scenes and those few moments of feeling resolution. It felt more childish in execution and appeal and Infinity War felt more mature than the typical Marvel movie. When I saw Captain Marvel I really disliked it, but I thought it was a one off and they would be redeemed with Endgame. This was not the case.[換行字元][換行字元]Definitely see it, and see it in theatres if you can, just don't go in with the highest of expectations."
493,This movie was an hour and a half too long! The first half of the movie was slow and uninteresting. It did improve as it went along but was unnecessarily long and carried on with so much non sense that was not essential to the plot. Another example of an over hyped film doing well at the box office because of a big budget and star power. It is marginally better than the last Avengers movie but still mediocrity at its best.
494,"Watched the movie with lots of expectations and it didn't disappoint the world. Beautifully done with great of everything. The greatest, mind blowing and mind storming. The perfect combination of joy, entertainment and feelings."
495,"Having seen fewer Marvel movies than I could count on one hand, I was able to look at this movie for how it stands on its own. I did see Infinity War and one of the other Avengers titles, however. Overall, the story is a bit contrived and with all the time travel ""escape clauses"", not a fully satisfying conclusion. At the end we get what seems like an Olympic torch run of superheros passing around the family jewels. I guess there were too many contracts to satisfy. Undisciplined execution, overly long."
496,"Here is my spoiler free review, I often like to discuss the negatives of a movie before the positives so here goes.[換行字元][換行字元]I didn't quite enjoy Endgame as much the first time around since I had been spoiled about significant events in the film and it does suffer from quite a few plot holes. Some events aren't explained quite enough and require a good bit of mental gymnastics to hurdle. My main complaint like many others, despite not having much screen time, is Brie Larson (more on that later). Captain Marvel's movie, of which I do share the popular dislike for, was released barely over a month before Endgame. This is important because she is quite arrogant and emotionless in Endgame, a popular argument being Tony Stark is quite arrogant also, however we have had over a decade and 10 movies to watch and understand Stark's backstory and why he is this way, Captain Marvel not so much. I do however give Brie Larson the benefit of the doubt, after seeing how she is in interviews and such, I do believe the blame here lies with the directors. Larson and Marvel seem like completely different people. Her appearance is downgraded later in the movie too. There's also a scene with Fortnite.. which of course speaks for itself.[換行字元][換行字元]All of the above is why I simply cannot give it a 10, one may think how can so many negatives only deduct 1 from a perfect score? Well, staying true to a spoiler free review that is quite the task to explain of course.[換行字元][換行字元]As with any avid fan like myself and having watched Iron Man in cinemas 11 years ago, here we are 22 movies later and there isn't much more I could've asked for. Lot's of previous questions answered, closure brought to many story-lines, many epic moments and surprises. Had the franchise not been so long until this point, my rating most likely would've been 7.5. Somebody that has watched all previous instalments will appreciate Endgames nods at it's predecessors, lots of rewards for longtime fans. Is it as good as Infinity War? Not quite, it does shortly follow however, up there with my favourites IW, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man. A must watch for any Marvel fan. There are however still unanswered questions as with any MCU movie, which will most likely be answered in the upcoming titles.[換行字元][換行字元]TLDR: Slightly political, plot holes and an undesirable character that ultimately get's trumped by the excellence of the other 95%"
497,"About 7,500 people rated this great movie with 1/10. I wonder if they really watched it or are just DC fans... Nevertheless this is the best superhero movie of all time so far!"
498,"Not the best movie in the universe. Not adrenaline rush kinda movie. But it is the best ending, the best closure and most satisfying of all time. Got all we need got all the answer. Full range of emotions. This is the PERFECT ENDING FOR Avengers Era."
499,Film which triggered a lot of emotion. Fantastic end to the franchise.
500,Out of all 3 hours of film there was an only 20 mins of pure entertainment
501,"Loved every second of it, must see!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
502,"Thank you Joe and anthony Russo sometimes you drag the plot in begging but it will lead to greater things...The end game ending will be the satisfying ending to whom astonished when infinity war ended.The only complaint i have is Thor's ark is little bit unsatisfied to me.I am a cap and Thor fan so the other ark is very beautifully played in the movie. Black widow performance is one of the best in years in MCU.Hawkeye is awesome.Iron man is Emotional throughout the film.Hulk is like what I want from him,we all see how hulk smash throughout MCU..but in this you will see how big brain works...say Green.Original Avengers,Rhodey,nebula,Rocket,okoye,Scott lang(paul Rudd nailed the role) Everybody is Awesome.If you are fan of MCU 22 films will be revolve around your head in theatre.There are lot of Easter eggs in end game.The final conclusion is Everybody needs a happy ending but that's not the way destiny works.End game is not the End of MCU But to a new beginning.-As a cap fan"
503,Story not good .. that's way i don't like this type of move.
504,"Endgame is the worst superhero movie I've seen, it's full of lazy bad writing, this is a shame to cinema, endgame was a disapointing predictable end to a mediocre franchise"
505,I'll rerate it when I se it in better video quality. It was better than infinity war and infinity war is one of the best Marvel movies i think. Ser the movie!
506,"As the conclusion of the current MCU, it does a great job. Everything ties together well. Wouldn't be surprised if they had this whole movie script all but finalized 10 years ago. Even opened a few new possibilities of future story lines. Mildly disappointed with how Captain Marvel was utilised.[換行字元][換行字元]Aside from the MCU stuff; as an actual movie, I had far too many problems with it. From certain fight sequences, to one dimensional characters, to forced diversity, to pacing issues.[換行字元][換行字元]TL;DR Great MCU conclusion, decent movie"
507,"It's simple.[換行字元][換行字元]If you don't like or follow Marvel movies then don't watch.[換行字元][換行字元]If you do, then this is a quite fitting conclusion to the first phase of Marvel movies. Absolutely enthralling and unpredictable from start to end.[換行字元][換行字元]I was terrified that they'd drop the ball with the final movie. Infinity Wars was okay but not great...but this movie is a near perfect finale.[換行字元][換行字元]Enjoy!"
508,"A worthy follow-up to Infinity War with a lot of action, humour and drama. Couple of plot contrivances, but you can easily overlook them."
509,"Was very entertaining, marvel hasn't really put a foot wrong compared to DC. Feels like the end of the franchise too an I need not need to see anymore from the franchise. Thanks for the memories maybe?"
510,Just watched the new Avengers-movie. It's simply fantastic and a must-watch for every Marvel-Fan. It contains everything I expected and wished for an so much more. It's hard to put in words without a spoiler. Find out by yourself and enjoy.
511,"It was an epic ending to the avengers movies. Best 3 hours and 1 minute of my life, definitely worth it! It was very emotional, at least for me. Tom holland, best avenger!"
512,A movie which was not expected but a movie which was truly deserved.
513,Marvel let us down this time for real bad film bad jokes
514,"Just unbelievable, you never know what is going to happen."
515,"Avengers you surpassed yourselves. Loved the storyline, character development and everything in-between."
516,"I won't say much here, this is something you need to experience yourself. Hard to comprehend the varying emotions in this movie, and I guess that's what makes this the most brilliant end, to an even better ride. Marvel has outdone itself! 10/10 for the journey.[換行字元][換行字元]Ps - No end credit scenes. But I guess you'll be seated till the end of the credits anyway. It's hard to walk away from."
517,Entertaining movie. Mostly just fan service and weird plot holes. Go watch it. You've invested 10 years now. It's funny
518,Not fair to Thor. 5/10 Cheesy jokes and So conclusion. Just A Business Movie on Super Hyped Fan base.
519,"Great story, phenomenal actors, amazing cgi and cinematography, awesome battles."
520,"Avengers: Endgame is directed by the Russo brothers and is the 22nd film in the MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]The film picks up after the tragedy of Infinity War, and now the Avengers must find a way to undo what Thanos has done with the Infinity Stones.[換行字元][換行字元]Since the film is 3 hours long, it not only has some of the most incredible action sequences of the whole MCU, but also has incredible character building that we haven't seen from these characters before.[換行字元][換行字元]The acting is great and the visuals are fantastic.

I don't love all of it because Marvel have developed such great characters and I don't know how much I love their ends.[換行字元][換行字元]As a movie it's a 10! It's got everything you want and also some stuff you didn't know you'd want and now wish for more.[換行字元][換行字元]I will miss my dose of Avengers...can't wait for what's to come and the bar's been set really high.

524,"After 21 movies, this epic saga has come to an end. Avengers Endgame is one of the finest superhero movie ever made. The movie perfectly captures what made this franchise so unique and dear to all the fans. The movie is packed with humor, emotional moments and offcourse some epic battles. Those who are the old fans will obviously love this movie but the new ones who haven't seen any marvel movie would still find something good. Overall this movie is not just an movie but an experience. An experience of lifetime which can only be enjoyed on the largest screen possible."
525,Waste of money.. if this was nr 1 of 2 I wouldn't have seen nr 2.
526,"When I first saw the movie I was left thinking that I expected more. With that said, after time to reflect, it maybe a masterpiece. Do yourself a favor, as you're watching this movie remember how we got here. Then imagine where it will. I wasn't disappointed and I can't wait to see what's next."
527,"This movie could of easily been 2 hours. Cant believe how close I was to falling asleep during it. Yes are there a few good actions, sure are. But there is too much stalling and 'build up"" between. There were already 22 films for build up. Enough with the fore play. It was time for a the pay off and sadly they dropped the ball."
528,"Everything in the MCU was building to this point...now here stand at the end of Phase 3. Were you elated or disappointed at how it turned out? For me, I was so into this one I didn't even take a potty break during this 3 hour marathon. I was so jazzed about this, that I might have given it a perfect 10.

If you haven't...assemble your fellow MCU fans and go see it."
529,At First at Avengers Infinity War Ending I couldn't waith for the Next Avengers End Game.But Iron Man died and Captian America got old but this was a Great Film I'm Gonna miss the Avengers.
530,"Well, what can I say? I am extremely lost for words. I won't spoil the plot, but all I can say is go see this film!!! It's going to be hard to say goodbye to the actors that played the iconic original six Avengers characters. You would defiantly feel bittersweet while watching the film. I laughed, I cried, I gasped! I felt the same emotions when I watched Infinity War!![換行字元][換行字元]GO SEE THIS FILM!!!!!!"
531,"Kevin Feige and the Russo Brothers have done a fantastic job here. The film is guilty of a fair amount of inevitable plot holes, for which it cannot be considered a 10/10; yet it does a fantastic job of bringing a worthy conclusion to the 22 MCU films so far. It succeeds in juggling the many character arcs, moving pieces and increasingly complicated storylines whilst keeping the movie focused and making room for some truly thrilling action sequences in addition to many laugh-out-loud moments.[換行字元][換行字元]It's certainly worth watching Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor 2: the Dark Wold, Avengers Assemble, Captain America the Winter Soldier or, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers Infinity War, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Doctor Strange and Thor Ragnarok at the least before viewing this film. As reflected by certain reviews, there are many parts of the film which would seem confusing or frankly boring without the knowledge of the various storylines involved, yet which will be of great interest to followers of the MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]Having watched this film I'm truly excited for phase 4 of the direction the MCU looks to be taking going forward."
532,Watch it honestly. My 5th grade sexual harassment class had more relevance then this. And I made the mistake of buying it.
533,"Didn't feel like the right time to introduce captain marvel. an extraordinarily powerful character who is absent for most of the movie when the stakes are highest. just doesn't make sense,[換行字元][換行字元]to me it would have been a better change over to the next MCU phase if the character was introduced in the end credits like she was in infinity war.[換行字元][換行字元]apart from that the film carried its weight and was very faithful to the arcs of the original 6 avengers. the ending was satisfying and neatly ties up this phase of MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]not as good as infinity war but its always hard to get the final movie/episode right. endwar is to infinity war is as ROTJ is to ESB."

535,"If you're a fan of the MCU, this movie most likely maxes out at about an 8/10. If you're a fan of superhero movies, this movie is not for you. Slow drama scenes fill the better part of a very long run time, leading to a 3 hour long superhero movie with only a handful of fight scenes and minimal action.[換行字元][換行字元]Rather predictable for the most part. Very hit-or-miss: either a dream come true or quite mediocre. For the ""movie of the century"", it sure was a let down, that's for sure."
536,This is nice but sometimes comedy and It should not have been Tony's death.
537,This movie was the perfect culmination of the past 10 years of story building for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The threads they have been weaving for the characters and their connections to each other. You take this journey with then and the time jump to 2023 fixes any future cinematic timeline issues moving forward lol.
538,Boring long and expected Infinity war was more excited
539,Awesome is the only word that describes it. Terrific sequel.
540,"Though there are many bugs in this movie, it is still the best"
541,"Man.. that was absolutely amazing.. well done.. i'm speechless, best movies ever.."
542,Think that summarises it. Look the plot has the odd nice twist and some of the jokes hit home but honestly three hours with this sort of pacing is a struggle. Think I'd have preferred to watch it at home.
543,"So to begin with, if I give a score of 2.5 it doesn't mean that I didn't like it but that I'm undecided enough about this film... it's not bad or excellent for all that, but I would say that I still wonder... right away I preferred the previous Infinity War because there was no subtlety in the story... Here we have for 3 hours of film 3 distinct time stages that I will let you discover for yourself. At the end of the session I said to myself that the end of Infinity War was already a beautiful conclusion and for me we didn't need a sequel... because I felt that the film was not necessarily necessary and useful... I won't spoil the 3 temporal stages of the film but if I think that the very first hour is for me the conclusion of Infinity War and well it was sufficient... the heroes question themselves and each one wants to live their life in peace... why go further? you would tell me but it's the cinema and the taste of adventure so let's go and shake up the laws of nature;... why not... I'm not against it but still need the 2nd temporal stage of the film to hold its own and its part a little in all directions and so I say to myself.. how did they do it?... did I miss any steps? because they will see and see even a little too fast to realize their plan... a lot of inconsistency in this 2nd temporal step... and I confess to you that I was looking forward to seeing the 3rd and last step of the story... I like it a little better because I feel that the Russo brothers feel more comfortable when it comes to action-reaction... here I dive into it and as if by magic... more inconsistency everything works... ok I start to sink pleasantly into my seat and for the little anecdote I brought a little cushion.... because 3 hours of film is long and I didn't regret it.....) and Thor's Thunder Slap... a magnificent conclusion to the 11 years of Marvel Cinema Universe with CGIs worthy of the 2 billion box office receipts won on Inifinity War.. rather satisfied on this side because my eyes were on Thanos and feeling not knowing if he will win or not denotes a pretty good kinematic construction of this 3rd time step which is almost perfect... but... I don't understand why the Russo brothers chose this or that character to put value on End-Game... I can understand for one... but not for another... the characters play well because they play their final conclusion and I greet the actors who have put all their knowledge and potential... Robert Downey J.R, Scarlette Johansson, Chris Evans... and the beautiful Brie Larson whom I liked well here in her costume and in her appearances... well done my best... but for the others rather disappointed I almost didn't want to see them so much some shocked me visually.. I wouldn't say their names but when you see them you'll understand who I'm talking about... for me End-Game is not the end of Inifnity War was enough but overall the movie is good but doesn't excel in its choices, its manners and its script construction... Will it exceed Infinity War at the Box office? certainly that yes but not many except surprise..... the craze will be there but if some fans are satisfied with the conclusion just like me others are likely to be even more disappointed... With a budget of 500 million we could have done even more impressive... hence my average score. Goodbye to the old Avengers team and welcome to the new future... which will give us new adventures."
544,"End game was so melodramatic and slow! can't believe it needed 3 hours! I was expecting something ala infinity war, but no, this is no way near that movie..."
545,"With among the biggest anticipation for a film ever this film needed to deliver and it did just that.[換行字元][換行字元]A comparatively slow start was great build up to a huge ending and an excellent ending to the saga.[換行字元][換行字元]Massive shocks and big plot twists make this a film that's essential to see twice to take everything in I think. The acting and animation is about as good as it gets for now. Some great humour as well.[換行字元][換行字元]I will be shocked if another film in 2019 tops this in the film charts and maybe, as sagas go, star wars is now knocked off its perch at the top."
546,A perfect ending to infinity saga... By watching it u will feel that. A long film but u never feel that.
547,That is the one what I expected from entire movie history.
548,I LOVED every minute of Endgame. Thank you for such an amazing ride!
549,One of the most brilliant movies I ever seen And it very much important that the 21 film of the 3 phases to be shown before to understand and to feeling every min in this film

After five or six years after this, could there be something about this movie that makes recomended, else of his hype and the marketing?[換行字元][換行字元]I Am not a really Marvel or DC's fan, but i loved some of their movies such as; DC's: Dark Knight all, Wonder Woman, Man on Steel, Shazam. And Marvel's: Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr Strange, Winters soldier, and of Course: Infinity War. But i was waiting a lot about this, i has too big expectations, them go to the midnight releasing and i found a fast food product of movie; horrible script, horrible performance, stupid logic, terrible story. Really is this the current cinema's way? I ll'get out of this awful and cheap movie theather."
551,"I know I gave it a 9/10 but there's a reason for that there are 2 epic scenes in this film that deserve the 9/10 rating, but the movie overall was 7/10 maybe a little lower 6.9/10, I just expected more, this morning or started great and surprising, but then the middle was lost and messy to say the least the ending was epic though,"
552,"A Treat for the Generations to come, and a emotional roller coaster for the MCU fans, I am an Indian and a cricket lover and i felt the same kind of emotions I've felt on the day Sachin Tendulkar announced his retirement"

555,Easily the best marvel film to exist. You'll most likely cry in the cinema
556,"11 years and 22 films later we've been gifted with the end of the Infinity Saga and Avengers: Endgame is a brilliant ending. The MCU has created a powerful dynasty that we have never seen in Hollywood before and I doubt we will see it again. For 11 years these movies have inspired me beyond anything else, and for that I have to thank Marvel, Stan Lee, Kevin Feige, the crew of each movie and the original six: Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner. Especially Robert Downey Jr, without him none of this would have been possible, he is a legend and what he helped to create is pure magic."
557,"This movie was horrendous - it seems like the script was written by a 10 year old. The humor was terrible and the story was fragmented. Really don't understand how people are rating this so high. Maybe another movie, Idiocracy, explains it all - people are just satisfied by dumber crap."
558,I didn't like being disappointed by it but it didn't do all the years of build up and the characters justice. It has good comedy but ultimately felt like a lacklustre way to end things. Less of an Endgame more of just an ending.
559,It was extremely disappointing. Crammed every politically correct them down your throat.
560,"I'm going to see this movie ina couple of hours. And while no one has spoiled this movie for me yet, I don't know why they are airing so many spoilers in TV spots? First the trailer shows Tony stuck in space, and now the TV spot shows Tony with the other Avengers in those white stormtrooper like suits. It tells us Tony survived Space. Also they put out the trailer for the next Spider-Man movie so we know he comes back (as expected).[換行字元][換行字元]So knowing all this I'm gonna go watch this in IMAX 3D, and I'll add my review to this post once seen."
561,"I went & saw Avengers EndGame this pass weekend, the film is very good, but when this movie comes to one of my classics movies I have seen in years, I just can't put it up against Harry Potter, to be honest the ending of Avengers EndGame is similar on Voldemort's downfall in Deathly Hallows part 2, but however Thanos is my 2nd favorite villain in the movie, this doesn't mean I like the villains for real Im actually natural I love the bad guys & I certainly love the good guys as well, so I grew up as a huge Harry Potter fan and I'm starting to grew up on Wrestling too so basically Avengers EndGame is definitely on my top 10 favorite movies I have Reviewed[換行字元][換行字元]1: Harry Potter Series - 10/10[換行字元][換行字元]2: Fantastic Beast Series so far 7.5/10 there will be 3 more Fantastic Beast films in the future[換行字元][換行字元]3: Fighting With My Family - 9.5/10[換行字元][換行字元]& number 4: Avengers EndGame 9.5/10[換行字元][換行字元]So I certainly love most of the movie The comedies were so good & the last 45 or possibly an hour of the action is amazing, don't forget all movies is really not perfect at all you gotta make it feel like is a perfect movie to you, everyone has different opinions what they think about the movie, so that's my review for Avengers EndGame, I highly recommend it for everyone"
562,This movie had everything that i wanted. I won't spoil a thing. Go watch it and enjoy it to its fullest
563,One of the best movie ever !!!!! The entry the emotion the sacrifices all are just perfectly portrayed... i think watching it for less than twice is a sin !
564,"Every moment in this movie just makes you surprised, laughed, cried and in the end, it still brings to a close of an Era of MCU FILMS. Truly a Marvel movie indeed. P.S The best yet and will probably gonna watch the second time"
565,"I was super hyped for Avengers: Endgame after the fantastic Avengers: Infinity War last year. I always wondered ""How were they going to top it?"" so what was the result after sitting in a cinema for almost 3 hours? I came out a little underwhelmed, honestly. I must stress that I don't think Endgame is a bad movie by any means, it's just the bar set by Infinity War was so high for me that all the shortcomings and issues I had with Endgame made me feel like it was the weaker half of the story by quite a significant amount in comparison.[換行字元][換行字元]One thing I really noticed in Endgame was the pacing and structure of the movie was all over the place. There were weird tangents in the story that didn't really go anywhere and were just used as a quick gag or fan service. Compared to Infinity War where everything flowed so smoothly, it felt to me Endgame's writing was quite sloppy in places. The jokes were not hitting quite as well, and characters were acting differently just for the sake of a contrived moment or joke to occur. Without spoiling anything, Thanos for example seems completely different in Endgame to what he was in Infinity War. There were just so many moments where characters were acting un-natural, that it was distracting.[換行字元][換行字元]As for the characters and emotional moments, Captain Marvel honestly might as well never have been in this movie. She barely does anything. Iron Man and Captain America get the most screentime for a good reason and have nice conclusions. The Hulk feels toned down here alot and left to the sides. Thor is mostly comic relief here, so if you never found Thor: Ragnarok funny, you might hate him big time here. The others have shared screentime and you do see alot of characters in this movie. It does have a big finale feel to it, and there are many nice references to previous Marvel movies in there too. If you've seen Back to the Future: Part II, that's basically how the Time Travel stuff works. Just try not to think about it too much, otherwise the inconsistencies might annoy you.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, I still had a blast with Avengers: Endgame. I was never bored despite the lengthy running time. However, the reason why I felt a little let down, despite still liking it, is that re-watching Infinity War just the night before was close to perfection at telling that side of the story. The sequence of events, the humour, the emotional beats, and the characters all acted at their very best in Infinity War. Endgame to me, felt like a noticeable drop in quality despite the grandness and scale of it acting as a swan song to the MCU Universe. I'm not sure where Marvel can go from here. They've pretty much done the most epic Comic Book Superhero movie storyline they could have ever done, so what's next?[換行字元][換行字元]7.5/10"
566,"A good watch, but very long, serious and hard on my brain. Expert commentary from my daughter helped."
567,"To describe this movie, let's just say it was 'AWESOME!!'. The plot hole might be confusing for some people. But if you are a true marvel fan, you will be able to understand the storyline here. And yeah! NUFF SAID!!"
568,Literally the best thing ever now I have gained my purpose in life
569,"It is the best movie in Marvel history i think. First of all, all character's acting was good. I waited endgame so long after the Avengers infinity war. People have high expectation. In infinity war most of heroes and people died. And i tried to predict how died heroes coma back, how they win Thanos, how ending can be. finally i just want to you advice one thing, go to the theater and watch it. You won't regret."
570,I have to say that is was the best Marvel movie so far. It left me speachless on couple ocasions. I went through all types of emotions in just 3 hours. Russo brothers did an amazing job keeping us on the dark side with the trailers. I LOVE IT!!!
571,This is a complete film that completes a Phase of 22 films. The Marvel Universe gets a closure to the Infinity Saga. The film couldn't be more better. it is simply flawless . It is an experience. Just go and watch it and enjoy
572,"Great movie... I really applaud it for having a clear structure, as there was a distinct beginning, middle and end. The story was really well told. It had a great balance of comedy and seriousness. It was really gripping and was able to evoke a lot of emotions.[換行字元][換行字元]My only 'critique' is that I think the beginning was too slow. To explain, although I think that segment was fantastic as a whole and I recognize that it gave context to the rest of the movie (and it did that well)... ultimately, I think it would have been beneficial to cut out some of those scenes.[換行字元][換行字元]Apart from that, I have no complaints. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it was a brilliant ending to the avengers series."
573,"The last 45 minutes were fully action packed. The first 2 hours more emotionally inclined mostly. Though there were a few scenes that defy logic even for avengers movies according to me, the climax leaves you with satisfaction for waiting 3 hours. Worth the imax ticket money and a year long wait!!!"
574,"I have nothing to say except this movie is overrated and the only reason why people went to it was because, Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger."
575,"Drama. Thrills. Funny. Emotional. It had it all. This is what you call great storytelling. All these years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have led to this moment and boy did they deliver, easily the most anticipated movie ever.[換行字元][換行字元]Usually when a movie is this hyped up, it fails to live up to expectations because everyone's thinking it'll be so good and then it's just a let down, however. BUT, Avengers: Endgame delivered!!! Brilliant!"
576,A great ending for this particular marvel storyline and cast of great actors. This movie contains ell the elements we have come to love since the first Ironman. But this time on overdrive.
577,What a way to complete the avengers by far the best marvel film ever story was just mind blowing. This film will go down in history as one of the very best!
578,"After the disappointing ""age of ultron"", infinity war was a breath of fresh air. Endgame,however, feels like a rush job, playing on the cliche time travel trope. The writers for endgame were better off letting Thanos keep the stones and having the avengers deal with their losses for the first half of the movie. I would of love to see thanos get to utilize the different stones and their abilities, instead of having the movie turn into ""battle for the snap"". The cliche girl power moment towards the end of the film was also cringe, you already did that in infinity war so it doesn't have that same impact this time around. Also the confusion, if there are 3 different tesseract's for the sake of plot, does that mean there are three different thanos? does the snap only defeat that timelines thanos or does he still exist in other timelines? The movie had it's moments, but i didn't leave feeling excited about it like infinity war, and once again the black order is useless, but whatever i'll still show up for avengers 5."
579,"Going in to this movie I had all the expections in the world for it, but I can honestly say that all of these expectations were exceeded. I'm not saying that it is the best film ever made, but this was, and nothing comes even close to it, the best movie experience I have ever had.[換行字元][換行字元]It had everything - the Marvel humor we have all come to expect, it had me sobbing multiple times, almost even fully crying, and then it had jaw-dropping action sequences, forever to be remembered iconic moment, and lovely small little details that left you with a smile on you're face.[換行字元][換行字元]Simply put: this movie was the best possible ending to a universe spanding many fantastic years. It was absolutely amazing!"
580,Overly farfetched even for a comic book based movie. First 2 hours very slow. Last hour big budget gains points. 100% worth a watch but it isn't the best film in the marvel universe.
581,"As the ending of such a wonderful saga, Endgame surely is breathtaking and magnificent. The storyline flows and the timeline all well made, the acting performance is awesome, and though it's also heartbreaking not give you what you want, but it give you what you need. It's like the journey of life, where the ride bring you up and down, tears and joys, laugh and cries, but it the end, you get what you need. Not always what you want, but what you need."
582,It is a beautiful film and worth watching and has a special artistic touch I swear..... Reda El Alaoui
583,Not enough action Not enough Spider-Man[換行字元][換行字元]Well not enough word for making a review
584,"The movie has a ton of plotholes and things that you'll think about after the movie. That being said you should enjoy this movie if you're a Marvel fan. Many great actors, superheroes, action, etc. Must watch if you've been keeping up with all of the other MCU movies."
585,This movie was the perfect ending to The Infinity Saga in every way. That's all I have to say
586,It's well directed. It's well edited. Great use of chi and it also gives a emotional punch along the way of this roller coaster ride of a movie
587,Perfect ending to a great story that we have been lucky to see over the last decade
588,"I am not huge fan of superhero movies but this was really worth watching, it is just not worthless action(fightings and all) but a full package with different genres. Still giving it a star less as i told you before not a huge fan of superhero movies 😉"
589,"The emotions, the action, the love.. you literally feel every emotion in this movie, it is truly a gift to all marvel fans, it is a farewell well deserved.. thanks to marvel for producing this masterpiece.. Go in for the biggest experience, shock and surprise of your life!!!"
590,It was The best film I wached I like all of marvell comany films but it was diffrent this film exited me and I really like it
591,"I can say no more than, that it was really great. Loved it, will see it again"
592,"Actors are always heart of every movie, they give it emotion, and something special... or at least they should. It looks like creators of this movie wanted the movie to be emotional and heart warming but it was far from it. It is soulless piece of crap. I liked it very much watching it for the first time, they made it entertaining for me and I was not bored, but on the other hand it was so empty and forgetable. Characters are somewhat entertaining but they look very much archetypal and not like real human beings, some characters are not human, but you know what I mean...[換行字元][換行字元]It has certian style that is somewhat entertaining, but it has no charm like some other movies... No charm at all. So, get your popcorn and enjoy brainless fighting sequences and archetypal characters, kinda fun dialogue and cool CGI planets."
593,"The actors who brought these characters to life gave us scenes, quotes and feelings that will live with us for the rest of our lives the movie is a fans dream come true,we as fans would like to thank Stan Lee and the rest of the Marvel family.Thank You!"
594,"This movie is not just a movie, it's an event. A payoff after 11 years of build up. If you've not been in the marvel train, then you'll enjoy this movie. However, if you've grown up with these characters, this movie is everything you'll ever want, and so much more."
595,Greatest movie ever. Hats off to the creators and the cast. Would recommend everyone one out there to watch it. Has everything nostalgic to sentimental vibes a perfect example of what a new era movie should be. I bet even the toughest men alive will cry watching it. Respect to those who sacrificed themselves in the making of a great legacy.
596,"After 11 years and 22 films in the making, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become one of the ballsiest experiments ever taken in cinematic history, and one that has captured entire generations. Perhaps the most anticipated blockbuster since Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Avengers: Endgame marks the culmination of the first 3 phases of this forever running series, wrapping up multiple storylines and character arcs in the process.[換行字元][換行字元]After the shocking and devastating events of 2018's Infinity War, the original Avengers are left stranded on Earth with no clear path of their futures. The mad titan Thanos wiped out 50% of the population and the world has become something of an apocalyptic wasteland. They can either move forward and live different lives or find a way to bring back what was once present.[換行字元][換行字元]The second of a two-part finale is shaped over a 3 hour and 1-minute runtime, and the result is a roller coaster ride unlike anything Marvel has ever done before. If Infinity War was the ultimate fan film, Endgame is a different beast. Its predecessor was an ensemble piece, a simple good-vs-evil plot populated with multiple characters while blending humour and character motivations to spectacular effect. This is more like an old fashioned epic, channelling ambition, scope, and storytelling as dense as films from Lawrence of Arabia to The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.[換行字元][換行字元]Screenwriters Christopher Marcus and Stephen McFeely and directors Joe and Anthony Russo work hard to focus on the right elements of the storyline, without disastrously going off the rails. The script is mostly absorbed with the past, creating not just a sense of nostalgia and poignancy, but overall a unique viewpoint on the past 22 films. It makes you realise how far these characters have come, which feels satisfying. Even if the action and special effects are, for the most part, impressive, the film's strong point is the character focus, which was the perfect direction to take.[換行字元][換行字元]There are a few stumbles along the way. The pacing can be bumpy across 3 hours, especially when expositional scenes frequently overstay their welcome. You cannot help but feel overwhelmed at times due to the overstuffed amount of story, which can make action scenes feel less satisfying than they should. But for a finale as monumental as this film, not everything can work. There are more stories to tell, but there is no doubt that anything following on will come close to matching the brilliance of Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]Finally, this is a Marvel film that demands repeated viewings. Mark my words!"
597,"***No Spoilers*** Epic doesn't begin to describe the absolute amazing experience this movie was. A journey to infinity stones and beyond!!! Loved the movie. The characters, the emotions, the storyline, the special effects, the infinity stones... All of it... An Experience!!! Thank you..."
598,"The biggest minus is, the movie is rushed up. Way too many things to solve and conclude even in this marathon of three hours. Some lost battle opportunities between some characters, plot holes, lazy writing and not enough explained things. But you cannot explain everything and please everybody in a superhero movie. Maybe a trilogy of 7 hours in total, instead of two movies of 5.40 cumulated would have been better. Anyway. The movie is not bad. It has some good performances, especially RDJ's one, it is emotional, it has totally unexpected turns and of course the pretty CGI. It is worth the wait and worth seeing it in cinema 3D. But don't you dare drink something before, or until the last half hour. 3h long, remember?"
599,"This movie is honestly the Empire Strikes Back of Marvel. A lot of movies aren't nearly as good. Firstly, the CGI, the action, and just the special effects on the heroes, they're top notch. Second, I know that this movie doesn't exactly have the action throughout because of the time travel plot, well there's a quite a bit of action scenes, but it gives us a enjoyable throwback to the old MCU movies and saves the big blockbuster action for the finale and there's nothing to be said of the finale except for one word: EPIC. Lastly, it really put a good use of the 11 year buildup of our heroes. And you really careabout all of them. And everyone does career-best performances. But the star of the show is RDJ. He's always been great as Tony Stark, but I don't think he was as good as he was in this movie. He honestly deserves an Oscar. And don't listen to haters of this movie please. Just watch it and enjoy it."
600,First two hours was hilarious and the best Climax of the world cinema. Russo bros nailed it. It doesn't felt like 3 hrs movie. Undoubtedly best of MCU.
601,Best Superhero movie of all time !!! Very powerless & emotional !!!
602,"Marvel has outdone themselves with endgame , so good with the perfect balance of emotions, action, humour and everything in between, a great movie that will make everyone happy, sad , overwhelmed and this movie seriously deserves to go down as one of the top movie in cinematic history"
603,"It could definitely be improved, but every possible flaw can be totally overlooked because of the 22 film build-up, it seems earned completely for every joke that doesn't land (which isn't many) there are a hundred fan-service moments that make you forget any wrongdoing Following up such an airtight film like Infinity War would be superbly difficult, making the 11 years feel worth it is an achievement and The Russo Brothers deserve praise."
604,Just wow. This is the 1st time I have watched a movie and everybody clapped at the end of it. It is one of if not the best movie I have ever seen. No wonder it is breaking records. I will go and see it again
605,Thanos please Snap this Movie is bad Script writing!
606,"It was not what we expected at all, so so overrated and too long! It could have been 30-40min shorter, and the story was so messy."
607,I'm iron man was the best thing.I must watch movie for a sci-fi and superhero fan.
608,"I don't normally leave reviews, but felt compelled. I'm not giving anything away in the form of a spoiler, only to say that you simply won't be disappointed. It's awesome from start to finish."
609,It was phenomenal...! It was a movie of 3hours and 2 min long but not even a microsecond of movie was boring... (If you're going to watch it then make sure you carry a lots of tissue paper with you...) Simply i loved it
610,"No Spoilers... First time in my life, walked out of the cinema, devastated and full of joy at the same time! A movie that has EVERYTHING and gives EVERYTHING to the fans. An experience that it's worth the long year waiting for it! Good luck to all of you watching the movie."
611,"I'm not being biased as a hard core Marvel fan this movie concluded my childhood and teenage years and that's it , it's an emotional tear jearker . Don't expect it to be as action packed as Infinity War - for me the best super hero movie ever - and to make such sense as Infinity War"
612,"Although I expected much more from this movie, it is still satisfying for me and a decent finale to the avengers series. The movie starts with showing you how the snap affected one of the heroes life. then followed by the remaining avengers trying to protect the remainig world by fighting crime normally as they were doing before Thanos's time. After losing all hope, Ant-man finally returns to the avengers and introduces an idea that might actually work, but one that he can't carry out himself. This leads to the reunion of the avengers team which will spark events that will change the MCU forever. The pacing of the events is not quiet thorough and some prolonged dramatic scenes fall apart and make you feel bored instead of sad. Also the most exciting and effective parts are all packed in the last hour. one of the technical aspects that I did not like was the blurry transition, the camera takes a long time to focus on a character or un-focus from a scene and move on to the next, which really hurt my eye in the IMAX theater. but overall, it was a nice experience and you shouldn't miss this one, infinity war is still the best MCU movie for me but endgame is among the greatest in the series."
613,"I have absolutely no words for how good it was. I 10/10 recommend it, it's happy, sad, but satisfying."
614,"This is it! This is ""THE FIGHT OF OUR LIVES!"" Of course, this was a film on my anticipation list. I didn't put it on the actual list because it was a given. I've been with this extensive universe for 10, going on 11, years. Going into the cinema, I was excited and worried, because I knew that this would be the end of an era and characters. Coming out I was exhausted in the best possible way. I, and the entire audience, were full of emotions both happy and sad. Now let's get into why. POSITIVES! After Infinity War, we were all coming back no matter what! The plot is obviously about reversing what had happened, but all of us are invested in this world, so obviously we were onboard with that. Without spoilers, the course the film takes is fantastic. Although it has a slow start, it was fantastic to slow down and deal with the impact of the Infinity War events and to see these incredible characters cope and to see how the actors performed. Everyone is great, as always. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic. Audiences get to see an impeccable performance from the man that started it all and he is in good company. The core Avenger characters/actors are all great. Where Renner and the writers take Hawkeye is epic. Chris Evans is awesome as Cap and Johansson shines bigtime in the film. Although Josh Brolin's Thanos' appearance is limited, audiences have Infinity War to understand the character! Anthony and Joe Russo return with a punch. Taking risks in the story and action. AND THE ACTION! The final action sequence is easily my favourite action sequence among the MCU movies! The Russo Bros have an incredible ability, that they utilized in The Winter Soldier, where they showcase a character in a small role but make them large. This is what they used in Infinity War and Endgame and that made them perfect to helm to two-parter finale. The Russo Bros also had two shots that made me super emotional. The first is the final shot and it's a tear jerker from an emotional standpoint. And the other occurs as the film wraps up and it showcases how far the MCU has come. They also cameoed more of the Community cast which was hilarious! The entire film flows incredibly well and doesn't at all feel like a 3 Hour epic. This is a praise to the editors of the film, never once making the audience bored in the way they formed the narrative. The visual effects are stunning. In Infinity War I had a problem with the digital image mixed with the live action, but not here. Everything is seamless. From the digital characters to the action. It has got a lot of beautiful and familiar artwork and sets that all blend well together. The costumes are fantastic. Iron Man's and Cap's costumes were fantastic adaptations of the source material. But then again, there were other updated costumes and makeup that were welcomed upgrades. Alan Silvestri's score is used to perfection in the most epic moments! There is so much that I enjoyed and loved, but I love the fact that there are two things that occur in the third act that I have been awaiting for such a long time and the fact that they used both in the epic action sequence was the best thing to occur onscreen for such a long time! NEGATIVES! The problems I have with the film are minor and don't impact my opinion significantly. Most of these are to do with the writing. Like I said before, the film has a slow first act. Once we get past that the film picks up, but it's still there. Again, without spoiling the movie, the film deals with a certain plot device and being a huge fan of that certain device, after the movie finished, I started to deconstruct it and not a lot of it works. But that's nit-picking. The humour between characters works very well, but the humour for the audience not so much. The film takes itself seriously, and that is awesome! It's just that the humour and comedic elements are weak. Thor is awesome in the final act but before then he is used as comedic relief with how the character is displayed and portrayed, and it feels forced and unwarranted. It's unfortunate because Hemsworth was so hilarious in Thor: Ragnarok and those comedic elements flowed well into Infinity War, but not here. And lastly, this is an issue not to do with the movie but the audience. There is a lot of references and cameos to past MCU films, like a lot. And whilst this is fantastic and helps wrap up storylines and character arcs, there will be audience members that don't appreciate the references because they hadn't seen the MCU movies/franchises being referenced. Example; someone that watches The Avengers franchise but doesn't watch the Guardians of the Galaxy movies may not understand certain scenes. Not the Guardians in particular, just an example. CONCLUSION! So, Avengers: Endgame satisfies the biggest MCU fans and Marvel Comics fans with its interpretation of story and character. There are so many epic moments, along with the powerful and sad scenes that will cause a few tears due to a great script and fantastic acting. This isn't my absolute favourite MCU movie, but it's high on the list. It's the Endgame and the stories that the film wraps up are done in an appropriate and epic fashion."
615,Every thing is just so balanced. It was so good that i wanted to rewatch it again after i walked out of the theaters.
616,"The curtain call of the Avengers is entertaining if painfully convoluted and long. Unlike most of its predecessors, ""End Game"" is over done in the same vein as the Star Wars franchise. It's a disappointment compared to most of the prior Marvel films. I own most of those movies on Blue Ray. I will not be purchasing either of the last Avengers films."
617,"What a masterpiece. I'm still in tears, even after 7 hours.. It was better than anything I've imagined."
618,"I'm from Iran and unfortunately due to the sanctions, no theater screens avengers endgame here.so i had to watch it in hdcam. But when i did, it didn't feel bad and i really enjoyed the quality of the movie. But about the film it self: first of all, this film will make you cry and it will break and heal your heart at the same time. It will do it so beautifully that you will never forget it. I watched the endgame 3 times in a row today and honestly I think I'll watch it again. I enjoined Every second of the movie. Thank you marvel, god bless you."
619,I was not disappointed. I wouldn't be bored even if it was 5 hours!
620,"Amusing, but don't expect too much. The previous movie was much better."
621,"So....boring. Bad CGI, lazy writing and just an all out disaster. Huge fan of the MCU, but this is the worst one by far."
622,"First half of movie is very slow, and humor lacking for a marvel movie.. second half is definitely better, but still does not live up to hype"
623,"Loved the movie!! Amazing ending to this entire phase. Just don't want anyone to forget that this entire franchise is a rip-off of DC Comics... Thanos = Darkseid. Captain America = Superman. Avengers = Justice League. Etc, etc, etc. DC will always be first/best above Marvel. Only difference is that DC execs have lacked any vision since they ripped off Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster so many years ago. Get your act together WB/DC.!!!!"
624,"...and pull the hype train over. Amazing fun, stunning spectacle great performances especially RDJ. It's just not the whole sum of its parts. Lots of great parts but not cohesively held. Too much Comedy with one character essentially now just full comedy relief. The most ridiculous coincidences and a couple of plot holes. You will laugh, you will get gut punched and for some you will cry, but then you will wonder what really happened in that 3 hours. Did it need 3 hours? No. Is it better than infinity war? No. Will you enjoy it? Definitely."
625,"As someone who saw the original Superman in 1978 and nearly every superhero movie since then, Endgame is the most EPIC and grandest of them all. Well done Russo brothers! Thank you Marvel for an epic ride."
626,"I won't give a 10/10 because nothing is perfect, but that's the first movie I've sat through that was 3 hours long and wanted to keep going. Maybe waiting a decade for it all to come together was it. Either way, bravo. I'm buying every movie in the Marvel collection to watch with my Son; he just turned 4, so he hasn't been able to watch any of them with me yet. I'm sure he'll love them all."
627,"Yep it's long, but it's packed from start to end. It didn't feel like three hours. There aren't any 'slow' parts, even the non-action bits are full of story so make sure to go to the bathroom before it starts.[換行字元][換行字元]Some story lines are wrapped up, others are left open for the future.

And it will still be worth every penny spent.[換行字元][換行字元]One star is knocked off for a bit of universe continuity weirdness that will be evident when you watch it."
628,"Game of Thrones wins hands down. Even one episode, take episode three series eight as an example.. Note to Russo bros.. see Benioff and Weiss for how to make a an enthralling, gripping, compelling movie.."
629,"Avengers : Endgame was amazing, everything I expected was even better...I don't have the words to explain how amazing it was, I cried, I laughed, I cheered. Incredible ending, this movie was amazing thanks to the directors...go see it...many times...all I have to say is thank you to the cast and crew for 11 years of memories..."
630,"I have been a Marvel Fan since my childhood. It all started with Iron-Man and then flourished by the other movies in MCU! I watched each and every film to date. For a MCU admirer like me ; this film was disappointing to say the least. When infinity war ended, I was literally teared up by the experience I got. It boosted the hype, the anticipation to a new level! I was counting on the finale film to be the best I have ever seen in the MCU so far. But that dream, that wish of mine got shattered! Why? There are so many reasons behind it! Slow pace till the time travel sequences kicked up, lack of cohesiveness between the characters, not duly written script, lesser emotional impact ; all of these made the film less enjoyable for me. The only thing that saved it from being doomed for me is the Last 1 hour, the climax battle scenes are beautifully made. To have all the superheroes in one place and give proper screen times to everyone is a daunting task. They handled it pretty well! The performances especially from RDJ was memorable and touching at the same moment. Overall a decent film for my liking and for my expectancy that I had after The last film. It Should have been way way better. All of the True Marvel fans deserved it."
631,What Marvel Studios has accomplished over the past 22 films will be studied for generations to come. This movie is a perfect bow on the whole damn thing. Giving fans what they want while also making a film that honors the past without ignoring the future.
632,"Sums up all the Marvel movies! Interesting from start to finish! Will make you wanna laugh, cry, shout out loud and stand up and applaud! Best Marvel movie ever!!! 👍🏽"
633,"This movie was awful; the acting was abhorrent, the special effects looked like a spy kids movie, and the plot was verging on completely ludicrous. I was ready for a simple popcorn flick, but this movie committed the worst crime of all; it was horrendously boring.[換行字元][換行字元]This film had zero depth, the characters were two dimensional, and the jokes mostly fell flat for me. The actors looked bored, and at times there was more green screen than the Star Wars prequels. Worse still, there were times where it felt like certain actors weren't even on set at the same time as the others, and it was all edited together afterwards.[換行字元][換行字元]I wish I had the infinity glove so I could click my fingers and cut this movie by 50% of its runtime."
634,"An epic end to the this Infinity Saga..It couldn't have been any better..To all those fans around the globe who have been waiting for this moment. I have to say this is worth Ur wait, this is the moment, this is the Endgame"
635,"F..., i was just like a child again. Crying like a baby. This movie derserves the title Endgame!!! Simply outstanding! Overwhelming!"
636,The end that a saga of this magnitude needes! Very nice plot that doesn't let you get bored.
637,Yes I reviewed this already but people giving this movie less than 9 obviously aren't vested in these characters and are just to anti marvel to see just how good this movie was..... as far as being any kind realistic the movie starts with dear Mr fantasy.....
638,We can't say anything to this awesome work these russo brothers did the work very perfect
639,"WOW! Simply wow! What. A. Film! I can't start to describe all the emotion throughout this film! One minute you are laughing then the next you are in tears! (I ain't ashamed to say 4 times that happened to me!) this is in my opinion the very best film I have ever seen and potentially the best film I will ever see! Words can't describe how amazing this is! Incredible! Amazing! Unbelievable! Fantastic! WOW! Loved it! Absolute loved it!!! All I can say to all the cast, the writers, everyone involved in this journey for the last 11 years is Thank You! Thank you ever so much for this! #DontSpoilTheEndgame"
640,Movie out of this world ... brilliant casting and fantastic roles. Three hours movie length but didn't feel like it was that much long. Emotional dialogues which made me sad. Me and my husband loved it.
641,"This movie was a masterpiece, let's make it the best movie in the world by making it the first movie on the top list!"
642,Ive never seen anything like this ever. Truly an amazing experience Wish i could watch it again for the first time 10/10[換行字元][換行字元]My first review okay
643,"This could've been sooo much better, some great scenes and then the horrific route taken with the characters of Thor and Hulk! Some nice touches and fight scenes but left disappointed. Totally agree with so many others that infinity war was the better movie."
644,Expected more much more as a fan I have continue sly fallowed the franchise wanted a better way of story telling much better story line it felt like every world from different song in a same album glued together in the worst way possible
645,"Imagine you have to write Endgame. You would have to find a way to reconcile several things: the expectations of the audience, the continuity not only with the other movies, but with future projects and past comic book ideas, the actors that just won't come back whatever the reason, America's unhealthy obsession with political correctness, the wishes of the producers, the wishes of the director, the wishes of the people paying for the movie. It is an nearly impossible task. As a solution to this conundrum, Avengers: Endgame was really decent. It has character build up, exposition - maybe too much of it, foreshadowing, great action scenes, great emotional scenes, great acting. It got rid of all the leaving actors in a very nice way for their characters. It solved the problem of the death of so many living creatures in a way that didn't mean everything was simply undone or redone or forgotten.[換行字元][換行字元]That being said, all the characters in this film are dumb. I mean, really dumb. They have lightning fast reactions, but their solutions are ridiculous. The whole concept of the solution, which I don't want to spoil, lends itself to improvement.; it was not spent in this story. Also, there is a key moment that ends (heh) it all... it could have been done minutes before. All the elements where already there. And there are so many logic holes in the plot that my mind just reels from thinking about it.[換行字元][換行字元]Bottom line: a very beautiful film for your heart. Doesn't do your brain any good."
646,What a huge disappointment. Hulk is a wimp. Thor is a fat drunk. No fight scenes. I am a huge Marvels fan I could not have been more disappointed with this movie. Anyone saying this was great needs to be evaluated.
647,"After 2 days I've changed my rating from an 8 to a 6. When I reflect back on it, there were only 3 good scenes in the entire movie: Black Widow's death, Tony Shark's death, and Cap dancing with Peggy. First 2 hours were boring. Battle scene good but not spectacular. But I did like those 3 scenes!!!!"
648,"Although it was a satisfying ending of the same characters in MCU, other important protagonists get sidelined in ridiculous ways. The ending was very emotional, but the road there was a bumpy one. The Russo's did not capture the magic they did with Infinity War, but I guess it was good enough."
649,The amazing three hours. I wasn't bored for a minute. Thanos is amazing again. Captain America is best hero. The final battle was fantastic. It is emotional and incredible movie. The Russo Brothers are gods. Avengers Assamble
650,"To all the people who rated this 1 or 2 stars...WHAT MOVIE did you watch? Just to hear Cap say ""Avengers Assemble"" alone makes this epic...remember the question Mr. Hand asked his class when so many failed the test? This is a great film, action, humor, emotion...all on display..."
651,This can only be described as perfect. What a ride and what a beautiful story. It's simply the most beautiful masterpiece in cinema history.
652,"One of the best movies I've seen in a while! I loved every single piece of this movie and I would highly recommend seeing it! Following on from Infinity War, Endgame carry's on nicely from Infinity War which is an amazing addition. Having be the last Avengers movie in the saga this movie finishes off well and leaves the cherry on top for the saga. Visuals where on point as well as cast and sfx. This movie in my opinion is definitely a movie I would watch again from beginning to end. Absolutely amazing!"
653,I have never seen any movie like Avengers Endgame in my life . It Is the most unique and ambitious movie I have seen in my entire life . Endgame end's the first Era of the MCU Perfectly . 10/10 A+
654,One of the best movies in the superhero genre. A must watch for everyone.
655,The worst mcu movie of all time. Don't understand all the hype this movie is getting.
656,"GENERAL CONSENSUS (BAD, OK, GOOD, EXCELLENT): Excellent film and very good ending to the Tony Stark Marvel Era Saga."
657,Movie is very slow in 1st half. Action is very less. Not as expected
658,"First of it will remove your stress if you are thinking about what will be the next or what will thanos do. That's it. Beside that, this movie is almost like crap. Sometimes they want to be serious, sometimes funny, sometimes emotional. What a mess. They had created a hype by Infinity War and now break all the records. I think all credit goes to Infinity war. They should have to take time to write a good screenplay. I guess they don't take time because the hype will be damaged. And now give the people a crap."
659,In my opinion this was a huge dissappointment for me. The movie lacks of action and full of irrational content. Its very slow and boring. First half was unnecessary and second half is below par. Im so sad that nearly nothing significant happened in whole 180 minutes. I was expecting the same vibe as infinity war or dark knight but this was more like age of ultron.
660,"Eleven-year wait is finally over. The Endgame hit theatres on April 24th, and the word ""hit"" might be the best way to put it. The culmination of a comic-book phenomenon called ""The Avengers"" is set to become the most successful film in terms of box-office gross, as well as be generally regarded as the best comic-book movie ever made.[換行字元][換行字元]The story takes place in the so-called MCU, a universe where all the superheroes reside. Established 11 years ago with the release of the first film, The Iron Man, at that time tricky move has proven to be a resounding success and changed the lives of everyone involved. Marvel managed to build a universe so mesmerizing it has made fans always coming back for more. With the last film closing the chapter, it was Marvel's responsibility to do justice to this franchise. And it seems that they didn't disappoint.[換行字元][換行字元]The film plays on a sentimental note, leaving viewers with a nostalgic feeling. This is done by referencing to the past movies, and even revisiting the old sets. Slightly less action-packed than the former Infinity War, The Endgame focuses on the journey of the original Avengers, but still, or perhaps because of this, manages to take many surprising turns. It is nothing new that the stories of some of these characters are coming to an end, but don't make this prevent you from going to see this film! The death sequences are dealt with graciously, avoiding overused clichés. They leave you feeling heart-broken, but also satisfied with the epic conclusion.[換行字元][換行字元]The only think that I find to be irritating was the song repertoire. Although the songs usually fit the scenes in which they appeared, they didn't tie the story together, making it a little chaotic and inconsistent.[換行字元][換行字元]All in all, The Endgame is an achievement in both, cinematography and storytelling, and is a must-see for every cinephile."
661,This movie is total lit u will witness all kinds of human emotions possible even if u are a tough punk who feels he can't feel anything it is the finale of all 21 movies a story telling saga of greatness avoid spoilers it is the best movie there can ever be if you are not watching it i u are missing to be part of something really big at the end thank u avengers thank u marvel i have just no words to describe what I guys gaved and delivered worth it totally
662,"Is a must see in my book 👍, the best movies i ever seen."
663,"I have seen this movie about 6 times (including opening night) and I love it as much as the first time! I have just been scrolling through reviews and could not believe some of the negative reviews on here! It has been called boring and some posters here have said the positive reviews have come from ""sponsors"". No, the positive reviews here came from a devoted fan base that have watched 22 movies for over a decade and are emotionally connected to the characters and the storyline! This movie IS the best ""fan service"" to ever be created! I really do suggest you do watch this movie if you are a fan of the MCU and not listen to these pretentious ""critics"" who only like art house indie films and hate on everything made by a studio! If you are a fan of the MCU and have followed along the span of 22 movies and love the characters then this movie will run you through the gamut of emotions! I have never seen a more interactive audience in my life. Laughs and cheers at all the right moments and dead silence in the emotional ones. Not a dry eye in the crowd when the lights came on and no one was embarrased because everyone was on the same journey whether you were 7 or 57. My opinion may be biased because I LOVE these movies but most posters on here are down right cynical and will try to find something wrong with anything! I only post positive reviews because even if I don't like something it doesn't mean that someone can't like it and I don't want my opinion to sway their curiosity. Life is subjective in general but I try and only focus on the positive!"
664,There is not a single mistake everything was perfect the soundtrack the cgi the acting the lines everything was perfect
665,"Thor's take on ""the dude"" was the best part of the movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Too long and sentimental[換行字元][換行字元]Most of the focus is on the original avengers which is good but many of the storylines were just not very exciting[換行字元][換行字元]I would wait to see this on video"
666,What a way to finish this 11 years 22 movies build up.
667,Very very good movie Thank you Rose brothers for create this movie
668,"Very poor movie filled with plot holes. May be they wanted to release the movie soon and hence decided, lets have a grand CGI fight, some humor, use complicated words and hype it so much that people will say it was good (May be pay the critics?) It goes in the list of bad comic book movies. If your only exposure to comics is through Marvel movies, may be you will like it. I think most people will watch it just to see how they attain closure to the fantastic movie timeline, time and money spent is not going to worth it though."
669,"The first third of the film was not entertaining Too much talking, too much waiting and no real events I liked the humor but that was it at this point The second part was nice and overall the best of it The third was fun to watch although overall expected, particularly at the climax and how it ended"
670,"The 22-movie Infinity Saga of the MCU comes to a close in its best film yet. Avengers: Endgame is everything we wanted and more. It's hilarious, it's action-packed, and has one of the best scenes I've ever seen in a superhero film, let alone any movie. It's full of fan service and nods to the previous films. I don't really have any issues with the film, at least those that are not spoilers anyway. If I had one non-spoiler issue with the film it would be fact that the first hour is a bit slow but afterwards it picks up and never stops. Really any complaints I have with this film is shut out by everything else. My complaints are just nitpicks. It fits its three hour runtime very well and provides a highly satisfying end to the 11 year saga that began with Iron Man in 2008. The MCU has set a new direction and I can't wait to see what happens next."
671,One of the best comic movie ever made after infinity war.Lots of emotions.Epic
672,"Let's all take a moment to be honest here. All along the way, 22 films worth of storytelling, we were all waiting for a moment that didn't live up to the hype. there's been this sense of dread that all of this time and love for all of these characters was going to end in disappointment. Here's the honesty - I was wrong, you were wrong, we were wrong. Never before in the history of filmmaking have we seen 22 films crescendo in such a beautifully complex and wonderfully perfect way. Never. If you haven't seen them all, do that first, it's with it. If you just haven't seen Endgame yet GO but bring some tissues because it's going to hit you in some good and rough ways! I'm excited to see what comes next."
673,"Nonetheless, america has loss..... No Animation or CGI can safe america. Hail Stanley"
674,"So a handful of heroes fight all the way to the climactic end of the movie, and then they lose the chance to finish what they started. I am not going to spoil it, but watching a million CGI characters appear on both sides was like letting all the air out of the tires. All the dramatic build-up was lost when it became a billions against billions battle.[換行字元][換行字元]Which brings up the fact that at least 90 minutes of this movie is spent on boring scenes of various Avengers feeling depressed about the death of the heroes, and going to support group meetings. We get it. The Avengers are depressed. This could have been covered in fifteen minutes or less in a group meeting. We did not need to follow each Avenger through their depressing trip down memory lane. Thank God Ant Man came back from the quantum universe and got the ball rolling!![換行字元][換行字元]Unfortunately, Thor becomes the punchline for jokes throughout the movie. Since Captain Marvel is the new #1 hero, they had to power down Thor by turning him into a drunken hobo. The Incredible Hulk has spent the past three movies (Thor Ragnarok, Infinity War, & this one) in permanent erectile dysfunction, and he continues to be a zero in this movie. Thor and the Hulk are just here to be the focus of comedy as has-beens. Even Bruce Banner as a scientist gets slapped down. Michael Douglas and the Pym Particles have to fix what Bruce Banner fails to do. It is a very sad way for two of Marvel's earliest and most powerful heroes to end their game.[換行字元][換行字元]There are a lot of good moments in Endgame. Most of them happen when the small crew of Avengers is trying to find the original gems. Then the battle when it is just the small group against Thanos is excellent. It was building up to a great ending, Captain America & Iron Man defeating Thanos, against all odds. Even Thor was redeeming himself in the battle! That is how this Marvel Comics masterpiece could have ended. But they had to throw in the billions of CGI characters and turn it into a big circus act... Too bad. Less was more."
675,I watched every single marvel movie. And endgame definitely has everything I wanted to see. Impressive ending for a ten year journey. I can't wait for another ten year. Thank you marvel. For this excellent masterpiece.
676,"Funny, Emotional and overall just a fun time, The latest entry into marvels cinematic universe is an overall satisfying end of an era for fans of the saga."
677,Not a fan of superhero movies but Avengers: Endgame changed my mind!
678,The movie starts of with immediate heartbreak. The movie is well paced and edited. MVC (MOST VALUABLE CHARACTER) is captain ameirca. He stole the movie and it was more of an captain America movie. The movie does a good service to the 6 Og Avengers and doesnt leave a moment where your crying laughing or aweing. Its amazing.
679,"I'll make it short , If you are still deciding either to go watch the movie or not then , don't go ... wait till the DVD release and watch it on a Friday night, after work , while you are so tired , sitting on your couch and you will have a nice nap at the first 1.5 hours of the movie then you will wake up like you missed nothing at all and you might enjoy the rest of the movie . The movie as they announced before is completely different than the infinity war , it's the difference between the east and the west plus if you really care about the previous MCU movies and the characters in them, you might also avoid watching that movie at all. The only way to watch that movie without getting disappointed is to forget that it's related to the MCU or Marvel comics ! I've advised you ..."
680,"Avengers: Endgame is so epic and grandiose that it's impossible not to at least crack a smile during it's conclusion. Surprisingly though, the movie is at it's best when quietly self-reflecting on the journey of some of it's main characters. I'm impressed with how well the Russo's manage to make the story feel personal amidst a collection of characters and universe ending stakes.[換行字元][換行字元]Seeing this on opening night with a cinema full of people laughing (and some crying) was a rare experience. When the credits finally hit, a friend turned to me and said 'it's the end of an era.' Nothing quite like what Kevin Feige and the Russo's have pulled of here has been done before, and I'm unsure if it will ever be done so well again."
681,Legendary film F F Fkfdjxjjdjj ddjdjdbe. Dbdjndjx mdmdd dmd dk dkd djdn D
682,Story line is not good..lots of plot hole...Forcely added emotional scene..Good part of movie is thanos..

684,A very good and recommended movie ever! Plot twist and unexpected ending. Full of Joy and happiness and also tears. Good job Marvel! Happy watching for everyone.
685,"Most cringe worthy superhero movie I've seen. I was eye-rolling most of the time. Near the end I was just hoping for it to finally end. I mean, where to begin, is totally messy and nonsensical! All the time travel doesn't make sense at all. After all the hype I'm so mad at how bad it was."
686,All characters of mcu is in this masterpiece you will fill thrilled last 8 minutes. Best movie made ever. Ty #Russobrothers #RobertDowneyJr. #Chrisevans #Stanlee #Mcu ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

689,"Wonderfully written script, and Chris Hemsworth must take the Oscar for supporting this thor performance."
690,Wow... All i can say is that the movie ended my entire childhood in the most perfect way!! It kept you on your feet the whole way through!! Marvel somehow manages to add comedy to the most intense situations. its Awesome!! The battle scene was out of this world!! I just... wow.. Thank you marvel. I love you 3000!!! ROBERT DOWN JUNIOR WON THE HERO OF THE YEAR AWARD THIS YEAR LAST WEEK AT THE MTV MOVIE AND TV AWARDS!!
691,"Let me first tell you that I am a big fan of the marvel movie franchise. Never read any comic book. I generally enjoy superhero movies.[換行字元][換行字元]This review would be disliked but I have to say this, this was the worst marvel movie after iron Man 2 for me. Some movies have loopholes in their script but this movie has some script in the loopholes. I guess this movie is getting such high reviews(near fight club and Lord of the rings) as people are emotional about the characters and they would think with their heart and not their brain. But if you actually think about the movie, that is , take your brain with you to the theatre, you would start observing the huge loopholes. And I do want to clear it out that I am not a person who is very picky about the story. I accept some flaws in a movie. But in this movie there are so many flaws that it becomes hardly acceptable. It was so bad that it killed all my interest in future superhero movies."
692,"The movie is perfect, it gave the fans what they wanted.i"
693,"Last year I watched Infinity War on opening day in theatres and was amazed by it. Of course it was flawed and those flaws did bother me but it was still incredible. I just watched Endgame and this film made Infinity War look like Thor: The Dark World.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is a stellar film, through its spectacular visuals, charming characters, epic fight scenes and engrossing narrative. It is a film that shouldn't be possible. If someone told me about this film ten years ago and said it was actually great, I would have laughed in their face. Yet somehow a film of this scale, ten years in the making, was masterfully executed. There was a lot I expected to happen that did but there was tons more I never thought would happen that completely caught me by surprise which is what I truly love about this film.[換行字元][換行字元]The first two acts were great, they drove the story forward and gave us some great character moments. The first scene in the film, gave me the first out of many tears that would shed throughout the film. Honestly I have never cried this much in a movie and I would have never thought this would be the film that would make me do that. However the first two acts were flawed, there were a few pacing issues here and there, some problems with the narrative in terms of developing some character moments and other issues.[換行字元][換行字元]However by the third act those problems were completely forgotten. The third act was so grand and epic and was one of the best final hours I have ever witnessed in a movie ever. I would love to talk about it but I am keeping things spoiler three. Just know that you could never imagine how effing spectacular it is. I certainly didn't.[換行字元][換行字元]The ending in particular was emotional, heartfelt and immensely engrossing. It was a well deserved pay-off to these last ten years of films and a great satisfying end to it all. Overall Avengers: Endgame is a film that not only surpassed my expectations, but is also a flawed masterpiece. To this day I would have never thought I would want to give a film this flawed an 11/10."
694,This is an Incredible and Unpredictable Ending. The way of screenplay and the direction ( No Words for this ) must watch movie. I enjoyed alooooooooot. Perfect Ending more than 100%. Thank you MARVEL..!
695,"Wow .. ok the story is straight forward ,yes sometimes too much to process and if u think about it you might find flows but the main thing that made that movie great is just how easily it makes you fell every emotion the scene wants you to feel , you want to cry you will cry or at least feel terribly sad u want to laugh , be exited you will 100% . Also the amount of references is a a lot . Honestly I don't think they (MCU) can top that at least on the emotional scale ."
696,"What an epic end to a 10 year saga of the MCU being a true fan makes you appreciate all the splendid details in the movie with on point writing and visuals, its a true marvel of a movie 😉."
697,Ignore those bad and good reviews ! Just buy the ticket and go watch it for yourself ! I guarantee it would worth 3 hours of your life !
698,"Part of the Journey is the End. An absolute triumph of cinema. The perfect conclusion, and undeniably the most emotional MCU film to date. I cried from start to finish. You can have The Godfather, Titanic, The Shawshank Redemption, or any of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but to me this is the greatest movie of all time and I will never concede that it is not. Something like this will never be accomplished so perfectly tragic and beautiful at such a grand scale ever again. It's a momentous achievement in cinema, and I fear it will be taken for granted when it's all said and done."
699,3 hours of crap. One guy says time is not linear and damn! Quantum physics solved.
700,Best movie ever and very good movie. My favorite movie ever when it come out on dvd I will buy it.
701,"After the years of a big buildup what a big let down . There was plot hole after plot hole and little action scenes. Thanos was like a little girl in comparison to infinity war . Captain Marvel one of the most powerful in the galaxy was on annual leave only there for little bits . The Hulk was a disappointment. Thoese rating a high score are just not watching the movie at all .[換行字元][換行字元]I have to agree with this statement, plot holes all over the movie.. but in the other hand if you like a visual appealing movie and you are a Tony Stark/Iron Man fan well i guess its not a completly waste.[換行字元][換行字元]In other words, I wouldnt pay to see it again."
702,"Beyond words, amazing movie. Great finale to Phase 3 of MCU."
703,"This movie does not stop delivering. You cannot miss this one. I say every MCU movie is better than the last but trust me when I say that this is the one you've been waiting for. I didn't think they would be able to top Infinity War but it's twice the movie. It's funny, it's sad, it's awesome with scenes that will make you want to throw your fists in the air. The entire cast gives their greatest performance yet. I was very angry when Star-Lord fudged everything in the last movie but if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have this masterpiece.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you Marvel."
704,Overabundant. Excessive. Confused. Too long. Flat. Even boring.
705,"Some scenes could have been edited down a bit.. But why NOT make it EPIC, with one more joke or two? Also, would have like more from certain characters and less of others. More action would always have been nice too. But when all was said and done, this movie going experience was just about as good as it gets... IF your a Marvel fan, and have been following it. If not then it wasn't made for you YET, go catch up and watch the last phase. Amazing Time! Impressive acting caught me by surprise too. And the pay offs are great fun."
706,"First of all, the action in this movie is the best I've seen in any Marvel movie. It beats out some iconic scenes trust me. All the actors in this film did amazing jobs. From when we first see them to now you can see the character growth that has developed in them. This film is three-hours-and-two-minutes long but really you never feel it. You're so engaged in this movie and the characters that the time just flies by so quickly and every second in this film is important. I feel like if they got rid of anything in this film it would take away from something. That something being the emotion in this film. There is so much emotion in this film that even one scene being removed would've ruined it. In the end, Avengers: Endgame is a great wrap up and final goodbye to this part of the MCU. Just make sure if you have a soul to bring tissues with you."
707,"Amazing movie, blows every marvel movie before it out of the water for me. Infinity War and Winter Soldier were amazing, but the amount of suspense and emotion put into this one beats both of them combined."
708,"Avengers: Endgame is meant to be Marvel Studios's god-tier magnum opus that finishes off 11 years of buildup on the highest note possible. Does it succeed? No, not not even close. This movie has some of the worst pacing in this entire franchise, some of the most contrived writing, and some of the biggest plot holes the franchise has ever created. And none of that was something that was made by accident. All of that was achieved solely because the writers/directors wanted to have something in the movie so badly, they ignored their own continuity. They shoved moments and gags that would be sort-of funny or sort-of interesting as standalone moments, but would fall apart when compared to the rest of the continuity. This movie is trying to be like Back to the Future, Lord of the Rings, Inception, and Interstellar at the same time, but manages to not even be half as good as either of them. The only real saving grace in this movie is that there is finally some finality to some of the characters, which was something the MCU always avoided doing because they always used the characters by thinking what will put more money in their valets, not what will have more heart. Oh, and you might be wondering why I don't mention Thanos? Well, no spoilers, but if you expect to be as impressed by him as you were in the previous movie, you're in for disappointment. Overall, this movie was not worth the wait, and this movie will not age well after you'll re-watch it multiple times and see why it's so fundamentally broken.[換行字元][換行字元]4 out 10."
709,"There is no exaggeration here when I say that is this the most Epic finale of any movie series I have ever seen, so elegant, so justifying it's purpose and so good in paying tribute to every single movie that preceded it. A Movie that explores the entire emotional spectrum of a human being, that easily takes you from tears to laughs. I am not sure that there will be a movie that comes out soon that would take me through remotely similar experience. Job well done, I wished the movie would never end , but "" every journey must come to an end "" and this was the best I have experienced so far.[換行字元][換行字元]Thanks for everyone who has been working on this enterprise, thanks for the minds who wrote that script and big thanks to the cast who are heroes is real life to give people one hell of 3 divine hours of entertainment."
710,If you invested in all of the films that came before it then you will probably be very happy. Are there plot holes? Sure. Is anything in the movie probable at all in the real world? No. It's a movie. Go into it with an open mind and enjoy the ride. Nice job Russo's.
711,What a movie. I cried and laught. This was Epic. Just Epic. I want To see iT again.
712,"Is it really over? Still couldn't believe all my super heros are leaving the big screen. At first, I was worried what the script would be like? Three hours movie? It seems long... However, after watching the movie, 3 hours not enough, wish it is longer! Because so many characters and so many stories that need conculsion. It is unbelievable how many great actors/actress are involved in this movie, many of them just appear for a few seconds. There are so many loyal Marvel fans around the world. It is indeed an awesome franchise!"
713,I was shocked because of how wonderful movie it is. The same places and characters shined as it expected.
714,"I get it, there is so much of the story to be told and so many character arcs to sum up, but the movie dragged at times. Some parts even seemed downright silly (i.e. Thor). The movie had its share of great moments. I especially loved Captain America's and Tony Stark's storylines/payoffs. Everyone else's? Not so much. I don't know why Marvel didn't include an intermission! Holding it for 3 hours, seriously? That can make for a messy endgame!"
715,There are questions that needed to be asked and answered but I guess Id have to go along with it when the future comes... Beautiful...
716,This movie is AMAZING! Perfect conclusion to the MCU. I'm one of those people who doesn't give a 10 unless I believe the movie is perfect. I believe that it is impossible to make a perfect movie but this movie challenged that belief.
717,"The film has too many references to previous Marvel films, and is not friendly to those who are not Marvel fans. General audiences may easily get confused: what is this and why is that? The story is not original either. We have seen too many time-travel films, such as Back to the Future and Days of Future Past. This film does not offer anything new. Besides, the last thirty minutes are kind of redundant, and the overall running time is unnecessarily long."
718,It's an incredible movie...make sure to go pee before it's starts. all emotions pack in a 3h ride. Amazing!
719,Trying to avoid spoilers while expressing why so much of this film is just a fan service dues ex machina is just too difficult. A disappointing and cheap end to a decade's worth of popcorn films.
720,"Thanos thought he won't be defeated, his love for power made him lose, and all glory went to the Avengers, this is the greatest movie of all time."
721,Totally amazed by this movie. Best movie of the Era!!!
722,"As a Marvel fan I had my hopes up at 100% for this film being so invested throughout the years with the characters and their stories and I gotta say I was not disappointed at all![換行字元][換行字元]This is the only film I've seen in theaters more than once and for great reasons, it truly doesn't disappoint. This and Infinity War were the only films where I physically automatically jumped out of my seat when something epic would happen and the callbacks to other movies were fan-service to the max![換行字元][換行字元]The plot is ridiculous in its premise and does require more suspension of disbelief than all of the other Marvel movies that came before this one and it executes it's the plot perfectly with enough high-stakes and humor to be a fully immersive experience.[換行字元][換行字元]This truly is a once in a lifetime film event and is the perfect ending to a near-perfect saga."
723,"I was pessimistic and fatigued with Marvel in the past few years, but Endgame is the most enjoyable movie since the original standalone films way back when the MCU was first being set up. Where Infinity War was lacking in terms of tension, Endgame picks up the slack, with tightly bound scenes and interesting twists and turns. Characters act in logical ways and it is simply a joy experiencing and sharing in their time on screen. This was a far more fulfilling experience than I expected and I was really won over by the fantastic acting and the meticulous attention to detail in every scene."
724,"Now Marvel cannot afford a slip, in fact they are the only company that makes movie profits with super profits. When Warner Brosses can allow to divide the Fantastic Beasts not into 3 planned parts, but into 5, in the end they get a part with a low payback due to its filleriness. Yes, Marvel, in my opinion, blundered Captain Marvel with k \ f, it came out very weak in terms of plot, and the graphon was already tired of the 3-4 luminous flash, the film could have pulled out the cosmos, but apparently they didn't have enough money for it detailed display I turn to reviews on the Avengers. The finale, I watched them a week after the premiere, when my friend was able to watch them earlier, I asked him not to spoil and the only thing he said about this: - Avengers 4 is the best I've seen in my life! After watching the film, I stayed at about the same opinion. I'll tell you why. You just need to watch this movie and enjoy it and great work on the little things in it. The film is rich not only in multi-million grafonium, but also in the canonical caste of famous actors, the plot in turn is not as simple as it seemed at first glance, there is a lot of fan service in the film, but this is understandably an era of infinity stones that connected 20 films gone, the saga of infinity is complete, they tried to do it not just pathetically, but beautifully pleasing everyone, they did it with a probability of 100% if you spent at least 10 minutes on the possible plot of 4 parts, it could be in the film, yes surely come true not all theories and predictions, the film is able to surprise (it is very difficult to describe it without spoilers). The twists and turns in the film are so unexpected in places that you do not believe to the last that they went for it. However, the film has a general picture and it looks like you would like to see it, Marvel made it so that I can say with confidence that it couldn't have been better, although again there are questions to the story, but without these blunders there wouldn't be a film As for the tears, I read reviews from other critics and they wrote that they cried a lot on Avengers 4, but I would not say that there were many such moments, but being crying not sentimentally 3 or even 4 times, and most moments when tears came to light in captivity in the first third of the film, but Threat flowed at the end of the film, but they made the right choice, someone came back, someone left, and someone stayed, surely those who left us would be missed, but their end was not just a logical ending, no, their story was told and they were ""let go"" I would give the film the highest rating, it certainly deserves gold, 10 \ 10. I am also pretty sure that in 1-2 weeks the film will overtake the Avatar and become the highest grossing in the history, the film is again worthy. I would like to add more about the ""scene after the credits"", but it isn't, but at the end, after all the captions, when you sit in an empty hall and try to comprehend the film, the sound of a hammer blow on metal sounds, at this point your brain is broken, you have many theories and you do not understand whether it is a reference to the origins of Marvel or a hint of the future ..."
725,"The amount of flaws in the plot and the amount of cliche heroism make you cringe your way through this stink fest. The fact that ANY film based on comics can get a rating higher than a 9 is a travesty and an insult to movies actually deserving of an almost perfect rating.[換行字元][換行字元]It's also a direct correlation to the dumbed down audiences that hollywood panders to now.[換行字元][換行字元]These cookie cutter Marvel movies HAVE TO STOP at some point right? RIGHT?!!! I hope this is the beginning of the end. If you rated this a 9, right along The Godfather - you are completely insane."
726,"I loved the movie soo much especially in 3D, it was everything that we didn't think we want but we need. The ending was in fact satisfying as Chris Evans said in an interview. This the only movie I rated it 10 because it gave us everything we expected and more."
727,"Even though it isn't a happy ending for some but as Robert Downey jr. aka Tony Stark said it doesn't always roll on that way. Part of the journey is the end. No journey is complete without an ending, and Avengers: Endgame brought to the infinity saga the perfect one.[換行字元][換行字元]We saw that the six initial Avengers (the OGs) have evolved each in his own way. Indeed, Tony Stark who's gone from a selfish playboy to a hero who sacrificed his life for the survival of mankind, and he's become a very lovable and protective father and husband. Steve Rodgers has shown us that he is worthy of lifting Mjolnir ( as we would have expected since his scene in Avengers: Age of Ultron where he is trying to lift the hammer and was the closest to succeed ) and by doing so, it shows us that Dr. Abraham Erskine was right all along: Captain America is really pure of heart. Also, by going back in time to continue living his life where he stopped and had this dance with his One is a special and emotional scene. It gives to the character a well deserved and peaceful retirement. He couldn't have missed his date for much longer after all. Now Thor, as we all know, went through a lot of pain; his path wasn't the easiest. Indeed losing most of his people, had his family killed ( except Odin who died peacefully ) and the idea of losing against the mad titan made the god of thunder miserable. But after his confrontation with his now dead mother, and some pep talk offered by Rocket, he regained hope. In addition, by lifting his old hammer we can see that Thor was still worthy even after he battled with anger and depression. Hulk has gone from a wild, angry uncontrollable beast to a more intelligent and sentimental one. Bruce Banner finally gained control over the monster inside of him. The story of Natasha Romanoff is a sadder story, in fact she turned from a lone wolf to a wolf who works better with a pack. If you didn't get my metaphor, Black Widow didn't trust anybody. She was always vigilant with the others. But the Avengers gave her a family, they were the only people she could trust. So sacrificing her self for the better good of her new familia is a huge changing for the character. And at last but not at least Clint Barton aka Hawkeye aka Ronin. He turned from a caring father to an assassin who's gone rogue. After his family turned to dust, his only goal was killing bad guys, but when hope came knocking to his door he was ready to sacrifice himself to bring his family back."
728,"That was an awesome movie, but an unpopular opinion for me I enjoyed infinity war more than Endgame and I don't know why but it was awesome"
729,"Never EVER, Never BEFORE. Every Journey has an end, one can never have or expect a better ENDING."
730,"Just like my headline says. Watch this masterpiece for the love of God! This and infinity war are on totally different levels to any other super hero film. And this goes one level better than infinity war, absolutely fantastic."
731,"The story line was mostly boring, the characters (banner and Thor) were embarrassing and I missed the funny dialogues."
732,"The movie is nothing less than a 10, if anyone says otherwise they crazy. I mean it's so cool, it has everything. A true mcu fan will most definitely cry because its simply amazing......"
733,"I just installed IMDB app for rating this movie and writing my views .... this is my first review for any movie ....first of all WoW!! just wow.... hands down greatest movie of our generation ....only movie that made me cry , happy ... literally i get goosebumps when i think about this movie ... Robert Downey jr is the most finest actors we have , i booked another ticket also this weekend becoz this is worth watching again n again....many scenes will give u chills many will surprise you .....now i can officially say that my childhood is over now ... i m sad emotional but at the end of the day i m happy and proud tht i m in this generation and grows up with these heros ..... love to marvel from india 💖"
734,"Unreal. If I can laugh, pray, and cry in 3 hours.....sign me up."
735,There were a few surprises but just about everything that was predicted happened. The entire movie was preaching and pushing agendas like previous Marvel movies. There were only 3-4 spots that hit on the agendas but they didn't overwhelm the movie. About 5-10 minutes in it dragged a little (really the only time you can go to a bathroom break and not miss anything. Worth the money to go see and worth your time. It's a long movie but doesn't feel like it most of the time. They tried to address all of the outstanding items. Not the best Marvel or even the best Avengers movie but I'm glad I saw it.
736,"The action sequences are always the same, the plots are always the same, every Marvel movie in this cinematic universe was exactly the same. All 22 of them were the same movie.[換行字元][換行字元]There is no creativity, just massive budgets, a star studded cast, as much cgi as possible, boring dialogue, poor character development, no deeper meaning whatsoever, poor cinematography, eye popping special effects, and watered down violence that is on par with the old power rangers.[換行字元][換行字元]These movies can't even hold a flame to the Dark Night trilogy which deal with the human condition, psychology, are immensely quotable, have real violence, and are more than guys in tights dancing around triumphantly saying the corniest lines ever spoken in the history of cinema.[換行字元][換行字元]George Lucas made Star Wars to sell toys, and these Marvel movies are no different.

737,"Truly THRILLING ,EXITING ,ENTERTAINING ,HEARTWARMING ,PLEASING ,FASCINATING and ACHING ."
738,"It was straight up a huge disappointment, and a really bad ending to a great saga"
739,The avengers endgame isn't trash movie to get 1 star come on people have done so much work and you are just ruining it cause you havent wrote the scenario or havent worked in their crew to change everything like you wanted to see. dont be blind stupids lots of hard work and millions of dollars is invested in this movie at list it deserves 5 star .
740,"Yeah I guess you are right : This movie is a total mess with complete insignificant plot. I don't know what happened in the Russo's head while making the scenario. They must have hung their ideas with something like : We must satisfy our fans and give'em everything they've ever dream to see in a super-hero movie. Such an idiot way to think huuh? Seriously this movie sucks, with no emotion, no value. Everyone who liked this movie are complete idiots and should calm down. By the way the CGI is terrible and the acting is weird.[換行字元][換行字元]-From the biggest random, heartless, no emotion, idiot, unbelievably reckless, completely unattractive, purely uninspiring, poor, ugly, rude, very unpleasant, inhuman, horrible persons in the world."
741,This movie will take your mood swinging smoothly in every second from the very first till the last clinging sound.
742,"Endgame is just an indescribable movie. The cumulation for the 21 movies are just what marvel can only do. And that's the main thing about Marvel, everyone is just so emotionally connected and it's so greatly done!!! a must watch!"
743,"This is getting a 10/10 mostly because how it doesnt flop on its head ending a 22 movie long plot. Is this the best marvel movie? No not even close, is this as good as infinity war? No, me 2 months ago would say it is but me now would say other wise. But simply for the experience of seeing the first iron man in theaters when I was 8 to now me as 19 and making me cry it is easily a 10/10 due to it being like no other experience. If it wasnt an ending to a 22 movie long era than mayhe my score would reflect like an 8 or a 7, but due to it being what it is I am willing to bump it up. It is still better than like 15 marvel movies, it's still up there for one of their stronger movies. It's not as good as infinity war and winter soldier is still my favorite marvel movie not counting spiderman movies.[換行字元][換行字元]TLDR: Its simply unlike any experience in film yet, having a movie end a 22 movie long story and not flop on its face, usually movies cant finish a 3 movie long story without flopping, yet this movie managed to do it with a 22 movie long story. It isnt the best marvel movie, far from it, I would argue that infinity war is a much better movie, but I would say that this is my 2nd favorite avengers movie"
744,"I really liked all of previous Marvel films, but this one was a huuuge disappointment. More than half of the film was really boring, in fact nothing happened. Fight scenes looked like made by 10-year-old Marvel fan. All of the film seemed to be made out of fan theories and dad jokes. I'm sad because it's the end of this Marvel era and this wasn't the final I was expecting."
745,"The movie moves with the power of the actors who act wholeheartedly, russo's and their teams also done a very good job making this a movie to remember, a movie to tell about, a legacy that proves that a franchise could carry that much of continuity and finish it with a spectacular fireworks the whole world could see and feels."
746,Good movie but a bit long especially during the 2nd phase (could skip 30min ez) and the end is not as epic as Infinity was last year...harcore fans will absolutly love it for sure for other it's just a good ending.
747,Probably best mcu movie because in this movie everything as it should be
748,"Of course, Comedy with Fantasy and Action. The heroes are like your uncles and aunts, fun to watch but not what pumps your senses for the thrill. You'll feel all the time like it's meh, because they want to make all audiences enjoy the movie. Doing that the movie becomes average. So the characters are all good hearted and full of feelings, nothing like a hero who has True Will. I'm glad that at least this last movie didn't come with ideological references, it was just this polictical correctness that numbs us as society. Everyone is a good boy there. Anyway, the public that Marvel seeks now is not me. No problem, since I noticed it, I'll just ignore future movies from them. Leave a thumbs up if now you also agree it's a comedy movie not an action thriller movie, so other people can see this too."
749,"Firstly I am not a full on Marvel fan but I do like the Avengers, Iron Man and Thor movies so I go into each movie as a stand alone one.[換行字元][換行字元]This film isn't full on action like infinity war but despite being 3 hours long it doesn't seem like it, in fact I wanted it to continue.[換行字元][換行字元]It did feel like a star wars movie to me in some parts but that's not a bad thing, the story stuck together from start to finish when considering most movies today can barely stick together for a 2 hour film.[換行字元][換行字元]Without giving to much away it finished like the Christopher nolan batman series where it all made sense, GREAT FILM, EPIC AND IT PASSED THE 6 YEAR OLD CHILD TEST IN A CINEMA FOR 3HOURS!![換行字元][換行字元]A Must See"
750,"It's hard to criticize Endgame, given its enormous success. It certainly had its moments, the scene with Hawkeye and Nat was incredible, and the closing scene was really cool, it really made the viewer feel like he was part of the Marvel pantheon. But I wouldn't be in any hurry to see it again, and I watched Endgame 4 or 5 times. I've heard the latest Spider-Man gets the Marvel universe revved up again, so that will be fun."
751,"I was somewhat iffy going into this film. seeing Shazam! As well I wasn't too pleased with the way some live action superhero films have been lately. Venom was garbage, aquaman was barely passable (it's a soft spot for me and I enjoyed it nonetheless) then captain marvel which was a disappointment by marvel standards which was also barely passable. But then Shazam! Comes out of nowhere and becomes one of my favorite superhero movies of all time. Definitely gave us the refresh of superhero movies we didn't even know we needed lol. Why all these other movies are being talked about and not endgame? Because the anticipation for this movie was at an all time high, the recent movies (mainly superhero movies) before it were practically to help the audience clench it's thirst for this masterpiece. And boy was it worth it. Thus Endgame... the movie is a very thought provoking film that takes its jab at a very hard plot that most films don't crack quite well since ""back to the future"" this film manages to make so much story and characters and plot develop and marinate in such a well crafted movie that I can't even describe upon words. The 3 hour run time flys by so smoothly that it felt like a less than 1 hour and 30 minute film. The movie does everything it's supposed to do, then more. It's honestly one of the most extraordinary film I've ever seen. You feel the drama and the tension and the darkness, the jokes land and always stick the landing, just as much as the drama and the action and honestly every single thing in this film. Infinity war was the beginning of something even more envelope pushing and extraordinarily distinct from the last film. This is marvels best film ever hands down. (Black Panther right behind it) good job marvel."
752,Best comic book movie ever .......................................... .
753,"After seeing endgame, I felt I had to let this out It probably the best movie to date (and I'm not hyping)...it got it all -action, suspense, comedy, emotional...just about everything a movie can possibly have...keep in mind it's a superhero movie but it exceed its limit...it also the best MCU movie in my book and it far exceed Infinity War. Maybe the most exciting and beautiful part of the movie came up about the last 40-30 minutes and it's the best thing I've ever see in Cinematic history.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, it a 10 out of 10 movie for me I don't really have to recommend you go see it before you do...just avoid spoilers before seeing it."
754,"Avoiding to see any theories is very hard these days, so almost every possible scenario was in my head when i was watching this but still how they will pull this off i am glad i didn't know. I was a bit disappointed only on the fact that they way of ""fixing"" things was something ""easy"" to think but i am happy because it was Hard to actually do it! I almost cried 2 times in the middle, and of course the end.... i cried like a baby 2-3 long times....movie was short for me... felt like 1.5hours. not 3.[換行字元][換行字元]Without talking any spoilers they did an amazing job on ""visiting"" the previous movies, and there was no stupid humor but there was some coll scenes where the directors was like ""hey funs id you had this theory or question , here is why it didn't work or here is now and how it should work"" and i was glad about this. HISHE will have a hard time to joke about this one now, must most important the Honest Trailer will also have little plot halls to explore.[換行字元][換行字元]They did good job with Captain Marvel and how they used her when it was important, and i just didn't like the 1 obviously feminist scene that was there because of the ""trending"" of our times ...[換行字元][換行字元]i will re-watch it 2-3 times waiting to see it in 2D and enjoy it, and then download the brluerays. As about the end credits scenes......well...just LISTEN!"

WTF?!?!?![換行字元][換行字元]Boring as crap.[換行字元][換行字元]If they made 2 x 3 hour movies, it would still be boring as crap.[換行字元][換行字元]But, at least they humanised Thors depression....... although F-wit audiences think it's a joke.[換行字元][換行字元]morons watching moron movies. Thank Christ to no more Robert Downey Trumpstick."
756,Tbh its one of the most overrated movies because of these fanboys. You shouldnt even waste your time at the cinemas.
757,"This movie is an emotional rollercoaster. At one moment you laugh and seconds later you almost cry, sometimes tears of joy and sometimes tears of loss. There is absolutely nothing to complain about: from VFX to acting (especially RDJ) , everything is made/done perfectly. Even the length of 3 hours feels like 1.5 hours. The only minor issue I have with Endgame doesn't make it worse at all (I won't mention it as it would spoil parts of the movie.).[換行字元][換行字元]This movie is a worthy ""end"" of the past 11 years of the MCU (+the best one by now) and is an absolute must-see that you have to experience yourself."
758,"Great movie! The ending is Sad, did not expect it to end this way."
759,"10/10 Epic the best movie ever But Marvel, please i hate you 3000 😢😢"
760,Avengers endgame had very little story progress through the 3 hr run it had and it created so many plot-holes along the way.[換行字元][換行字元]Time travel is a very tricky story element to implement into your franchise it can make or break the franchise. They even touch base on some of the flaws within the movie yet still happen to create said flaws making the end product into a paradox of itself. I can delve deeper into that but I would risk spoiling the movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Aside from the paradox they created they didn't utilize Captain Marvel like they should have. In fact she was used more like a one trick pony recreating her final moments in her own movie and recycling it over to the finale of this movie. She was more of a cameo if anything.[換行字元][換行字元]They had some great moments but those were few and far between. In fact within those 3 hours I can only remember maybe 3 to 4 minutes of quality scenes (not including any trailer footage) which makes these 3 hours drag.[換行字元][換行字元]So for the final Avengers movie with some of these characters it was a bit disappointing. Definitely not the best marvel superhero movie ever nor an epic conclusion like some claim. Honestly the Captain Marvel movie was more enjoyable and that's not really that great. 6.5/10 for me
761,Amazing...simply amazing. This movie brings everything good about Marvel to the table and then cranks it up to 100. I've never had such a fabulous time in a theater before now. Marvel has created a masterpiece.
762,"Josh Brolin's voice was totally wrong for Thanos. The lips didn't even match the words. I'm also just tired of seeing the SAME old mad man trying to destroy the world and getting defeated by super heroes. Too many characters.[換行字元][換行字元]At least with the Dark Knight and some of the X-Men films they mixed it up and felt fresh. More superheroes doesn't mean better. Plus the acting was atrocious. The wooden repartee didn't help, done only to make sure everyone gets their lines in.[換行字元][換行字元]Try a new storyline and/or approach. SKIP IT!"
763,"Never ever miss this in theatres.Its not something we expected,it's too much above.Oxford should add a new word to describe such emotions.Never miss.Thank you marvel for making my day best of my life."
764,"AWESOME,[換行字元][換行字元]The script was perfect. The 2 part of the movie was awesome"
765,"It is full of Hype and exciting ,a great ending, you won't regret watching it at all!"
766,"This was a love letter to the fans, the negative comments are mostly from those who either wanted Endgame to flop -which it did not- or those who decided to watch it without any context just because everyone was talking about it. For those people: this film is not meant for you. Stop hating on things just because most people love them."
767,"This one is good but some characters are getting way too little attention. Like the other movies this one is a ""cinema movie""."
768,Seriously not getting what people like in this movie giving 10/10. This movie is horrible and very boring. Not expecting this from Marvel. It seems Marvel tried to make a cocktail of all hit formula in one movie to satisfy all type of audience. The end result - disaster. Worst movie of marvel ever made.
769,All over experience are good but movie was too long
770,"Epic ending to a long storyline and I can't wait for more to come. This was beautifully created and continued the tone from what happened in Avengers: Infinity War and ramped up emotion to 1,000. I can honestly say that is the first movie I actually cried cause Marvel has engrained these characters into our lives. Awesome work Marvel/Disney and to all the people who worked on every film up to this point."
771,This movie does everything perfect. Fans can't ask for anything more. This is perfection.
772,"There's a lot to digest after first viewing. Is the movie perfect - from writing of story, plot and character to technical aspects in sound design and VFX? No, nothing is perfect. But this is as close to a perfect finish one could wish for. An absolute success.[換行字元][換行字元]Storytelling 11 years in the making of this magnitude is nearly unfathomable and most definitely unheard of. The ability to combine epic spectacle with deep character moments in an emotional yet unexpected story like this is almost unbelievable. Sure, we can probably all dissect the movie's story and nitpick the intricacies of the plot - but that doesn't matter when the movie pulls off its greatest trick - making us feel. There's so many moments of grandeur epicness, heartfelt goodbyes and well written character interactions that the smaller details of what could've been doesn't really matter. The movie is a cinematic achievement unlike anything come before."

778,"I beg you go watch this film, it is a must see for film fans, i don't need to tell Marvel fans to see it because most likely they have already had there tickets for weeks like I have. This film is a superb tribute and ending to a saga that has lasted over ten years. The characters were spectacular, most if not every character is seen, including minor characters. The film is shot wonderfully and the all the makers deserved a much needed pat on the back for there collaborated work. Please go see this film now before I spoil it"
779,Not sure what all the fuss is about. It's no way an all-time top ten film
780,"What can i say... because of this movie i was finally motivated to quit being lazy, create a IMDB/ Rotten Tomatoes account and participate by reviewing what i had just seen. Marvel deserves my positive rating of Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]This was also the only movie i've ever deliberately gone back to the movie theaters for to see a second time, and i enjoyed it even more the second time around. Theres just so much to process and enjoy in this film, that seeing it a second time was, for me, a necessity (even though the film is quite long).[換行字元][換行字元]It's an emotional rollercoaster and not just for die hard marvel fans. It's got a bit of everything: hilarious comedy, an amazing soundtrack, emotional highs/lows, mind blowing visuals, great action scenes and a great story. It also focuses alot the individual characters.[換行字元][換行字元]Both times i saw this movie, the theater was packed with young and old alike, men and women. Everyone was laughing together, clapping together. It's got a bit of everything for everyone![換行字元][換行字元]Can you enjoy this movie, without having seen Infinity war and the other marvel films? Sure! However, i do recommend watching a few of the other marvel movies, the jokes will just be that much funnier.[換行字元][換行字元]Awesome, awesome, awesome movie."
781,Awesome movie epic movie this is a perfect end of infinity saga.......
782,"Pro:[換行字元]Okay Action Scenes[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]Cons:[換行字元]Pointless / Ineffective 'Emotional' scenes[換行字元]Pointless / Ineffective Humour[換行字元]Gender / Racial Pandering So Eager it gets awkward[換行字元]3 hrs of the above[換行字元]$300,000,000 million dollars spent on okay action scenes,[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]A generally unengaging story."
783,Perfect and sad ending to this 11 year saga with amazing fan service and connections to previous movies. I could've asked for nothing more. Would rewatch again 3+ times.
784,"As a Fan I feel Like cheated by Marvel Studios. Avengers: Endgame is a cut paste collage of previous movies & sloppy VFX ( one can watch it under magnifying glass when its Blu Ray is released). Within 3 hours of this movie 1.5 hours was of repetitions. After all the hype, theories & speculations, All that Anthony & Joe Russo cooked was a plot that even a Kindergarten MCU fan could've scripted better and Many succeeded with their far Superior imagination & theories than MCU team. Time Travel is a pathetic excuse to deal with Thanos after all the wonderful Avengers Series MCU has executed on Cinematic world Arena. It felt like they knew Endgame would be the Big Hit so they served the old potpourri with not more than 10 minutes of WOW action moments. Stan Lee's demise affected the outcome of this Movie that could have been the Milestone for Cinema Entertainment for Years to come. Wonder if this is highest Peak of MCU's Success Story. 6 Stars for many disappointments"
785,"Crying, happy and sad. never have I sat so far out on the chair. Incredibly nice ending to an incredible universe."
786,The amazing Marvel The best marvel movie i've ever seen
787,A very well executed film that provides closure by means of storytelling on an epic scale. It is ruined only by a the unnecessary part of the ending involving going back in the past one more time to revisit some things. I'll leave it at that.
788,"There is a lot to pack into this movie, even at its 3 hour runtime there is never a dull moment. The first 20 minutes establishes the fallout from the previous film and is handled with an ease of pace and elegance of nuance which lets you know the tale ahead is in good hands.[換行字元][換行字元]Establishment phase over and the rollercoaster begins weaving the characters with their egos/fears/hopes/failures/talents into a tapestry which feels familiar and yet unknown. We explore elements of each of our heroes we have seen them display before, but in a light which is full of contrasting tones bursting with risk and daring. Never short on comedy, this usually comes after a harsher more tragic aspect of the tale keeping the audience walking the tightrope of every word or gesture on screen at any moment having a greater meaning.[換行字元][換行字元]As the ride picks up momentum and specific undertakings for our heroes begin to take form there are many gags for followers of a specific genre of story and storytelling, as well as a serious and emotional tango, which keeps us guessing at the outcome of several high risk games.[換行字元][換行字元]Composition, special effects, score and set design are all of excellent quality and variety therein. Each provide that candyfloss rush which sweetens the story and how it is acted out.[換行字元][換行字元]There is a bitter edge to this funfare though, an edge which adds poignance appropriately.[換行字元][換行字元]I'm sure any fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe will have a marvelous time watching this excellent conclusion to phase 3 of the MCU and what it holds as the franchise continues forward."
789,"Endgame is an absolute cinematic masterpiece. Everything from the story, to the acting, to the music, to the action, and EVEN to the cinematography is incredible. This movie is all killer, and as a result feels much shorter than the lengthy 3-hour runtime, which is earned with fantastic character moments and payoffs throughout the movie. The movie brings out every possible emotion a film can. Endgame is hilarious, dark, depressing, intriguing, heartbreaking and satisfying all throughout, making it the most powerful cinematic experience I have ever been privileged to watch. If I could give it an 11/10 I would. Marvel has seriously surpassed all expectations by 1000 with this one."
790,I'm speechless This is movie of the century 😍😍😍
791,Epic... simply EPIC! Hard to find a better word. Just... Epic! Bravo!
792,This was everything you could ever imagine. It was an amzing end of an era.
793,I couldn't have imagined a better conclusion to the Infinity Stones saga. This movie has everything and hits all the right emotional beats along the way. I can't wait to see it again!
794,Just see it. That is all.It Making grown men cry like little girls .
795,"Boring, predictable and corny. Thor was the only good thing. Absolute trash"
796,This is Good movie. better than Avengers:age of ulitron.
797,"The Russos Brother have done an unbelievable job.Giving such back to back stunning movies is no easy.Endgame exceeds your expectations and delivers more than you thought it would.The first 30-45 minutes is a bit slow but that is it.Rest of the movie is so good and it covers up the flaws. Performance wise,everyone did a good job.Especially Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr have stolen the show.The final battle is the one of the very best you will ever see.Josh Brolin as THANOS delivers another exceptional performance.After a year long wait,Endgame certainly proves that it is the best Marvel movie till date.And I highly doubt if they will ever make better than this one,especially after the departure of Chris,Robert and the Russo brothers."
798,"Saw those media reviews online (spoiler-free of course), and I thought I've prepared for this grand finale. However, I was never so wrong. I shed sad tears and joyful ones for this, from the beginning to the end, and I don't remember when was my last time crying so many times in the cinema. The more you like these characters, deeper impact you will experience. 11 years with Marvel is a very special and absolute joyride. I'm honored to live at the same time to participate in this journey with Marvel."
799,"If you like Iron man, Captain America or Thor do not watch this movie! Marvel has ruined everything....They will probably lose millions of fans... I will never see any of their movies anymore."
800,"It's going to be very difficult to top this, and it's also very difficult to express how amazing this film is without spoilers, so I will just keep it brief and say that you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't see this film. It is an epic event in every sense of the word, and you will never forget seeing this movie. The last hout will never leave your memory as long as you live. It is the epitome of action sacrifice and heroism and encapsulates the never ending battle of good versus evil. Go see this movie. See it twice."
801,"For the entire first hour, I was really straining to hear the dialog. I stepped out and asked the theater manager to turn it up and ... maybe they didn't. But my sister (on the other side of the planet) said it was the same thing. Did the producers intentionally make the first hour super-quiet to get us to ""lean in"" and pay closer attention maybe?[換行字元][換行字元]Audio problems or not, by the end, I was really confused with so many questions ... and didn't feel super-motivated to watch the whole thing again to figure out all the little plot holes that were left untidied. I guess I'll have to wait for the Honest Trailer version to come along and explain everything... :)"
802,If you a mcu fan than it should be your best movie or not than u r not a mcu fan
803,Epic scene of battle..amazing Thor..everything really great..amazing try
804,This movie is everything we as fans wanted and much much more. From the action scenes to the character build up everything falls into perfect place finishing off this amazing infinity saga in a way I could have never imagined. This is what I call a perfect movie.
805,Will tug on the old heart strings and will be one of the best movies you will ever see.
806,"Well! There are lots of good things about the film worth mentioning: VFX, lines, cinematography etc. Even the story itself was kind of good. However, the film was overwhelmed with PC and diversity factors and principals. And because of that the film has no soul ... seems something missing or something was no right! I am wondering if PC and Diversity ever stop ruining movies? It seems they won't stop unless they have already ruined and/or spoiled all the heroes we have had for decades."
807,"Although I'm not a big fan of the Marvel saga and keep something out of date with all the movies, I've seen most of them and I consider them excellent forms of entertainment, each with special touches that make them very favorable to taste, but above all highlights the experimental creation of his ''cinematic universe'', a union of movies with different but related arguments. Endgame is the end to that great saga that for years was being built successfully to close with a golden brooch.[換行字元][換行字元]It is a journey of action and fun, totally entertaining with excellent performances, amazing effects, an intense plot and above all a fantastic villain. Each of these factors manages to create a movie of great magnitude for entertainment, and I'm sure the most passionate fans will be satisfied with it.[換行字元][換行字元]Although I don't consider myself an expert on Marvel, I consider this to be a high caliber movie for anyone that likes movies."
808,"11 years, 22 movies, a Epic Conclusion.[換行字元][換行字元]Congratulations Marvel Studios, Russo Brothers!"
809,"This movie is 10/10. This movie has it all. You like drama; it has drama. You like epic action; it has epic action. You like to cry; there are plenty of opportunities to cry. When I was a kid, I dreamed of seeing movies like this. Now people are working together and making these movies. This is the best of all the comic book movies so far. Spectacular, funny, and moving!"
810,Initial thoughts are that I'm speechless. The Russo brothers delivered in the most beautiful amazing way. There is no word to describe this movie.
811,"What more is there to say? They've had some good Marvel movies, but this is a tier above the others."
812,"How are the surviving Avengers & Co. possibly going to save half of the Universe that died? My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in ""Infinity War"" weren't just a dream): magic or time travel. All I'll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of ""Back to the Future II"" (1989).[換行字元][換行字元]""Endgame"" (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing. It starts to get lethargic about an hour in, but perks up with the three teams trying to apprehend the Infinity Stones so they can maybe reverse what happened at the end of the previous film.[換行字元][換行字元]Everything naturally leads to a huge battle in the last hour that I found boring, not to mention that the epilogue tended to drag on with too much of it being tedious. Still, there are lots of worthy bits throughout, like the opening, the unpredictable first encounter with Thanos, Thor getting flabby, the moving match between Black Widow and Hawkeye at the cliff's edge, and much more.[換行字元][換行字元]Unfortunately, the myriad protagonists work against the film because it can't concentrate on any one or two characters for very long. Captain Marvel is short shifted and decidedly dull. Plus the movie's overlong at 3 hours, 1 minute.[換行字元][換行字元]GRADE: B-"
813,"Loved the previous one more, nonetheless this was a great movie, it was wonderful to see the future meets the past. Yay for the avengers all the way"
814,"This film is, without a doubt, not only the perfect conclusion of the current MCU Phase but also the zenith of the superhero - comic book genre.[換行字元][換行字元]Going into the movie theatre I had a lot of reservations regarding the way the aftermath of the Snap would be handled and if its result would be reversed in a way that would not render the events of Infinity War meaningless.[換行字元][換行字元]Needless to say this film managed to exceed all my expectations and perfectly show the repercussions of the Snap on the lives of our beloved characters, the gravity of losing their loved ones and how they sought to reverse what had happened.[換行字元][換行字元]The film's opening 30-45 minutes show the immediate and long term aftermath of the events of Infinity War on both the physical and mental state of each main character.[換行字元][換行字元]The middle act of the film is where I was pleasantly surprised in the way that the film manages to be both familiar and original at the same time.[換行字元][換行字元]There is a wealth of fan service without it becoming cringey or in any way lowering the stakes of the overall mission. There is also a lot of development and progression for the main characters (watch out especially for Tony's and the Cap's mission) in the way they come to terms with the lives they lead until now and what sacrifices may have to be made going forward.[換行字元][換行字元]The third act is exactly what you expect but even more. It is centered around an epic battle which is filled with sequences which will be remembered for years to come. Lets just say that it is an hour-long, action packed highlight reel filled with memorable one-liners and wow moments.[換行字元][換行字元]The end of the battle brings about a new world order for the MCU and bids a heartwarming farewell to some of our beloved characters in a way that feels natural and fulfilling."
815,This is the cherry on top for all the previous movies. A great work that leaves no loose ends
816,There are so many surprises and twists in this film. I believe it's really a perfect ending for the first decade of MCU!! Couldn't be better!!
817,Absolutely strange how they could cut so strong first part of Avengers and spoil the second one! All dialogues are weak and absurd same as a few plot lines. The last 5 minutes of the film is all-around failure!
818,"This movie was a good one, but isn't not good enough, Infity War was much better. But I can't deny this movie have the best ever ""Fan service"" escenes in a super hero movie, literally I scream in the theater. But you can't let it go for that reason, the script has many holes and mistakes."
819,great performances[換行字元]incredible visuals[換行字元]story ends in a way to set worth a new generation of marvel stories/characters[換行字元]perfect send off for the original actors[換行字元]a must see for any marvel or superhero fan
820,"You probably heard people reviewing comic book movies with the line 'this scene is ripped straight out of the comic book page' and with endgame it couldn't be more true. i mean the story is touching, the battle is EPIC, and the jokes are funny. and i promise you there are SO MANY SURPRISES in this movie and they're all GREAT! i have some crazy hope and really high expectation and marvel exceeded all of them. you wont feel that its 3 hour long movie because its just so good! thank god i already had another ticket on sunday. the only critics i'd give is that i came 5 minute late :("
821,"If you ignored the PC-stuff in the last movie, it was still a pretty enjoyable movie. But this? Nothing was coherent, it was too long, and it it wasn't until the very end that it delieved any decent action."
822,"Okay..so spoilers be darned..THis movie was kinda very slow. Still a great movie. But can we talk about the ""Captain Marvel"" SCAM. They tricked us into thinking that Marvel played a big part in this movie. When she only has about 12 seconds of air time...12 seconds...ok that is an exaggeration...it was probably 10 seconds."
823,"Endgame is an outstanding movie experience. It shows a lot of respect for the MCU, it ends the arcs of the original Avengers in a fantastic way and makes a beautiful tribute to all the previous movies."
824,I felt the power of the six infinity stones. #stoned
825,Words can't even describe how good this movie is I love it I could watch it thousands time and probably will
826,"Avengers Endgame is definitely not Infinity War part 2 because it's so different. And it's even better. Great storytelling, strong emotional moments, dark and gritty tone, epic superheroes moments and battle, perfectly balanced humor. It has everything you want in a comicbook movie and so much more. It's the perfect finale for the 11 years of Infinity Saga. Marvel fans will be even more sastified to see what their beloved characters do in this. Not to mention easter eggs, references and callbacks everywhere through the movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Such beautiful!"
827,"This movie was painful. If you love the Avengers, you'll enjoy this movie. It's definitely not the best in the Avenger series.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is mostly soap opera, part heist, part pulp culture, overlaid with an ego competition.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie fails to have likeable or credible personalities. Its as if each huge ego is trying to outdo the next. The only character who doesn't play the role to ego extreme is Thor.[換行字元][換行字元]Best characters are probably Iron Man, Black Widow, Captain America, and Hulk. Worst performance (by far) goes to Captain Marvel with an ego off the charts from any previous superhero- a ground breaking performance.[換行字元][換行字元]Infinity War was the first solid Avengers movie. Endgame was a big step down. I couldn't wait for it to finish. I found myself watching the clock far too frequently.[換行字元][換行字元]TL;DR - Very politically correct, too many massive egos, unlikeable characters, slow pacing. Thought I was watching Days of our Lives."
828,"I think how viewers receive this movie is dependent upon when you were born. I was 12 years old and glued to our big screen color TV on 9/8/66 for the premier of Star Trek. I still have my Leonard Nimoy autographed fan club membership cards from 1966-69. I was in the audience in 1977 opening weekend of Star Wars after a 3+ hour wait in line. What the Marvel team created here was nothing short of spectacular. To bring these characters to life, weave their stories together bringing some to a close and launching others while still managing to cross the T and for the I, well that's epic. I've experienced a few."
829,"I have seen every Avengers movie to date. I must say, out of the four, this one has to be the best. It has a captivating plot, with a captivating storyline. It managed to keep me entertained and on the edge of my seat."
830,"Well overrated. I expected better, the previous one was better."
831,"Picks up 22 days after the climax of Infinity War with Iron Man and Nebula stranded in space and the others baffled as to what to do next. Antman re-emerges and they consider a new possible way forward.[換行字元][換行字元]Fabulous conclusion, full of wit, sadness and wonder. Everyone is great, the effects are to die for and a very well produced line is drawn under phase 3 - let's hope phase 4 is half as good."
832,"I must say, that the movie left me completely speechless. It's a true masterpiece. You also get a lot of questions from past movies answered. Most certainly I am gonna watch it again. Everything is perfect, all the scenes for a hardcore Marvel fan as myself."
833,"Literally didn't know what to say when I left the cinema...... What is there to say? 3hours of my life I'd like back again.......... Over and over again........ Watching the film over and over again........ The main battle scene had me struggling to catch everything! It was incredible! Anyone can find something to be critical about in any movie........ but if your are looking for something to be critical about your aren't doing what you should be...... watching the damn movie and loving the spectacle of it all! If the film had been an hour longer I would not be complaining! I'm not going to give any spoilers because I want everyone to enjoy it as much as I did. I'm going to see it again and I'll be getting it on dvd and watching it again, and again, and again........ Happy, sad, happy, amazed shocked, surprised, happy, emotional....... Just a roller-coaster I wanted to get straight back on! They have tied up the character arcs that they needed to so well and treated the characters, and the fans, with total respect!"
834,I don't like character thor and hulk and more Drama
835,"The most Epic way to end a 10 year marathon of 22 films. Our Marvel Universe Childhood is coming to an End game. Great plot. Epic scenes the mother of the fights and totally no one is missing from this mastepiece. Russo brothers end an era with the best way the could. I really didnt notice how the 3 hours were gone. I strongly recomment to everyone to see this movie not just one time. Tony Stark definatly must take this Oscar of best actor. What ever it takes,Avengers are here for us."
836,Overall great movie just some boring dialogue in between
837,It was not the best but it was like ok the first half kind of got boring then after the interval it gets more interesting and epic
838,"For the past 11 years MCU has been increasing their fan base across the globe with larger than life characters. Avengers : End Game: With the expectations sky high, the Russo brothers delivered a fitting finale to this franchise. What worked: 1. The emotions were very well connected with the audience. 2. Jaw dropping CGI and VFX. 3. The last battle.[換行字元][換行字元]What could have been better: 1. Screenplay a bit slow. 2. The war sequence could have been a bit lengthier.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, this experience is for a life time and hence everyone should enjoy this wonder movie in IMAX"
839,"So I could go back and stop myself from seeing this film! ""Infinity War"" was a masterpiece compared to this. Marvel please undo the 181 minutes of my life![換行字元][換行字元]Earlier we could count at least on some action scenes in Marvel movies. Not today Thanos! There is barely any action in the movie and the CGI they used in fights was extremely low quality and painful to watch. Even some basic fights and tricks were not choreographed by actors but made of a cheap looking, crappy CGI. This is unacceptable for such a budget.[換行字元][換行字元]The story is so bad even a 5-yo child could write better. Some people are sobbing for AGES (I do understand a pain of loss but come on aren't you called superheroes for a reason?) Other people just appear out of nowhere doing their things with no explanation whatsoever. How in the world did this garbage get 9\10 rating is a mystery. I guess it's a real Endgame..."
840,"Avengers: Endgame is not a perfect movie, but it feels like one. Every character get an end to their arcs, and the film itself is a great conclusion to 11 years of movies, all of which have led up to this. I wont spoil the actual plot for those who haven't seen it (the trailers have been incredible at not revealing anaything), but I will say that it is full of surprises, shocks, laughs and tears. The fact that the film manages to be THIS good more than makes up for its few flaws. The final battle is probably the most fan-pleasing, epic and emotionaly packed action sequence in any superhero movie; it was the culmiation if 11 years of characters we've come to love and care about. This is what superhero movies are all about."
841,The way Anthony Russo and Joseph Russo with the help of Kevin Feige made this perfect culmination of all the movies was AMAZING. Congratulations on creating this ending masterpiece. Astonished. Just WOW.
842,"The movie was entertaining, but so many missing details In the story. I did not like the ending as well"
843,"After the disaster that was Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame was a pleasant surprise. It's recommended for fans of comic book films."
844,"They got so many things right... then turned around and got so many things wrong.[換行字元][換行字元]If I had to guess there were many disagreements about how to go about this movie and it shows both in the writing, but also the pacing.[換行字元][換行字元]Im sure this movie will go down in the record books both in money made and ratings, but there are so many movies in the MCU that are better written and better executed.[換行字元][換行字元]Ill watch it again once it comes out on dvd and see if a second viewing changes my opinion."
845,"Omg it was awesome... I went yesterday at 10:30 at night to see it.. I have to say after 21. Films I can't believe this is the final movie.... I was happy felt like crying towards the end, existed so many emotions within a period of 3 hours... I have to say I even stroked with a couple of people next to me talking about it... I loved it the end scene at the end was the best... in my opinion between Chris Evans (Captain America) and Chris Hemsworth (Thor). I loved it I still can't believe it has come to and end... I keep thinking maybe the actors Chris Evans would change his mind and come back to the awesome Marvel movies... I also loved Brie Larson I just wish she would have had more screen time... I thought she worked well with an ensembled cast... I love Mark Ruffalo (hulk) And Scott Lang (Antman) great comedy Relief.... If you are a marvel fan like me I urge you to see it I don't know like 10 times I loved it.... I might go again and watch it...👍"
846,"It is a good movie, don't go with super high expectations, the movie delivers for sure but however, it is upsetting. I loved it honestly. It is very emotional one, I felt for everyone in this movie. Expect some confusions in this movie."
847,"This movie was actually good and enjoyable, i could say this movie has plot holes as and the middle part of the movie was pretty boring, mostly because the middle part didn't feel like avengers, but i gotta say that the beginning and and the ending was the best parts, i could watch this movie as many times i want, but to compare this to infinity war, infinity war wins in my opinion, because this one starts slow, i do recommend this but it had some flaws"
848,"Final fight scene is the one of the best action scenes ever.Movie is funny, emotionally driven film ❤"
849,Amazing movie amazing story thank you all of you all i sadness it finish too early
850,"Out of the entire MCU, the original Avengers and now Avengers Endgame are the only movies I'd happily pay to go see twice in theaters. A satisfying and epic finale - it met the exceedingly high expectations set before it."
851,Well done Marvel! No word can describe. MAGNIFICENT!
852,"Second review, Short: its epic go see it.[換行字元][換行字元]Then have you guys read the low scores? Those ppl have no brain and drag the score down cause of it."
853,"There are 2 types if movies, one is Infinity War & Endgame, the other type is all other movies..."
854,"So, the movie occurs very very fast it has a lot of information, drama and comedy but all with the perfect balance The only thing i dislike was the epic chance in some avengers, although it doesn't change the fact the movie is epic. Ironman is the star, of course, he was the beggining he is the end. The movie has weirdly cuts and changes from humor to comedy or drama, but it works. The problem is that whether you relly like it or you hate it."
855,A beautiful masterpiece that will leave you breathless and still unable to find the words to describe it 3 days later.
856,I really liked Infinity war and really wanted to see the next movie. To my surprise it was pathetic. Thanks God I wathed it on Blu Ray and many scenes I simply skipped.
857,"Fantastic 3001 times, salute!!, thank you thank you thank you verrryyy muchh"
858,What happened? The first one was so great and this turned into another marvel schlock film[換行字元][換行字元]Pacing was off. Timetravel leaves huge plot holes. Editing mistakes. CGI weak on some parts. No new music score.[換行字元][換行字元]Its like someone did a parody of infinity war
859,"For the closeup of the avengers movie, you can't find a better way. Get stick to your chair for for ride of your life."
860,It had a few actually funny scenes a few great action scenes and incredible ending. Making this movie 3 hours did nothing but draw it out to be tedious and boring. It had the potential to be the 9.1 rating people are giving it if editing had trimmed a lot more of the fat. Way over rated.
861,Tiene momentos para saltar de la butaca. Pelicula para ver 2 y 3 veces sin problema.
862,For me this was the perfect ending to a long journey in the MCU. I have ready a few reviews and I get some of the reactions. But the emotional roller coaster was just what I needed. It was hard to say good bye to certain characters but Plenty of doors were left open as we move into phase 4. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did. I won't post much more than this so I don't ruin the movie for anyone.
863,"Don't understand why people would come on here to moan and complain if they if they did not enjoy this amazing movie, if I didn't like a movie I would not come here to moan about it , I only write my views on something I enjoyed which is endgame an amazing spectacle of a movie , negative reviews reflect on the people giving them which nobody reads or cares about, a positive point what a brilliant movie gives everything and completes everything"
864,"I am please that the Russo brothers with the film. With all the films they did in the past, (Winter Solider, civil War, Infinity War and now, Endgame) it is a big conclusion of this film. and I am pleased with the acting, action, cg, etc. everything all, I have to say now is that since it's all over. I am done with Endgame it's all over. I had a ball seeing this film. Infinity War is still my favorite Marvel film. But Endgame was a good film. Sure it had somethings that made me bored but overall enjoyable. 9/10"
865,"It's been a long old journey since Robert Downey Jr started to build the MCU in a desert cave with nothing more than a trademark smirk and a high-powered quip. Back then the Iron Man suit was bodged together from scrap and imagination, a clunky knight's armour that clanked with destructive heavy metal weight rather than the fizz and pop weapon of mass entertainment it later became. Endgame is a fitting tribute to the journey this unlikeliest of superheroes (genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist) has brought us all on.[換行字元][換行字元]All the things you might have speculated about to make this grandest of finales work probably doesn't happen, of course, but enough of the chit chat was on the mark to let the fanboys pat themselves on the back. After Infinity War everyone left alive is dealing with things in their own way and the world has moved on as best it can with the leftovers scattered and scarred; given how the universe ended up with 50% of living things disappeared from existence this was always going to be a film about how to fix things so that the MCU could move on with its film and TV and merch slate intact - you don't kill the franchise that lays the universe's first billion-dollar weekend.[換行字元][換行字元]The mission, should our superheroes accept it, means some assembling and avengering has to be done again so they can do the improbable against the impossible to take on the inevitable. How it's done doesn't matter as much as the nostalgia ride it takes us on. It's an accomplished bit of story-telling that manages to bring 11 years of franchise work together in a way that propels the action forward without getting too bogged down with unnecessary filler - everyone has their part to play, and true to their characters there are plenty of thrills and more than enough laughs to keep things light.[換行字元][換行字元]However, there are so many nods to so many characters that it does descend into a spot the cameo competition at times. While it can be fun to play along it's also the point at which things flounder slightly, feeling more like a necessary roll call to check who's attending the Endgame CGI bish bash boshery. That said, and with only one or two minor exceptions, there is a very satisfying sense of completion to this heroic journey.[換行字元][換行字元]In the beginning there was one man in a cave with an iron will to survive, now there's a universe where everyone's lives have been touched, character arcs have been fulfilled, technology in the stories exists at the point of being magical, and everything is possible. So, what next?"
866,"It's just the best movie ever. It's full of emotional scenes, heroic scenes. It's a movie to remember"
867,"I was a little late watching this one and had heard a lot of mixed reviews leading up to doing so; however, I personally thought this was the best possible conclusion to the current Avengers storyline. Or... the conclusion for now at least.[換行字元][換行字元]First of all, I really enjoyed getting to see a more human side of all the Avengers in this one. I thought the film makers did an amazing job at really giving us the time to connect with each and every super hero in this franchise if we hadn't thus far. Doing so really helped set the stage for the ""Endgame"", if you will. I really enjoyed the main characters throughout this film as well. I thought Thanos had wiped out the majority of my favorites with his infinity stone snap, but I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed the remaining characters and how well they worked together throughout the film.[換行字元][換行字元]Also, I just can't say enough about how beautiful the Marvel films are and how well the CGI, costumes, and FX are done. For a film series that relies so heavily on FX and CGI, they manage to pull it off so smoothly and seamlessly.[換行字元][換行字元]It's hard to go too far with a review without giving away any of the storyline; however, I feel that any true fan has already seen the film at this point. For those who haven't I can only say to come out from under the rock you're living under and check out this amazing piece of cinema history.[換行字元][換行字元]I give Avengers: Endgame a 9 out of 10!!![換行字元][換行字元]PS - Captain Marvel is soooooo badass!!!!"
868,"Starting off with 23 days after Thanos's 'big snap', the entire world is devastated and broken. The Avengers are trying to bring everyone back, but will they succeed? Endgame ties up the loose ends perfectly, into a nice little bow. Not meant to be seen just once, this movie is funny, dramatic, nerve wracking and absolutely PERFECT. After it is over, Endgame will leave a void, like you've lost a dear friend. This roller coaster 3 hour astounding action packed cgi AWESOMENESS is bound to leave you misty-eyed. Avengers Endgame is not just a movie, it's an experience. We love you 3000."
869,"You would not watch it again, Over hyped money collection movie. It is very similar to Star Wars now"
870,"There is not enough words to describe this piece of art, literally the best thing I've ever seen, it has it all, all the emotions all any one could ever want in a movie is there. You're missing a lifetime experience if you haven't seen it yet."
871,"For me this is the best movie in the MCU universe today, greatest closures, epic fights, a lot cross feelings"
872,Marvel really stepped up its game in this movie and it was a great wrap up to phase 3 of the MCU. I love the effects and the whole movie in general 10/10
873,"What's up with the time travel? ""The OA"" also dig into this kind of multiverse travel, but clearly they did it better and try their best not to put tons of plot holes into their film, but clearly the director of Endgame decided to ignore it. Seems like their fan base forgot their brain when they watch this too based on the ridiculously high rating of this movie."
874,I like movies. I like big Georgia blockbusters. But as a human with an opinion and an account I feel I must help other humans in the right direction. And that direction is: Watch this movie in fast forward until you see something interesting. This way you'll be able to enjoy it and not waste 3 full hours. As for the bots who gave this a 10...I hope your internet is forever slow.
875,"Avengers: Endgame. Overall it was... ok. The intro got off to a quicker start than I imagined, and the expected final battle was certainly fun followed by a touching denouement. Those elements (barely) justify the film, in my opinion.[換行字元][換行字元]However, the intervening 2 hours is a tedious collection of scenes, lame jokes and awful characterizations wrapped around an extremely tired and poorly thought out plot device. Should you see it? Sure. How can you not after investing so many years in the arc? But most people I saw it with were ultimately (at least somewhat) disappointed.[換行字元][換行字元]Worst performance in the movie is easily Mark Ruffalo who has now solidified his legacy as the absolute worst Hulk and Banner ever committed to film. Thor was also terrible, but that's been a rapid devolution since Ragnarok.[換行字元][換行字元]Surprisingly, the movie was pretty much stolen by the stellar performance of Jeremy Renner, which should build interest in the upcoming Hawkeye series (even if it is just a vehicle to hand off the mantle). Scarlett Johansson also stepped up her game and was very impressive."
876,"Exciting, fun, solid and beautiful, worthy of Oscar"
877,"A movie that is going to be with me for a lifetime..!! Blown away, amazing>>!!"
878,"The movie is good but it does not surprise at all but to see what expected possibility is chosen. Capitan Marvel and due to the overdose of characters, the other too, lack of the opportunity of developing well in the movie. Maybe the script should be more developed in two movies. Anyway, good for a lot of people."
879,Of course we can't make a full comic universe in one movie but pretty impress did like it almost cried 3 times ! Lots of Comedy thanks to Thor. Some sad part .. a lot of applause cheering!!
880,"I have been a lifelong Marvel fan and ever since the first IronMan which came out in the year 2008, leading up to this movie. After 22 films spanning across 11 franchises in total, this is an absolutely epic conclusion to the finest narrated saga of modern history. The story telling is absolutely phenomenal and every single emotion, thought and effort that has been put in the this film has been nothing short of groundbreaking and astonishing. Hats of Marvel, there is and will only be one name. That name is ""THE AVENGERS"". #Whateverittakes, #Partofthejourneyistheend."
881,Amazing movie i have ever scene. marvel make good job. love marvel & love avengers💝
882,"No Spoilers, no clues to the plot! Promised! But if you are a human being with (some) ""feelings"" you could need some tissues! Because when you realize that it's over, then you may shed some tears of joy and sorrow."
883,I have watched this movie three times already and I'm still GUSHING about it! To put it simply: I loved this movie 3000!!
884,"I don't want to give away anything about the movie, if you are a true lover of movies, just watch it. You will really feel how cinema has progressed through hundred years. 'MARVEL'OUS"
885,"Endgame was the most hyped film of the season for three reasons. One is the shocking anti climax of infinity war which ends with a cliffhanger. Second it was rumored to be the last film of most of our favorite characters due to various reasons so fans were mentally preparing themselves to see them for the last time and say them goodbye. And last is that the makers remained tightlipped regarding the film which increased the curiosity level of the audience. With all the hype, does endgame meet your expectations? Let's find out.[換行字元][換行字元]Positives: The film is divided into three acts. Though the first act is slow its very intense and emotional. The second act was the most entertaining where time travelling is done as it has many funny moments. And the third act was action packed which provide you goosebumps and in end makes you emotional.[換行字元][換行字元]Now let's talk about our favorite characters.[換行字元][換行字元]1. Iron man: With 3 standalone movies, main lead in all avengers films, second lead in civil war, a cameo in incredible hulk and an extended cameo in homecoming, RDJ kept on earning the love of audience making him the God of MCU. In endgame, he once again win your hearts. Your heartbreaks when you see him skinny and weak in the beginning. He had some heartwarming moments with his daughter and also when he hugs his father while time travelling. And in the end when he snaps saying his epic line ""I am iron man"" and dies he nails a heroic image among audience. Don't know how MCU will be without him. We love you 3000. 2. Captain America: My favorite character in MCU. In 8 years cap's character was constant being a serious, mature and no nonsense Steve Rogers. In first avenger and the avengers everyone felt him as a boring character. But in winter soldier, he proved that he can be badass like James bond and Ethan hunt. In age of ultron he got a bit sidelined whereas though civil war was his film audience saw it as an avengers film. Plus, he earned the wrath of iron man fans for hiding Tony's parents murder and they mocked him saying that if bucky wasn't there then iron man would have killed him in the end. Later in infinity war he got less significance though he was given a great intro. In endgame, he plays a very crucial role who keeps on motivating his friends. And I thank Russo brothers for giving him the most epic scene where he lift Thor's mjolinir. That scene showed what cap is worthy of. And he gets a happy ending where he time travels and goes back to Peggy. Thank you Chris Evans for making Captain America my favorite character. 3. Black widow: though we miss her badass action in endgame she wins our hearts for sacrificing herself for the soul stone. Especially the fight between her and Clint to die for soul stone is tension packed.[換行字元][換行字元]Negatives: I can't believe how Russo brothers ruined the character of Thor whose fan following grew leaps and bounds with ragnarok and infinity war making him the second favorite avenger. I understand that he was depressed for not going for the head and it was fine showing him as a fat drunkard but in the end at least he could have given him some elevation. I liked professor hulk but we missed his smash. Also we wanted a rematch of him and thanos. Time travel concept is confusing and compared to infinity war, thanos character was less explored here.[換行字元][換行字元]Verdict: On the whole, endgame is a highly entertaining and engaging film despite being for 3 hours. But compared to infinity war it was not that satisfying. It will be a treat for iron man and cap fans. Thank you avengers for entertaining us for 7 years."
886,Perfect way to wrap up the marvel series of films allowing new heroes to fill the void that cap and stark left behind
887,"Barring a few shoddy fillers here and there, Marvel's Infinity War saga has been an otherwise enjoyable experience otherwise. However, Avengers: Endgame fails to live up to the expectations set up by its predecessors. The concept of time travel, while quite alluring is ridiculously tough to get right and the Endgame is brave but poor attempt.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is riddled with plot holes and at many places the scenes just feel redundant. You could very well skip a decent part of the movie and trust me, it would hardly make a difference in the end. Major characters like Captain Marvel, Thor and Dr. Strange were underutilized and definitely warranted more screen time.[換行字元][換行字元]There are a few positives that would still keep you going. The fight scenes are great as usual. Characters like the Iron Man and the Hulk manage to salvage a decent part of the film. The ending is quite predictable so despite the great action scenes, it fails to leave any significant mark."
888,"A ten in the book. The previous movie kinda was a bit of downer towards the end because multiple movies were announced a little too early. This movie has many surprises and completed many story lines and also planted the seeds for future story lines/heroes. 3 hours of movie that is paced perfectly is what you will see when you watch this. Putting yourself in the movie mentally is probably the best way to approach this. Imagine the Thanos snap, imagine the Avengers being in shambles, imagine Tony Stark and Steve Rogers approaching you to join them in one last fight. It was an amazing movie, with an unforgettable end.[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]Final thoughts: The next movies has a lot of potential to lay down w.e it wants. We are in it for another 10 years Marvel! Bravo![換行字元][換行字元]Kinda Spoilers but not really: Thor and Banner get the short end of character development but if you think about it ""That is as human as one can be."" Its natural for them to act and become what they are in this movie."
889,A masterpiece of cinematography and script writing.
890,"If you thought Avengers: Infinity War (2018) was as best as it could get then you're sadly mistaken. Endgame doesn't disappoint, with amazing references, those one liners and a pinch of comedy; this film is definitely setting high standards. The perfect balance between drama and action. A must watch!"
891,A movie to appease the masses the hulk is weaker than a nursing home patient and Thor throws out more one liners than Bill Burr forget about this please please love me movie and go outside and ride your bike or pull some weeds out.
892,"When I set foot in the theatres to see endgame, I knew this movie will blow me away and boy was I right. The way the Russo Brothers made Endgame was unbelievably well done to where I couldn't explain in words. I walked out of the theatre in complete silence. The only words I can say are two simple words. RIP DC"
893,"Best Marvel movie I've ever watched. Probably even the best show I've ever watched obviously contending with The Game Of Thrones who's new season is beast. Marvel did an amazing job can't wait for Spiderman and all the other new releases to see how they might top this. RDJ, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Holland (playes a great Spiderman btw) and just about all the actor's performances were spot on even if some just had short scenes. I hope Scarlett Johansson gets her own movie though there's still a lot of mystery surrounding The Black Widow."
894,"Every single marvel movie serves as a stepping stone to this very movie. This movie is complete on every aspect from the beginning to the end. Every Avenger plays a significant role that tells their story to the full. Filled with action, emotion, comedy and a great storyline, this movie will blow everyone away in 2019 and beyond.[換行字元][換行字元]Thanks to Marvel and the Russo Brothers for making a movie that will make history in my personal books."
895,"This is a special movie. Movies like this come out rarely and they aren't always good. The one before this was Logan, and even thought Endgame is on a much larger scale, the feelings, I left the theater with, were very similar.[換行字元][換行字元]This is one of the boldest MCU movies, in terms of creative choices, and one of the darker ones, in terms of stakes. I really felt our heroes were in genuine danger throughout the movie. Endgame retains that lighthearted charm, that we've come to love in Marvel movies, but also takes itself very seriously.[換行字元][換行字元]When I look back on previous MCU movies, i realize that this is one of their most beautiful movies, in terms of cinematography. The only letdown for me was the score, as in some vital spots it was barely noticeable and/or repetitive.[換行字元][換行字元]The cast was solid throughout. The Original Six and in particular MCU Trinity take the center stage here and all do their finest acting....[換行字元][換行字元]And just like Thor for the first time in a Long time, I genuinely don't know what's to come and that's very, very exciting..."
896,"This may be a very long movie but every minute is worth it. Containing a cast of a generation, this movie is the perfect way to end to the avenger films. The action, drama, story line, flow, emotion, and music is stellar to a point where you can't even comprehend how amazing this film his. The comedy may not be the funniest all times, it makes up for it for having such a mesmerizing third act. I honestly thought I was gonna pass out for how massive the third act is. This is without a doubt one of the best Marvel to date. A movie that I will show my kids and my kids' kids and so on. I promise you this movie for ALWAYS AND FOREVER hold up to it's hype."
897,Save your money and time. This movie could've been done in a hour and half. Big disappointment compared to the other avengers movies.
898,It was amazing saw it once and will be seeing it again and again. Brilliant.
899,3 hours about nothing. Only one reason why this movie has too large box office is hyping.
900,"This movie took me on an emotional rollercoaster I've never experienced before - one moment it had me laughing, then I was in tears a few minutes later, and then it took a turn and got me reminiscing about movies that are now 2-10 years old. I'm speechless. Thank you for this experience!"
901,"On an introductory note, I've noticed a few scattered, rather negative (1-5 stars) reviews here, and most of them seem to be complaining about pace, lack of action, plot-holes, ""Hulk did this"", ""Thor did that"", etc. and certainly everyone is entitled to their opinion. However, a good majority of these reviews sound like they're coming from people who had jumped way too hard on the hype train, had ridiculously high expectations, or have invested a majority of their life in the MCU. Additionally, if (hypothetically) the pace and action of ""Endgame"" had followed the same style as ""Infinity War"" these same bedroom-dwelling critics would likely complain ""OMG! The pace and action was too similar to Infinity War! I'm so disappointed... blah blah blah"". And if ""Endgame"" somehow outpaced its predecessor with more action and fight scenes, most movie goers would likely be nauseated with an abundance of CG and a more confusing story-line.[換行字元][換行字元]Now, on to my review (sort of) short, sweet, and spoiler free. I've seen nearly all of the Marvel movies except 2 or 3 of them, and I've never witnessed anything like ""Endgame"" and I don't think I ever will again, in this lifetime anyway. While Endgame wasn't as fun and action-packed as a few other movies (including Infinity War), it was an emotional, complete masterpiece of movie-making. I felt like I was watching several Marvel movies all wrapped up into one nicely designed package. Even though it all happened in a span of about 3 hours and the pace was rather slow in the first half, it never felt like the film was dragging and I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Although Endgame was somewhat flawed and had some disappointing and confusing moments (a tiny, small spoiler: the time travel' stuff), character issues and lost opportunities for a more redeeming scene/moment, I never felt these very minor issues detracted any of the movie's story and overall feel and atmosphere throughout. Not afraid to admit this but for one of the rarest moments in my life, I cried during a few various scenes for very obvious reasons. In my opinion, ""The Avengers: Endgame"" is not only one of the top Marvel movies ever made, but will stand the test of time as one of the greatest movies made during the 21st century. Having said all of that, I'll probably visit the theater one or two more times, as should everyone :)"
902,When something is everything you ever hoped it would be...and more. Nuff said.
903,Please don't waste your time on this...Its very boring. It's like they pre-sell the movie with a good ending of infinity war. Its a rip off. Trust me you won't believe this. I quite after 30 minutes.[換行字元][換行字元]I am writing this review to alert people: keep your money and time for something else.
904,"I just got into MCU last month and spent almost a week to watch all the previous movies. I have to say that Endgame is really amazing. I mean, EVERYTHING is on point."
905,"This is a great film, although it's slow start, it does make up for it towards the rest of the film. Truly recommended for those marvel fanatics."
906,"My son and I Loved infinity war 10 stars, great plot and character interaction, this one felt lacking in both. I'm glad others like it though, my kid who is 7 fell asleep 💤 at 1 hour, he asked me 40 mins in if it gets more interesting . When he awoke an hour later my answer was yes, but not much. Loved Captain America and the hammer, movie tingles in that scene. He might rate it lower?"
907,"The perfect blend of action, comedy and emotion and it all works really well"
908,Robert Downey Jr.....Chris Evans...Paul Rudd and the Chris....great writing. Nostalgic and whimsy. Intense and loving....the Wit and banter make it all worthy. Oscars should be given out...and kudos the writers the artists and all the actors. For a 40 something lady....loved it and most importantly watching it with my son. 5 stars!!!
909,Best Marvel cinematic universe film ever till date A true culmination of 22 marvel movies And shows us what it costs be a hero Excellent storytelling insane action heart touching emotions Ultimate movie 👌🏻
910,"I'm going to make a leap here, just to leep things simple. The cumulative effect of so called ""super heroes"" is to the true film fan what the white man was to Native Americans: End of life as they knew it. There are 25 actors in this, and it's really sad to see them become prostitutes, like their studios. Why do you think great actors and directors wouldn't be caught dead in these cartoon films? Because they are the antithesis to great film making. Its really sad. I understand my 13 year old daughter seeing something like this. I don't understand older, more mature people acting like these are real films becauseT they arent. They are like the cartoons you woukd watch, before the main attraction started. They all have been dumbed down for the masses to the same exact plot: Good versus Evil; always. I wouldn't, no couldn't; sit through 15 minute of this pablum, not even if you paid me a year's salary to watch. It""s woeful trash, and is ruining the film industry. Stanley Kubrick the master of all the great directors, is rolling over in his grave. You won't see the top directors making any of this trash. People like Abel Ferrara, Marty Scorcese, Ridley Scott, William Friedkin, Spike Lee, or Denis Villeneuve go near a movie such as this. Its all publicity! All you hear about is how much money is made in the opening weeks, but nothing about what the films are like. It makes me sick. I would rather have my teeth drilled without novacaine than watch this. The same goes for the best actors. No way you will see ever see people like Bobby DeNiro, Christopher Walken, Matt Damon, Colin Farrell, Ethan Hawke, Nicole Kidman, or Al Pacino in any of these movies. I understand completely. It's simple. They have integrity! Skip this woeful hyped up trash and go see a real film; not a cartoon."
911,"Being a huge marvel fan I already had high expectations for this movie....the surpassed all and blew my mind!! The most entertaining and action filled Avengers movie of all time. The comedy, action and sadness all perfectly executed! Sad that this is the last Avengers but it's the most perfectly written finale to an epic saga!"
912,"Full of surprises I really enjoyed it Perfect ending[換行字元][換行字元]Goodbye ""avengers"" and thank you"
913,The perfect ending to a huge franchise! Definitely the best movie in the MCU... Couldn't be more satisfied.
914,"I love this movie not just because there are fan service moments, but the writing is woven together from previous Marvel films and this phase of the MCU culminates in grand style. The fan moments are justified then, because of the writing and the story offers balance. There is no shortage of humor, as you would expect; It has become a stapel to have in a Marvel movie. I can connect with the characters (protaganists) who after losing to Thanos in Infinty War must accept that defeat and move on with that sour taste still in their mouths. This is something most of us have more than likely had to deal with at one point or another in their lives: Defeat and how to pick ourselves up after losing. People can say what they want about the different issues and ""plotholes"" but honestly, ""Avengers Endgame"" closes out this phase in the MCU in such an epic way.. It'll be interesting to see how they should attempt to top this!"
915,Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow[換行字元][換行字元]Amazing movie! Was completely shocked all throughout the whole time!
916,"I just see this last movie of Avengers , i believe is the best one , but sadly cuz is the last one ..."
917,"Its finally here. The moment we've all been waiting for. Avengers Endgame is now in cinemas and you should go watch it right now. I don't know how many times I plan on watching it but it is worth every penny no matter how many times you plan on watching it because it's that good. Forget good, it's great. Forget great, its spectacular.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers Endgame takes place immediately after last year's heart-stopping Infinity War cliffhanger where our surviving heroes are in grief of what happened and the rest for you to watch. This is by far the best Marvel movie ever made. Endgame is the conclusion of a journey we've all been going throughout 22 movies. It is a worthy end to the original six Avengers arcs, leaving space for our new superheroes to take their place and lead a whole new generation of Marvel-lous storytelling. But let's not talk about the future, we are focusing on Endgame here.[換行字元][換行字元]Unlike Infinity War, the stakes are higher, the drama is wells up in you constantly and the sheer epicness of what makes this Avengers installment so perfect is that from beginning to end, you will laugh, cry or have goosebumps all over your body. The highlight of the movie was, of course, our beloved six original Avengers, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye. Making them the main focus once again after so long was a step at the right direction and it would totally make sense since we all know that Endgame will be their last movie together. The best among them all was Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans. Finally seeing them together after havoc that was Civil War and working together, trusting each other again was an absolute treat for all us fans.[換行字元][換行字元]I can't tell you anything about the storyline for that I would be spoiling you but I can tell you the 3 hour runtime was worth it. Come to think of it, it didn't feel like I was watching it for 3 hours for that I wasn't bored or looking at the time. No scene felt pointless or draggy. The entire 3 hours keeps you attentive, at the edge of your seat and makes sure your eyes do not get to miss a single second. The pace seemed familiar to all famous fantasy epics such as Lord of The Rings and Game of Thrones. Like LOTR and GOT, they focused more on character development and getting the audience to experience what the characters going through as well. With that, there are the epic battle scenes and the epic score to go with it. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely outdid themselves making their most complicated and best Marvel script ever. Alan Silvestri returned to write the score once again and outdid himself by including themes from all the previous movies including his previous scores from Captain America The First Avenger and the main Avengers theme by making it them sound more brassier and bigger, fitting the to the scope and tone of Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]So, Endgame. Go watch it. Marvel fan or not, do not miss the epic finale to the Infinity Saga of the MCU. If you do end up missing it, you should live under rock or kill yourself with a rock. With that I'm rating Avengers Endgame 12/10 because it exceeded all my expectations of a great Marvel movie. I thought Infinity War was spectacular but Endgame, there is still no words I can find to explain what the movie or how it made me feel, not only as a Marvel but as a moviegoer which makes Endgame even more of a superhero spectacle than Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]P.S. unfortunately, there is no post credit scenes or end credit scenes"
918,The movie is fine but is very overrated. The first 2 hours are so slow and boring to be honest. This movie only amazed marvel fan's. The 8 out of 10 is more than deserved.
919,"Being a marvel fan, I've had the best experience of my life watching this movie, what a movie❤❤"
920,"Hard to wtite a good review without spoiling anything![換行字元][換行字元]This is by far thr best Marvel movie to have been created in the past 10 years! I laughed, i was amazed, i was confused at times and then I nearly cried! I haven't cried at a film since I was a child, but this was the closest I've come!! I can think of no better way that Marvel could have rounded off the series, this film is nothing short of an emotional masterpiece![換行字元][換行字元]Well done to everybody involved in making this film the triumph it is!"
921,"Today I saw ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019), directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and many, many more. Oh man, what a cast! Just like ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018), I was blown away by this film. The Russo brothers have done it again! Great story, great acting, great special effects, great sets/locations, and great soundtrack. Every factor is top-notch in this movie! I am not going to spoil this movie. This is all I'm going to say about it. Is this the best superhero movie? No, there are some I personally like better. But, it's in my top 10 best Marvel movies for sure, if not top 5! Overall, the cast is extraordinary, and every character had their own shining moment. I was kind of skeptical about Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. Most of you know that I absolutely hate the Ant-Man comic book character. Nothing against Paul Rudd, but the movie version of Ant-Man is very obnoxious. I was worried he was going to ruin it with one-liners and jokes. But, to my surprise, he was not that bad. He played a critical factor in this movie, and his jokes were few and far between, and actually funny! The other characters are stellar as usual. Under the direction of the Russo Brothers, that's not surprising! That's all I'm going to say, I will not spoil the Endgame. You'll have to go see the movie to find out how good it is for yourself! Believe me, you won't be the same. If you think you know what this movie will be like from watching the trailers, you have no idea what you're in for! Props to you, Anthony and Joe Russo. You guys did a Marvel-ous job again! I look forward to other future movies with your involvement, and I hope you continue to direct other superhero movies in the future! This movie is absolutely worth the money to see it in the theater and also to buy on DVD. Obviously, I give this film a full 5 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Avengers: Endgame"" yet, what are you waiting for? Go check it out if you haven't already! Remember, once you guys see it, DON'T SPOIL THE ENDGAME![換行字元][換行字元]""We're in the Endgame now....."""
922,This movie was perfect. I'm literally in shock and awe as to how this movie wrapped up 22 movies so perfectly and how all-encompassing it was. The greatest cinematic event of my time. All that's left to say is thank you for the ride MCU.
923,"I'm not going to spoil anything. Overall, the movie was enjoyable, but those 2 first hours... So many plot holes. If you're someone with a minimum of logic and appreciate intelligent writing, chances are you'll get mad a couple times in the first 2 acts. However, that last hour was THE best segment I have ever scene in a superhero movie. It was really epic and everything you probably hoped for. It really saved the movie and boosted my rating. The rest of the movie would've been a 6-7 in my opinion. It's definitely not the best MCU movie like some hardcore fans are pretending it to be, but you still have to see the movie. The conclusion is very satisfying! You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cheer. I even had goosebumbs at one point, and I'm not even a HUGE fan of the MCU. It's a must see. Enjoy!"
924,"An ending so worthy, it could pick up Thor's hammers... thrice! The MCU could easily stop here, and it would be fine by me. Everything in this franchise is rounded out perfectly, but of course they will keep going till they kill it. But for now, ""Endgame"" is the ending we needed. Now let's see what the future brings..."
925,This movie was awesome. I liked it a lot. Of course the actors were awesome as well. The story was great. 3 hours sitting straight... well it wasn't seem that much for me. The Russo brothers did this very good. Respect for them. This whole cinematic universe is incredibly good. At some points you will get emotional :) And this movie is just a perfect ending. That's it.
926,"I've seen a lot of movies, but this one took the cake. and im glad that i took part of it. not only it the best super hero, mcu, movie, its also the best movie of all time. it had everything that i wanted in a movie. this movie spoiled me, i dont care what other movie that is coming out now. probably except for spider man homecoming and star wars, other than that, i dont care. now i want to see it again, this time in imax!! best movie experience i've ever had."
927,"After the masterpiece that was infinity war, I did not think they could top it, I was very wrong. This film does everything right, from the action to the comedy, the emotion and above all, to the fan service. This is everything I could have hoped for from the movie and I will definitely be re-watching it. A true masterpiece"
928,The film was a fantastic. Didn't feel like 3 hours. Goose bumps all the way through. Sad that this story is over but can't wait for the next instalment. Bring on phase 4!!!
929,"Avengers: Endgame is hands down one of the best or probably the best movie of the year. Even though it's basically a part two of Avengers: Infinity War, it seems like a completely different movie right from the start. The movie has some amazing performances from the likes of Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans and many more. I hope to see Endgame winning awards at next years Oscars. This film was the best possible way to wrap up such an amazing franchise. Thank you Marvel."
930,This movie hits all the right moves and I couldn't have been happier with how they concluded this Marvel chapter.
931,"It's probably the most emotional and amazing superhero movie ever made. I mean it's the closest to perfection a superhero movie can be and i am proud to have seen the MCU grow from iron man to avengers endgame. Amd tony stark, we all love you 3000!"
932,"Endgame was written to be the epic conclusion of 20-plus marvel movies. It is a good conclusion but not an 'epic' one. Every character is given a good arch and heartfelt moments. The movie just lacks the magic of Infinity War. There are very few fight scenes until the big fight at the end, and I just found myself getting impatient, waiting for something to happen. The plot was jumping around a lot and sometimes things just seemed to happen so quickly, which is weird when many scenes seemed to drag on. Nebula contributed heavily to the plot, but I don't think it made enough sense, and it also makes Nebula the most annoying character, as she already gave away the soul stones location in Infinity War. Everything about Hulk felt off, and Captain Marvel just didn't fit in. To be fair, there are some amazing moments in the final act, and I finally got the action I was craving. But by then, I had somewhat disconnected for the movie. What I loved about Infinity War is it starts with amazing momentum and never stops. Endgame took just a little too long to establish itself. Even once the Avengers start executing their plan, there is very little action or epic moments. I also think Thanos was underplayed in the movie, as were the use of the infinity stones or any superhero powers. The heroes definitely could've played around more with their settings as well. Maybe it will be better when watched in conjunction with Infinity War, and maybe I'm a little too much of a Thanos fan. All in all, it's a good watch but the movie failed to make me feel the emotions I felt from Infinity War."
933,This movie is so boring.Too many unnecessary details.You have to sit in movie for 3 hours so i dont think its worth it.I waa dissapointed and really sad after watching it.Dont waste your money and this movie doesnt deserve anithing accept 1.
934,"The movie picks up faster than Infinity War, and the third act is one of the best moments in cinematic history!"
935,"Ths movie is just EPIC 🔥🔥 Yes thts d word i find now aftr watchng End game.. Lots of emotional moments,, epic conclusion, many funny moments spcly including Thor & Hulk.. 3Hrs f pure Drama, emotion, Action... Gr8 bckgrmd scr.. & last bt nt d least hell f a Climax sequence..

Finally end of an Era, 11yrs f journey Ends today with teary eyes , laughs, & gr8 memories.. Thnk u MARVEL ❤❤🙏🙏"
936,"Don't get me wrong I really do enjoy Marvel movies but i'm not a die-hard fan where I have seen every movie tons of times, read all the comics, andknow all the characters. With that said, that will definitely be a big factor on how much you will enjoy this. The more you know about Marvel, its characters, and the universe, the more you will enjoy it. Even for casual fans like myself it's still a really enjoyable experience with some enjoyable action, some pretty good comedic moments, and some heartfelt moments. In the beginning I was still trying to figure out who's who. It was difficult to discern who was who at the beginning (it didn't help either that there were very few name drops) but as it went on I started to get it more (and some characters like Iron Man and Thanos were easily recognizable.) And no, i'm not going to spoil anything in this review (most of the Internet has already done that anyways). But even with a bit of confusion it was far from enough to keep this from being an enjoyable watch. Plus it's not the movie's fault as that's how most of these movies are, depending on strong continuity and targeting the fan base more than anyone else. However it was pretty cool that they included scenes from some of their previous movies like the original Avengers, Thor: The Dark World, and Captain America The Winter Soldier, but have it fit in with the time-travel aspect of this movie.Even for a casual fan like myself I was able to pinpoint which movies they were (thanks to the movie indicating what years each were taking place). It also didn't feel too out-of-place (albeit feeling a little weird to see the scenes pop up here.) It would have been nice if the movie started out with a little recap of what happened before and included scenes from previous movies to tie the story together, but it was still cool that they added those scenes in. I was skeptical of the three-hour running time but the movie managed to make it feel like it went by relatively quickly. It was also awesome that so many characters from all the different movies were in here. However it was a bit disappointing that I felt like some didn't get enough screen time like Spider-Man and Doctor Strange. Even Thanos didn't have as much screen time as I expected. But their appearances were still enjoyable and the final battle was AWESOME with all the characters coming together to help the Avengers out. It's easily the highlight of the movie (as it should be).[換行字元][換行字元]Remember that this review was from a perspective of someone who hasn't watched a lot of these movies (and some were so long ago that it almost feels like I haven't watched them at all.) While I may not have loved this movie 3000, I definitely loved it somewhere around 2500."
937,"Not saying what happened but 3 hours are way too long. There could be easily 30 minutes cut due to long scenes and plot discovery.[換行字元][換行字元]Lots of people had to""hit the head"" because of the long scenes.[換行字元][換行字元]Just saying"

939,"I thought Infinity War was great, how can it get better? With Endgame! Three hours of perfection and emotion of the best ever kind, I can only give it a 10/10 not 20/10 that is well deserved. Global domination at the box office with records turning to ash! Can not tell you how good this movie is as it is off the scale! Marvellously wonderful!!'"
940,This has got to be the greatest film I've ever seen
941,"Story and the plot are the foundation of any movie and this film isn'tr very well in that matter. of course much superhero movies are like that however.[換行字元][換行字元]It is obvious that we can expect things that are not rational compare to real world in sci-fi or fantasy movies so we measure them in compare to their own introduced logic. we accept some basic unnatural things and then we follow the new rules. Based on the rules the marvel universe has introduced us previously, End Game has too many holes. characters suddenly get very stronger than what they were seconds before or in compare to their history with no reason. Time traveling bugs like in all other time traveling movies present here as well. this happens also to emotional relationships between them. movie has too many cliche scenes with boring dialogs.[換行字元][換行字元]when we compare this one to Infinity war, it is a huge disappointment. However, it is still worth watching and if you are a fan of Sci-fi, it entertains you. It is just an average superhero movie."
942,The worst avengers with weird plotchanges that took no risks. With a predictable story and predictable ending. Boring at times.
943,Best Superheros movie ever with unexpected e end and best way to end MCU
944,"It is so difficult to express what a person that just saw the film feels. Completion, astonishment, wonder, surprise, happiness, sadness are just a few words that come to my mind at the moment that help me describe what I saw. This film has it everything! Plot twists, an amazing storyline, tributes to the past movies, humor, tears and everything you wanted this long-waited Marvel film to have. 3 is just the real number in hours for how long the film is, but in reality when it starts until it finishes, you forget that number completely by how immersive and well made this film is! This is the best film Marvel has made so far and is one unbelievable way to conclude 21 movies and 10 years worth of MCU history. Joe and Anthony Russo, Thank you!"
945,"Picking up after the massive losses of the Infinity war, the scattered Avengers are grieving their losses and figuring out how to go forward. How do you cap off the first wildly successful Avengers franchise? This film is made for the fans. Five of our team went. Some of us are diehard fans and some have only seen an occasional movie. We all felt like it was a truly well done movie that was worth our time and emotional energy. Parents should know that if your child could sit through Infinity War without squirming or being afraid- you should be set for this one! But it is a little over three hours in a theater! It was an amazing decade of movies from Marvel and we've had some great conversations over them. For our full reviews and discussion questions after the movie- check out down the hobbit hole blog dot com."
946,"The film claimed to be super duper buster blockbuster hit after the movie Infinity War, and kept that promise also. Some Critics and Peoples said that the Movie is Overrated, but I can say clearly that they will definitely be DCEU fans who are saying like that for Endgame. They are just trying to undercast the grossing collection of worldwide. Anyway, The movie is for those people who saw MCU last 22 films and awaited for the conclusion as the twist was Thanos in their every movie. Feeling Sad for RDJ... 😭😭😭"
947,"Saga of infinity was built 11 long years. 22 films. Everything was going to this event and it was cool. The film causes a huge number of emotions, but discarding them, we see a lot of plot flaws that leave behind too many questions. Is it good movie? Of course. Is it perfect? No. Is it worth seeing? Absolutely Yes."
948,Utter crap - left the theater upset and exhausted. I hate everything about Brie Larson - she's ruining Marvel for me. Best character development for Thanos completely destroyed. Don't even get me started on Thor. Give 2 and not 1 for Cap and Stark.
949,"Limitless Pleasure and joy, can not be defined in words, it can only...well i don't have the words yet."
950,"Wow! At the end of this movie I just didn't know how to process what I had just seen - it was that good. For the last five years Winter Soldier had been my favourite MCU movie - today that changed. It is a rare occasion that I give a movie a 10/10 but this movie just blew me away and I felt many emotions throughout it. If you're a fan of the MCU go see it ASAP before it gets spoiled for you. For those trolls giving it a 1/10 - come on, you're either a DC troll (you can like both Marvel and DC) or someone with no soul."
951,"Had to make an account to write this, but yes this is worth a 10. Mainly on the hype train to keep this brilliant film as highly rated as possible."
952,"Endgame ends the entire MCU, 22 movies and nearly spanning 11 years. The directors had a very clear vision in their mind on how to conclude this avengers and bring on the next set of Avengers. Its one of the best and unexpected way. The movie answers all our questions which snapped in Infinity War. More than you expected. Bt one thing, every MCU fan will come out of the cinema with satisfaction and disappointment (cuz Infinity Saga ends). Kudos to all the cast and crew, their hardwork really paid off. The endgame is one thrilling ride of disappointment which in the end , even if you're disappointed you'll be happy. Enjoy it by yourself rather than hearing from others."
953,"The action is massive, the cast huge, the scope in size is bigger than ever, but most importantly the emotions are deep and rich. Because of where Infinity war left, we get to see our characters in this world in a very different place and that provides all of our actors to emote in new and deep ways. Beyond that the Russos take certain characters in some bold and new directions and they're still taking risks this late into the game. Where Infinity war spread the spotlight throughout almost the entire MCU, Endgame trims down the cast to primarily just the original Avengers plus some additions, so everyone gets a full charater arc htroughout the entire film. Throughout the story they are able to squeeze in a bunch of plotlines that we've seen throughout the franchise thus far, and it all leads up to the slam-bang finale that somehow manages to top both the airport sequence as well as the battle of Wakanda. And as you move into the last 15 minutes of the film they manage to successfully close out this era of the MCU. In closing you feel satisfied and you think to yourself: This is a pretty MARVELous conclusion."
954,"Starts with iron man ends with iron man and cap. I gotta say its the most masterfully crafted story of all the marvel movie i saw. Its bitter sweet that we wont see them in another marvel franchise movie again. But just like tony stark said ""part of the journey is the end"""
955,We laughed we cried we cheered we were on the edge of our seats Love it Did not disappoint
956,"I'm among those people, who normally don't engage in writing reviews. But this time I really have and want to. I rewatched the infinity-saga prior to Engame's release and there couldn't have been a better ending to it then the one it got. It really has been an epic ride and I feel privileged to have been able to be a part of it. Though only being a spectator, I feel connected to these characters, they are like long know friends. Endgame is the epic and monumental end to the saga which began over a decade ago. And oh it is more then worthy to be the last milestone on this incredible journey. I went through so many emotions watching this, joy, pride, happiness, sorrow and a sense of being alive and what it means to be human. Just watch it, you'll see what I mean, I really don't promise too much. It's truely hard to say goodbye to so many beloved characters, but they get the ending they deserve and will always be the franchise's core. Thank you for this amazing journey Marvel."
957,"I'm assuming the low ratings are by comic book nerds. This movie was amazing. A laughed out loud, by myself, many times and cried a lot. I'm really surprised by how much considering this is just a block buster super hero movie. The thing is, I actually like movies. And I know they are entertainment. Are there holes in the time travel plot? Sure, but who cares. Just use your imagination to fill in the holes. Or don't think about it too much. It's not real life folks. I'm just grateful I live in the exact period of time where movies like this are possible. It's amazing what they can do. Imagine someone from the 1920's or 1820's saw this? Be grateful. This movie was a masterpiece. If you want less plot holes, watch a film, or read a book. This is a movie. And a damn good one."
958,The most beautiful film I have ever seen in my life.
959,"'Avengers: Endgame' (or ""Avengers 4"") is the culmination of 21 films of inter-connected storytelling and while it's not the best film ever made (although it may end up the highest-grossing), it is certainly a fitting conclusion to one of cinemas most ambitious undertakings. If you haven't seen enough Marvel films to understand what's going on (what have you been doing!?), you'll still probably enjoy this, but a lot of backstory and character knowledge is assumed. This film follows on directly from 'Avengers: Infinity War', but it definitely helps if you've seen 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' and 'Captain Marvel' since then.[換行字元][換行字元]OK, some things that will help outline the film, but I don't think are spoiler: Scott/Ant-Man (Rudd) and Clint/Hawkeye (Renner) get plenty of screen time, seeing as they weren't in 'Infinity War'. Natasha/Black Widow (Johansson) and Bruce/Hulk (Ruffalo) also have a bit more to do, which is fitting, giving all the original Avengers time to shine. Thor (Hemsworth) still gets plenty of great jokes. But, as always, this is the Steve & Tony show, with Steve/Captain America (Evans) and Tony/Iron Man (Downey Jr.), reconnecting and leading the Avengers as they try to undo what Thanos (Brolin) did to the universe in 'Infinity War'.[換行字元][換行字元]Plot-wise, I don't think it's a spoiler to say there's some time travel involved. It's not totally out of the realms of what we've seen happen in other films, so you can go along with it. This obviously leads to some funny throw-backs/sentimental moments with other characters. Some of the start/middle is a bit of a slog, but it's all set-up for the end, and they can't be too happy & having fun after what happened. The final act is very satisfying, but also quite emotional and sad in parts. It's handled quite well. FYI: No credit scenes at all, so feel free to go to the bathroom after the 3 hours are up!"
960,The best movie ever. You can't expect what will happen.
961,"This film was perfect, what an amazingly emotional way to sign off phase 3 and I am sure stan Lee would of been extremely happy with.[換行字元][換行字元]As I grown man I don't cry at much but this film made me cry on numerous times. Both happy and sad tears fell down my face. Truly a master class movie!!"
962,"This is the movie us fans have been waiting too watch for a very long time, with much anticipation this film delivers on almost all of our dreams and much more, with unexpected turns and call backs that make being part of the 11 year journey so much more rewarding. This movie is what fans have wanted but I must warn of you haven't seen any of the movies before this, then it's probably not a good Idea to watch."
963,"The best Avengers by far. Unique, entertaining, emotional and just so well done. Very impressive."
964,A complete let down as they tried to turn End Game into some family comedy bit. They should have stopped at Infinity War.
965,"This is the greatest finale to a series ever. Pretty much every storyline comes together in a satisfactory matter and the last 60 minutes of the movie is amongst the best finales in the history of film. I expect RDJ to get an Oscar Nom for his performance, but everyone in the movie did an exceptional job in their roles. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and cheer; you will experience every emotion you can imagine. I recommend seeing the movie 10/10 and I don't see how any superhero film will ever top this one."
966,"Well, I am impressed and honoured to be part of this family. This people getting together to watch and live the epic climax of such a vast and heroic universe. Beacause this film is all about this. About a huge family getting together to fight and save the world. It is not a movie. It is not just a movie. It is in a way a phenomenon, which moves every fan and fills their hearts-our hearts- with enthuisasm, joy and a sense of pride to be a member of this extermely big event.[換行字元][換行字元]The film as a film is also one of great value. The conversations between the characters are funny and well-written, the big stars get a nice amount of character developement, most of the plot points feel natural and logical to happen and the final battle is jaw-dropping.

967,This movie is outstanding and superb. Must watch. Hats off to Stanlee.... Thank you Stanlee... We are very great ful to you.
968,"With 21 movies leading up to this huge ending, they actually pulled it off better than I thought they would. I had high expectations for this movie, but it was waaaay better than i thought it would be."
969,"Growing up on the MCU films has given me a connection to these characters that makes this movie amazing. My only problem with the movie was the step backwards they took with Thor from Ragnarok and Infinity War. But not A big enough issue to lower this from a 10. Well worth the 3 hours, doesn't feel long at all. In fact the pacing was pretty quick."
970,"Marvel shake the ass of Captain Marvel low, and hit back wildly strong 💪, good god what a Movie, i hope every single person will see the movie... Emotional closure for some, Joyful come back for others, i guarantee you all if seen all MCU movies you will be totally mind blown Enjoy planet earth Thanks MCU very much for it"
971,"Absolutly terrible film. Endgame does not have any of the power, fights, or any part of any Marvel movie. This feels like a horrible one-off DC movie. The story could have been good but WORST follow through I have ever seen. They completely destroy The Avengers from what you have seen so far. The story is slow and seems like they didnt care at all how it ended. The fight scene is rushed and you get to see each person take one swing then they are out. Infinity Wars set up an amazing open end and Endgame ruins 10 years of Marvel films. I am no longer a fan of Marvel. Thanks for the decade long build up to this. And its the last Avengers film, at least with the ones that we know, so they can never fix it. So if youre looking for what you have come to expect from Marvel movie... Look somewhere else."
972,"Hurts to be a fan and say something like this. Avengers: Endgame is a movie that takes too long to mesh, forcing a situation of drama that does not convince in many parts. Practically 2/3 hours of film with many unnecessary dialogues and misdirected performances. The plot holes and bad decisions of the writers is quite evident, except for those who do not expect much from a movie that should end a fantastic universe era built over eleven years. Even so, it has it's high points in 1/3 - great moments, solid acting, and so much fan service. It's a pity that's not in the same level of Avengers: Infinity War at all, but is an 'Ok movie' and don't deserves 10/10 and 1/1 rates."
973,A must watch movie but only those who have watched previous parts will understand.
974,"11 years later , 21 films later . A pure masterpiece was born . 3hrs of heartmelting hardhitting , chest thumping film. Thank you stan , thank you Russo and thank you marvel for this beautiful film to look back on after I have kids and I show this to them and say , I lived a beautiful life."

976,One word: AMAZING! What a satisfying culmination to this amazing franchise! I've never seen anything like it on the bug screen before! Just wow! Dont believe those who give this movie below 8 rating. They probably just want to be different ;) Seriously it exceeded my expectation like a million times!
977,"I was impressed with the film, especially the performance of Tony Stark"
978,"Endgame was certainly the end of an amazing saga. Epic, touching, funny, sad. It has a little of everything. True - it's overly long, but if you are a fan of ANY of the characters, you really didn't want it to end. Beautifully done, Disney. You have my complete respect. You took something that could have been a few cheesy kid movies and made them enjoyable for most ages and ended it with great reflection. You hired great actors, writers, directors and made brilliant products - Bravo!"
979,This was the most scatter brained writing for a Marvel movie I've ever seen. Just god awful.
980,"Avengers: Endgame is the best Superhero movie I've ever watched of this era, irrelevant of DC or Marvel.

981,This movie will go down the history as the most epic cinematic masterpiece of the 21st century. The fact that MARVEL has become so successful is the way they have presented and projected mythological stories in their Universe with stunning visual effects and soul raising soundtracks.
982,Of course they have to slip in the usual modern PC bs.
983,"This is made by people who do, for people who do, and this movie itself, does, love the MCU. You can think of it as a TV show finale. After 21 episodes that are all feature length. And before you can even say ""oh no those are all terrible"", this immediately proves itself to be an exception to that rule. Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn't mean it doesn't have any. Or that they're anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren't, all get significant depth. I remain one of the few people who argue that Age of Ultron did deliver that, albeit in small concentrated format. This easily tops that. Everyone is pushed into a situation new to them. The trailers hint at some of these, whilst leaving others as incredible surprises. Make sure you avoid spoilers before watching this.[換行字元][換行字元]This picture moves fast and packs a lot into its not quite lean running time. In other words, it's directed by the Russo Brothers. The length is justified. I wouldn't cut anything from this. The emotional moments don't feel sappy. The countless callbacks and references don't feel like they're just there to make you feel good for paying attention to all that lead to this one. The acting shows just how well all of these performers understand the characters. And the screenplay does the same for the writers. The effects are astonishing, yet again getting us to care about individuals that we know are all CG. It uses the varied skills, equipment and the like, of the unique heroes and villains, creatively. This delivers deeply satisfying closure. It truly is a conclusion. It's not trying to get you back to the theatre for the next adventure. The few currently confirmed entries into this franchise don't need hyping, anyway. Spider-Man with Mysterio? Another Black Panther story? The unfairly fired James Gunn returning to round out the trilogy of the Guardians of the Galaxy? Solo Black widow, *finally*? More Dr Strange? Shang-Chi, The Eternals, Blade? Keep 'em coming.[換行字元][換行字元]I recommend this to everyone who's taken this entire journey. And if you're someone who's skipped some, or held off on this series up to this point, this is an excellent reason to address that. Unless they're simply not to your liking. This is not going to change that. It's not meant to. 10/10"
984,Fascinated to see all the super heroes..but more surprises and high moments were expected
985,"The best end for marvel studio movies, and best story and drama"
986,I think it would disrespect the movie if you write something about this movie...
987,"Once again I debated with myself, whether I should write a review here. I know most of you won't like what I want to say. I also know with over 4500 reviews already here, most of those who may agree with me, won't even get to see it. It will simply get lost in the sea of fake reviews (paid or otherwise) flooding most of internet sites dedicated to such things. But eventually I decided that keeping what I want to say, in my belly will hurt more. So - here goes:[換行字元][換行字元]It's a great film based on a few false premises, some of which I already discussed here more than once. See on my review page what I've written about Infinity War, or Captain Marvel. In my personal book, every time a comics superhero dies, somebody made a mistake he (or she), didn't know how to fix. The control directors and script writers have over this sort of material is un limited. So if people don't like the character, and I mean real people not review writers that have a personal grudge against superheroines, because the actress is Israeli or because she was made too strong. If real people don't like the character, you wrote it wrong. Let's agree, it didn't happen here. People love the MCU characters, they were all beautifully written, and each actor performing them did wonders. They became as real as fictional characters can. So I knew what happened in this movie had to happen. I even wrote so in my review for infinity war. I must admit, I didn't guess the way they'll go about it, but I knew the many franchises, stemming from the MCU couldn't end. It wasn't a secrete, they kept on working on some sequells while working on this movie. And still, they did surprise me (and everybody else too). But, this sort of a surprise, dosn't cut it for me. Let's carry on with the toy box imagery, that the Russo brothers spoke about in their own IMDb interview. Think about going to play with your friend, he/she shows you a boxful of amazing toys, ""I love them to pieces"" they say, and the very next thing they take out a hummer and break some of them to smithereens. Surprise you? didn't I"" yes, you sure did, but you're an idiot. And the fact, the entire movie prooves you're not, is making it even worse.[換行字元][換行字元]There's no reason in the world to drive the franchise this way, apart from the ego of the people having all the toys, their stupid wish to surprise us and to proove they really can do whatever they want.[換行字元][換行字元]I may have high esteem for their abilities. I have to agree, it was a great movie - I really didn't like it. And all the reasons for the ending we got, that I can think of, are making it even worse."
988,"After 11 years and 22 movies, Marvel Studios brought us the most ambitious movie, the greatest culmination, it is nostalgic, sentimental and completely unexpected. All the characters are so well-balanced, to each one is given plenty of screen time to development. If you're a marvel fan you'll feel like you're finally complete, you've never seen anything like this before, there are many references to all the 22 movies and there is a certain inevitability about the plot, there are plenty surprises. The movie present us an incredible balancing between nostalgia and novelty, you will scream, laugh and cry, it is the Marvel recipe elevated to the highest level. There's just so much in it, that I can't even write about it without spoiling everything. This is not the end for Marvel, but it certainly marks an ending for several of the characters we've watched and loved over the last decade, there will be more superhero franchises but it's hard to imagine any one being so culturally resonant. It is the grande finale."
989,Avengers endgame is the best movie ever not just superhero movie but the best movie ever this movie made me laugh this movie made me exicted and the most this movie made me cry this movie is the conclusion of 10 years of Marvel movie this was my childhood and it came to an end the most satisfying end
990,"It was amazing. The audience applauded about 3 or 4 times, and I cried at the end. I absolutely loved it, and would watch it again."
991,"Can you use the prism of film criticism on a unicorn like the conclusion of a 22 film arc, two parter superhero extravaganza?[換行字元][換行字元]Probably not.[換行字元][換行字元]But even comparing it with other Marvel films or even Infinity War, this is an indulgent party which overstays its welcome. Like a constant rush of sugar, and some of those sugar highs are gloriously fun, at the end you are ready to say ""Goodbye"" and eager for something of substance.[換行字元][換行字元]The major issue is that once time manipulation is introduced, then any existential threat is reversible.[換行字元][換行字元]The first hour is ploddingly slow, the cast are good but boy they look tired and Capt. Marvel goes close to stealing the film.[換行字元][換行字元]Despite that any film lover will have to see this...an event rather then cinema."
992,Great movie and I like it. I watched this movie 2 days ago.
993,The movie is good. I think Disney gets that fans felt that Captain Marvel is an intruder within the series. Iron Man and Captain America lead the show with class and good dialog. Nebula steals the film in my estimation. There's a little pandering towards an all female avengers film but it doesn't hurt the film in general. So why 7? I didn't like the treatment they gave to Thor. I think that was lazy writing.
994,"A brilliant end to the MCU as we know it , I'm excited to see what other things come from the MCU"
995,"Where do you begin with this film? I doubt there's that many people who turn up to the cinema (or pick out a random DVD etc) and see a film called 'Avengers: Endgame' and decide to watch it without really knowing anything about it. Basically, it's the finale to a series of 21 (I think!) films which have spanned over an eleven year period. So, do you need to watch all those films before watching 'Endgame?' No. But it sure helps![換行字元][換行字元]However, to give the most briefest of summaries, 'Avengers: Endgame' is a superhero movie where Earth's mightiest heroes come together to right the wrongs of a bad purple dude called 'Thanos' who has only gone and wiped out exactly 50% of the universe by collecting a load of magic (on 'infinity' to give them their proper name) stones and then putting him in his equally magic glove and snap his fingers to achieve this feat. Luckily, Earth still has enough heroes left to stop him.[換行字元][換行字元]If - and I find this hard to believe - you have never watched anything that has come before it, you may just about get what's going on. There are battles, shocks, surprises, plenty of action and computer-generated characters in crazy worlds and locations. So it's fun. But I think that's a severe minority who will view it like that. For the rest of us - particularly people like me who have been following the franchise from the very beginning - will see it through completely different eyes. We will get every last reference and portion of 'fan service' (and there is plenty of that).[換行字元][換行字元]I won't go into details because this could well be the biggest cinematic/filmic event to date. Franchises like 'James Bond' may have had more installments, but they were individual stories and didn't all link up and come together in one almighty conclusion. So this is the longest-running story ever on film (yes, I know you can probably watch the previous entries on their own and understand them as one-offs). In contains all the endings you'll need for your favourite characters, such as Thor, Iron Man and Captain America. All three superheroes are played - as usual - to perfection by Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans. If you've followed these characters since the beginning, you won't fail to be moved by watching their various conclusions.[換行字元][換行字元]I loved it, but it's not without it's flaws. It's worth noting that it's over three hours long and, for all its fan service, it does tend to drag in one or two areas. Plus it's quite 'exposition heavy' meaning characters have to explain the 'science' of various fantastical events for us - the audience - to properly understand the ways they're going to dig themselves out of such a hole as restoring the other half of the universe's population.[換行字元][換行字元]However, if you've watched the majority of what's come before 'Endgame' then you'll probably sit through this and enjoy it to various levels. I've seen plenty other reviews and most - if not all - have been positive about the film. I don't know where the MCU (or 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' to be correct) will go from here. I'm sure it'll be good, but - for some reason - I just can't see it ever living up to the hype and novelty of this first 'phase' of the overall story.[換行字元][換行字元]Oh, and for those who weren't too taken with Brie Larson's 'Captain Marvel' character - don't worry - she's not in it that much.[換行字元][換行字元]https://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.com/"
996,The movie picks storyline at its own convenience. Impossible things become possible at the noise orchestra. My biggest complain is that there is no coherence especially how do you quantity powers of these super heroes ? Just hit smash and do it all over again.
997,"I usually do not watch movies twice in such a short amount of time. But after I did the Double Feature (at the Midnight premiere) with Infinity War almost 2 weeks ago, I re-watched Endgame yesterday and it was as amazing as my first impression of it was! And while I will not spoil anything about Endgame, I will talk about things Infinity War! So if you have not seen that yet, do not blame me for anything revealed here.[換行字元][換行字元]My summary is a pop culture reference and there are quite a few in the Marvel movies, hinting at other franchises (Alien got name checked for example in Infinity War and even ""copied"" or ""homaged"" if you will and there are a few in Endgame too). But those little digs are not too important, they are just nice touches for those who know them. Having an understanding of the MCU as a whole, from Phase 1 to now Phase 3 is way more important. And as someone who is not too familiar with the comics myself, I can tell you that knowing the movies is enough to enjoy the franchise.[換行字元][換行字元]Still you can google the other stuff or even make your own conclusions. Now that is a lot of foreword and I haven't even gotten one word about Endgame. But as I said above, no spoilers here. What we do know (from the trailers) is the beginning. But whatever we saw and thought we knew - what happens not even half an hour into the movie, will rattle you. Now what?[換行字元][換行字元]Yes the first hour of the movie is ""slow"", but it had to be. There are ramifications after the snap and the characters we learned to love, that we have close to our heart, have been torn apart. Quite literally gone with the wind - everyone is thinking how is this going to be resolved (no pun intended)? And the movie will give you answers, and will even try to sort of explain things that are quite - unexplainable.[換行字元][換行字元]And while there is full on drama, there is still a lot of humor. The movie takes beloved characters and does things to them - or rather the weight of what happened does things to them. What exactly? Well that would be telling, but let me tell you some very bold choices have been made. And if you are not emotional at least during some scenes, you are taking away a lot of fun for yourself.[換行字元][換行字元]I can be a cynic too at times, but taking this apart (which you can do with every movie), is only hurting your own viewing pleasure. There is so much love in this, for the characters, for details, for the fans - it's just a rollercoaster and I'm not afraid to say that I shed a couple of tears. It is after all tying knots and bringing certain things to a conclusion.[換行字元][換行字元]That doesn't mean there isn't anything more coming (because we know there is, next up Spiderman as an in between movie before Infinity War?). And there are some familiar faces coming back to Endgame from other movies that we haven't seen in a while but also new cameos like Ken Jeong. I'm guessing there will be a deleted scene with him, his scene seems to short for storytelling purposes I reckon.[換行字元][換行字元]Epic fights, epic emotions and dialog that is hinting at things to come later in the movie ... which you will see even clearer with repeat viewing(s) ... The Russos did it - Kudos to them, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee (RIP) and everyone else involved in this of course[換行字元][換行字元]Edit: Endgame works even for people who have not seen a single MCU movie yet (confirmed by a friend of mine). But of course the gravitas and the conclusions of everything will work way better if you have seen the rest of the movies. Also let me add that this is ""technically sound"" as some would put it - or just plain great visually speaking. But I reckon this is a given anyway. Popcorn (or Nachos or whatever you prefer) to perfection"
998,One who miss this movie in theatre is gonna regret. Must watch. RDJ and Chris Evans at their best
999,Dfhkjfrdhhhhhgghhyhhzzhzhxhxjckcjucjdidjjcjxjjdjxjxkxkkxjxjdsnjdjdjdj
1000,Walking into the theater to see this i had my questions considering i belived you couldnt beat infinity war however they did it more action more plot more humor everything is bigger better faster but be warned the movie is extremely long i suggest you stop by the snack bar before and if your allowed to refill during the movie but aside from that i totally recomend you go see this movie just be careful with young kids
1001,"There are just far too many inconsistencies and questions with this film to mention here. Suffice it to say that there is something seriously wrong when a minor character such as Nebula gets something like 60 minutes of screen time and characters such as Scarlet Witch, Dr Strange, Spiderman, Black Panther, Winter Soldier and others appear for maybe 5 minutes..."
1002,Had my dose of Avengers Endgame today. Started off pretty good and was going along fairly well then i said to my partner what happened to Captain Marvel she is hardly mentioned in the movie so far. Moving along the movie gets very serious and lots of laughs and crying and the going back in time comes up and they work out how and why. Stilling enjoying the movies but still wondering when CM is going to make another appearance . Great scenes followed with lost friends and family and time for the big battle and boy was it was battle when all seemed to be lost guess who made an appearance ever so short and sweet. The battle ended with the good guys coming out victorious and a little twist at the end . Gave it 9 stars not 10 as they could of done better hopefully there will be more captain marvel movies as i was left thinking is that it for her one movie and small parts in the Endgame.
1003,"This is without a doubt the best,most emotional,sentimental,unexpected movie I've seen in my life It got me crying like a baby several times and smiling and emotional I mean wow what a way to finish a decade of making great movies,absolutely amazing"
1004,"They made it that way on purpose, so that most people would have to say ""yes, we think we understand, yea..."" so not to look like a bunch of idiots. There's power in the denial! But go watch it for the laughs, I'm not a type of person to cringe over a cheesy joke, but whoever was responsible for comedy relief this time around has gotten to me! Was it RDJ? He a genuinely funny guy.[換行字元][換行字元]I rate this sci-fi fantasy: 6/10 -1 for over the top CGI, -2 for deus ex machina, -1 for trying to make me feel for too many characters! Because I can't do lazy writing. and -1 for shameless AUDI plug but I won't go below 6."
1005,"The plot is tastefully designed and includes mindful participation of every Avenger unlike what few others have to say. I am certain every subplot has to have a reason which in Marvel style would be revealed at a certain time in future.But for now, go and watch this because you are going to cry,laugh, smile and feel a plethora of such emotions and be satisfied thoroughly with the outcome of the movie."
1006,"First off, I want to preface the fact that I'm not a diehard Avengers fan. I've found the previous movies to be entertaining and I've enjoyed watching them for the most part, but I have never be blown away after seeing one until now. All I can say is WOW! I never thought I would experience such a wide range of raw emotion from watching an Avengers movie. The acting was incredible, the story line was rich and the pace of the movie and how it unfolded was spot on. There was never a point where I felt the movie was dragging on or plateaued. Usually I wouldn't be able to sit through a 3 hour movie (even my 5 year old was engaged in the movie the entire time - crazy, right?!) without falling asleep but I honestly didn't want this movie to end. It had just the right amount of action and heart felt drama. It wasn't predictable in the least- characters or storyline. They incorporated all of the characters flawlessly and it was impossible for me to not fall in love with every single one of them. I experienced so much joy from the humor alone because it was genuine humor and not full of the typical cliche jokes and one liners that some of the past Avengers movies have had. On the other side of the coin, the movie is a tearjerker. I don't think there was a dry eye in the entire theatre during the sad parts-my eleven year old son and my boyfriend were even tearing up. I would definitely recommend this movie a thousand times over. You will NOT be disappointed."
1007,"I don't want to spoil here but I have to say it was the best movie of the MCU. There were laughters and tears and even ""wow"" factors in this movie. There were 5 rounds of applause that I heard from the entire audience through out the film (yeah, 5!!!!). It was an epic ending of a whole journey!!! 😭"
1008,"Salute Stan lee sir, Thank you Anthony Sir... you all gave huge imagination power.... And the movie is The best.... One and every action is Awesome...."
1009,There is no word to describe this film. Just watch and enjoy it.
1010,Not bad but it's the weakest avenger movie. It's just mediocre
1011,"I had no choice but to watch it to finish the sequence. The worst of all the Avengers movies. Apart from some action scenes all the rest it is pure lame dialogues and poor performances. Purely made to make money out of a ""trendy"" public that are rating this movie high because I've never met one single person who has read the comics and like this garbage. At least, there will be no more of this, I hope."
1012,After sleeping a night over what i just have seen endgame leaves me with a smile on my face. Sure the humor went far off in some scenes and not everyone could love dude thor but it all had its reasons. The whole plot though we knew it included timetravel completely surprised and three hours just flight by. I enjoyed the movie and also understood the sobbing of some people in the audience during specific scenes. Overall i just can't give less than 10 stars simply due to the fact that this movie wraps up 11years of pure joy in my opinion. I only disliked the fact that they had to introduce cpt marvel in her own movie just for 5min screentime. Femme fatale scene also was not necessary at all. Black Widows prequel would have been a way better choice so we could understand her action better. Cpt. Marvel would have been a solo movie option after showcasing her in endgame but thats just what came up to my mind. But i have to thank marvel for the past 11 years!
1013,"Liked Infinity War and some other Marvel movies as e.gö Thor 3 more. The story was kind of too much and too chaotic, why even hard core SciFi Fans can get disappointed by the many logical fails in this movie."
1014,"I have to say after all this years and all this big expections we had as MCU fans this final Avenger movie was exactly what we need to see a pure PERFECTION. I don't know from where to begin the movie has everything...amazing story, amazing acting, amazing plot this was by far the greatest Superhero movie and not only! I really want to thanks all the producers, the Russo brothers and of course the cast for making this film a 10/10. Im glad that im in this family!"
1015,"Don't want to give any spoilers, but let's just saw the theater was full of laughter, tension, and applause basically the whole way through. Amazing!!"
1016,The best Marvel movie ever......Comedies....Emotions....Goosebumps.....Sentiments.....Just Love it!
1017,"Worth watching, I enjoyed it from beginning to the end"
1018,It was great but I expect more for the finale. I hope re-release version make it happen
1019,Hyper ratings are not realistic it wont go over 8.5 for me
1020,"Infinity war had set up huge expectation from the Endgame. I was looking forward to the movie but I was mighty disappointed. The first couple of hours of the movie are really slow and dragging. The fight scenes are OK but seems hurried up. The story line is emotional but that is not the weak point for the movie. Some how it felt disjointed and underwhelming. I wish it was as beautifully crafted as the Infinity War. Not sure if we will get any more of Avengers in future , but hey part of the Journey is the end!. Thanks Marvel for years of entertainment :)."
1021,"What a perfect ending for avengers series, very emotional and enjoyable to watch, for the events some could be a pit better but it's very good overall."
1022,I got disappointed about Thor and Hulk. And the Directors of Marvel for making the Thor and Hulk too weak. The reason i went first day first show because to see Thor. Russo brothers is suck.
1023,It was pk but much much to long. Infinity Wars was alot better. Iron man dying was a but to dramatic. I should have waited to come out on Firestick but since I just spent $5 and change was t that great a loss just my time. You have been warned.
1024,Absolutely amazing the whole 3 hours was worth to spend and ending was exceeded my expectations. thank you so much for not spoiling the ending and thank you so much for making it the best ending ever thank you MARVEL
1025,"Honestly, just go and watch it. Never have I ever seen a better one, avoid every spoiler, you won't be dissapointed."
1026,Just some super heroes whining the whole movie. Such an example!
1027,"Everything you could want in a sci-fi epic. The action is perfect. The story is perfect. The thrils send chills down your spine. The jokes are hilarious. And the emotional beats are more than just tear jerking, they are sob jerking! Perfectly concludes the story arc of so many characters and the MCU itself. Not to mention one of the most emotionally filled endings I have ever seen! EPIC!!"
1028,"No matter how it turned out, I would have nothing but respect for what the filmmakers behind the MCU managed to pull off in just over a decade. A slate of 21 movies sharing characters, themes and story-lines - connected by a joint goal to get the audience and the characters to one harmonious conclusion. After 2018, in which we got one of the MCU's finest films in Black Panther, and surely their most ambitious (at that time) in Avengers: Infinity War, the pressure for Avengers: Endgame to deliver on a decade of build-up and potential seemed like an impossible task.[換行字元][換行字元]I can't help but think of what happened with Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. We started with a terrific punch of fresh air in Batman Begins. Then Nolan made what is considered by many to be the best superhero film ever made in The Dark Knight (it's not my personal favorite, but I do love it). TDK became one the most successful and highly-praised films of all time. Then the pressure - how could the third film in that trilogy possibly live up? The answer: it didn't. The Dark Knight Rises was a thoroughly entertaining, well-acted movie. But it was riddled with plot-holes and conveniences that contributed to a film that simply could not help but feel disappointing compared to what came before it.[換行字元][換行字元]I say all that to say this: Avengers: Endgame lives up not only to its terrific predecessors from last year, but also the entire 21-film run that came before it. It serves as both a conclusion to and celebration of all the films that led up to it. It delivers on every single expectation (at least from this fan) and then exceeds them. It is as epic a film as the industry makes in this time, and there isn't a minute of the three hour run time I would shave. So many of the little easter eggs and sly moments from the past decade of these movies are called back in brilliant and inventive ways, while at the same time delivering something completely new.[換行字元][換行字元]While I liked Infinity War, my biggest complaint was that the film's editing felt jarring. It had the task of juggling many story-lines (and I respect the monumental effort), but it seemed like it just shuffled between them too quickly - rarely giving us time to mourn for lost characters or fully soak in important events. Endgame completely fixes this issue. This is a master class in film editing and if the Oscars ignore it in that category come awards season, it will truly be a blemish on their continually tarnishing record. It does take its time, but in the best way possible. When characters face dark or emotional circumstances, we truly feel them. These are characters we, the audience, have bonded with for over a decade. And all of that emotional connection pays off perfectly.[換行字元][換行字元]Another great highlight is that many characters who fans feel have been kinda left out the last few films get big and important story-lines in this film, finally moving from supporting players to huge plot-shifters. It's great to see so many great characters finally living up to their full potential.[換行字元][換行字元]Everything else works. There's a reasonable amount of humor to balance out the heavy drama. Every actor delivers some of their finest (if not their best) work in this series. The special effects are phenomenal. Character design, production design, and cinematography continue to hold up the high standards set by other great films in this franchise.[換行字元][換行字元]I really don't know how Kevin Feige, the Russo brothers, and their talented team of filmmakers and actors pulled this thing off. It's quite a feat. I go see a lot of movies in the theater as its my preferred viewing venue, and this is easily one of the most enjoyable movie-going experiences I've ever had. Avengers: Endgame begs to be seen in the theater. This is the masterpiece we were all hoping for. Kudos to everyone involved. 10/10."
1029,"If you are a Marvel fan, you are not going to be disappointed after watching this movie. Although it is 3 hours long, it doesn't really seem that long. This film could have been longer than that. In fact, it should have been. The movie keeps you waiting for 2 and half hour without any big action scene. But you never get bored. That is the strongest side of this movie I suppose. And it pays off extremely well in the last minutes of the film. The experience it gives is unforgettable. The ending is so heart touching."
1030,Nothing negative to say. Some of the folks writing negatives reviews take these things too literally.
1031,"Someone told me that this film is like a roller coaster of emotions and sincerely there is no better way to describe it.[換行字元][換行字元]It is a wonderful cocktail of action, drama, comedy and intrigue, why not. It has you during the 3 hours that the film lasts (more or less, if we remove the credit titles), stuck to the seat, without giving you a break to get bored.[換行字元][換行字元]You go from scenes in which you are uprooting laughter, to others in which you put your eyes as plates and hallucinates and the next, you are with the tear jumped or a pinch in the heart, then you start clapping hands full.[換行字元][換行字元]It has been a round movie, where they have put all the meat in the spit, they have thrown the house by the window, they have imported very little the budget and they have burned all the cartridges at once, provoking a fascinating artistic explosion and that in no moment you lost interest in what was happening on screen.[換行字元][換行字元]It has been a film to laugh, cry and be surprised, of reunions and farewells, victories and defeats.[換行字元][換行字元]A perfect closure for The Avengers."
1032,"I mean not sure why these films get rated so high! getting almost 9/10 for a film which is a 7/10 at best. Didn't even finish watching all the film, are we really saying this film is on par with LOTR, Inception etc.."
1033,"Reaching for the stars, failed to take off from the orbit."
1034,To be honest this movie doesn't look like avenger. Is about family fight together. Talking about family someone should make a movie about thanos life how gamora fin her.
1035,It is really the best marvel movie ever made. They really planned so good to make the audience experience several feelings. Grief and sence of oppression then happy moments then prepare you to the very end and let these things happen.
1036,"Avengers: Endgame takes place after the grave events of Avengers: Infinity War(2018). The world is in shambles, after Thanos(Josh Brolin) succeeds with his nefarious plan. All the remaining Avengers reunite to stop Thanos, no matter what the consequences.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers: Endgame is a mind-blowing film. Directors Anthony Russo & Joe Russo have given us an absolutely satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga, which consists of all 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies which have released, so far. The emotional moments make you shed a tear or two. Don't worry though. The comedic moments are aplenty, as well. The effortless chemistry & the banter among all the Avengers, remains intact. The action set pieces are glorious. The climactic set piece is the highlight of the film. You will cheer till you no longer can, as so many moments will bring you pure & unadulterated joy! The visual effects are brilliant. The 3D is eye-popping. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Chris Evans is outstanding as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Chris Hemsworth is incredible as Thor. Scarlett Johansson is unforgettable as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is superb as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Don Cheadle is effective as James Rhodes/War Machine. Paul Rudd is amazing as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Brie Larson is awesome as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. Karen Gillan is awe-inspiring as Nebula. Danai Gurira is impressive as Okoye. Bradley Cooper is hysterical as Rocket. Josh Brolin is flawless as Thanos. The supporting cast is scene-stealing in their respective roles. Avengers: Endgame is a must watch. Go & experience this action-packed, hilarious, emotional & wholesomely entertaining rollercoaster ride of a film. My all-time favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe movie & the best superhero film, of all time. Absolutely jaw-dropping stuff!"
1037,Good movie will watch again very fun easy to watch
1038,"Inferior to Infinity war, nowhere in the same category. Felt plastic, rushed and untrue to most characters (looking at you Thor). All the 10/10 reviews are lazy, infantile or fake. Honestly, Winter Soldier, Civil War and Infinity War feel like they were done by a different group of people alltogether compared to this.[換行字元][換行字元]Zero sense of grandeur or dignity in this."
1039,"Incredible, just incredible. The best Marvel release to date and that I can say with certainty without thinking twice..."
1040,"Not as satisfying that i was hoping. It was mainly good, but comedy din't work at all and fatshaming Thor for laughts was just lame. Infinity War better, but at least ending was not messed up GoT style. Captain Marvel was lame and less of her would have been better. After this i don't think Marvel has anything interesting to offer anymore outside home coming and guardians 3."
1041,"When I saw Endgame, it was totally worth the two hour wait. It was beautifully told and while we said goodbye to some of the best characters ever, it was still a masterpiece."
1042,"This film is the collectiveness of so many characters, memories and emotions. You cant simply make this. It is everything I'd hoped and prayed it would be.[換行字元][換行字元]Marvel you have truly out done yourselves.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you"
1043,Avengers endgame was really really good. I think it is just as Good as Avengers infinity war.
1044,This is a good movie in terms of all its technical background but there is a lack of feel and energy throughout the film except for the scenes towards the end. You just needs to sit and wait patiently for the final battle. If you are a Marvel fan then you will enjoy it like any other Marvel films otherwise it can get sort of boring surely an overrated film.
1045,Very cool movie! very emotional and beautiful film!
1046,"Avengers: Endgame is less of a movie and more of an event. It celebrates 11 years of superhero cinema while also commemorating itself as just a huge, huge event. As something like this, it works very well. As a movie, on the other hand, there are severe flaws.[換行字元][換行字元]Now that isn't to say that I hate Avengers: Endgame- in fact, I really enjoyed the film. However, as genuinely enjoyable as the second half is, the first half is slow-paced, lifeless, and drags on. Sure, that's the intention given the fact that half of life only remains, but that doesn't aid in the fact that it still feels a bit long and disjointed at times. It doesn't quite have a flowing narrative or genuine structure, it just plays out as a series of overemotional filler.[換行字元][換行字元]The second half (and the time travel scenes), on the other hand, is immensely fun and entertaining. I'm not here to talk time-travel mumbo jumbo so I'm gonna be ignoring those flaws, The climax and the aftermath of it are both incredible and really give the film its identity; a huge, grand-scale spectacle of a film and a sight to behold.[換行字元][換行字元]In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame is a far from perfect movie, but it's still solid and delivers a spectacular ending for not just itself, but for the MCU. It will go down as a classic, that's for sure, but for now, the MCU is a story of a lifetime.[換行字元][換行字元]Rating: A-"
1047,"Best movie ever, really? Is it the only movie you have seen or even the only marvel movie you have seen? 10/10's are just not being serious. Far too boring , comic movies must be fun and this film is light on that."
1048,"There is no way there can be so many legit 10 votes for the movie. Seems like a hoax to me.[換行字元][換行字元]It was so bad. Infinity war was way better.[換行字元][換行字元]I went to see it partly because of the high rating, never trusting imdb ratings again. The studio must have fixed some high ratings to induce ticket sales.[換行字元][換行字元]Massive waste of time and money."
1049,"Let me start of by answering some retorical questions: Is this the greatest Marvel movie ever made? YES, hands down the best movie ever made by Marvel. Is this the greatest movie ever made in general? Well it doesn't apply to all people so maybe only for those who actually watched all the previous Marvel movies, YES, but i can say even overall it is the greatest movie ever. Is this the best super hero movie ever created? YES, last year at this time I thought nothing can beat Infinity War, I was so wrong. Best super hero movie ever. And now the big question, will it beat Avatar's box office record? This movie has the biggest and only chance so far to beat Avatar, there's not a single movie at this moment that can beat Avatar other than Endgame. But will it? It has the biggest chance ever, and i can assure you it will.[換行字元][換行字元]Now about the movie overall. I cannot describe in words what i just witnessed, I literally can't. Nobody who actually watched can do that and i can assure you that. I never laughed so much and so hard at a movie, I never in my life i swear to GOD, I never in my life cried at a movie, this is the first movie ever to make me cry and trust me I watched a lot of movies. This is also the first time when i see a cinema room completly full, i saw it today 25th of april at the preview in my country in IMAX, a room full of 400 people who wanted to see the culmination of 11 years and 21 movies as much as I wanted too. The first time when in my country, Romania, i see people clapping and actually screaming out of joy together. There were like 3-4 moments were everybody in the cinema clapped and screamed together because of how amazing that scene was. I will not spoil it for you. I will not tell you anything about this movie at all, you will have to see it for yourselvs. I will just tell you this one thing, you are not prepared for what you are going to see. Nobody was and nobody will ever be.[換行字元][換行字元]Hands down the greatest experience of my life, I will never forget it my whole life. I will tell my kids, grandkids and all the people til i die that i the opportunity to witness this in the first day in IMAX with other 400 people. Greatest cinematic event in history."
1050,One word to describe it : BEAUTIFUL. No superhero movie like this. Ever. Never write a review before in my entire life. But this one is an exception. The MCU Project has never been this ambitious before. Crazzzyyyy
1051,"The only reason I'm giving 10/10 rating is because of the bond I have with these characters in the past 11 years. If this has been any other movie I'd probably given it 8/10. Overall the movie was great, it was funny, emotional, and had action sequences. However, I personally think that the start was slow in terms of action and as compared to Infinity war. Anyway it is a must watch movie for any individual but specially for a true marvel fan who has been following MCU during these 11 years!"
1052,"Marvel wanted to give its fans a fantastical adventure that finished the arch of the avengers and they blew it out of the water!! This film is the best fan service any company has ever given to a single audience. Endgame brings stellar MCU action along with the best character development seen in this franchise. This flick has the best third act of any MCU film and completed each character arch in unique and perplexing ways that are both expected and unexpected at the same time. This is one of the few films I have seen that I walked out of the theater with a new ticket purchased for the next day's first showing just to watch it again. It is truly the definition of epic and is the biggest and best blockbuster ever put together. This film pays off big time. Watch this movie. If you don't you're missing out on an amazing cinematic event that will leave you with the greatest feeling of overwhelming emotions and happiness. Each character is beautiful and each sacrifice is worthy. The avengers are truly epic. The avengers finally assemble. The world finally fights back. And yes, ""I am Iron man""(Tony Stark)."
1053,"He's right. Basically everything he wrote above. The movie was entertaining and well worth the time, but it doesn't deserve a rating higher than decent.[換行字元][換行字元]And oh.. don't pay for it. Free stream it. NEVER support the greedy milking ****s at Disney corp."
1054,I love this movie. ..hope there will be another one like this
1055,"Endgame felt like a heartfelt love letter to all the comic book movies that preceded it. If there is a must-see movie in the last ten years, it's this one. Although it provides some of the most crowd pleasing moments in the saga, everything seems earned thanks to the writing and directing of this ultimate blockbuster."
1056,"Terrible movie. I have never been a big fan, of Marvel and even less of MCU, but there were several good movies within that universe.... but this one as the Infinity Gauntlet, destroyed all.... No sense to talk about, the respect of the comic source.... but Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and many others involved on their comic origin of the characters has to be suffering in hell seeing how their creations were terribly undermined....... but just analizing from a cinematographic point of view, this film has a terrible argument, script, direction and very poor characters.... 2 hours of the film were not needed, and all the structure that were builded for this collapsed with this ending. Plot holes and nonsense everywhere.[換行字元][換行字元]This film represents what social media can do.... in a bad way. Stay away, if you can."
1057,"This is a very well done movie not as good as infinity war but still good, you shouldn't watch if you haven't seen a marvel film before"
1058,"Overall its a good movie and may be an okay finale, it seems like the Seinfeld finale, after a great run a disappointing end, the movie story didnt have fluidity and seems the writers just wanted to finish all endings quickly rather than the smooth flow like in infinity war"
1059,One of the best movie ever..must watch.. vfx was superb
1060,"First things first, I must admit that 3H is very long for the bladder. A good 40-60 minutes aka the build up phase were focused on PTSD from Civil/Infinity War and overcoming it by using Ant Man Quantum Realm as a catalyst to the story. There are some funny moments but it's a safe bet to run into the nearest toilet and not miss much. I think the trailer give it all away. If you were able to somehow skip pr didn't watch the trailer, the effect would be much more enjoyable.[換行字元][換行字元]Now, the remaining aspects of Endgame were simply Marvelous! The plot might be as simple as stop Thanos from gathering the stones by getting it first, yet the duo Russo Evil geniuses managed to pull down a magnificent script so godly connecting more than a dozen movies to one cohesive story. So many plot twists kept it from being predictacle, it's awesome to delve into relationships that were unthinkable at first glance.You could also felt each cast fighting their hearts out and resolving all these deep emotional encounters.[換行字元][換行字元]Art and directions were all top notch and oh man the action scenes were so EPIC and massive in scope. It'd be a waste not to watch in the big screen.[換行字元][換行字元]Also, the pinnacle of this movie lies on Thanos performance. Endgame really show how he could remain calm and collected, his ability as a master strategist, all while possessing unyielding conviction to his ideals not losing to any of the Avengers even on his unavoidable true death. All these qualities make Thanos the best Supervillain in the MCU, period![換行字元][換行字元]Overall, YES i would recommend to watch Endgame at least once. I only deduce 1 star because of the 180 minutes mark, and one because maybe it's just me but some action are out of nowhere and felt like trolling.[換行字元][換行字元]PS also need MOARRR Brie Lawson 😘[換行字元][換行字元]PPS I left saddened knowing this era is going to end, how some deaths are real and how other upcoming superhero movies needed to up their game to left a lasting impression now that this epic saga was concluded."
1061,"One of the fastest 3 hours of my life... and without any Doubt one of the best Experiences i've Had in Cinema in A long time, Great ending to an outstanding series."
1062,Mcu deserve an ending like that. Russo brothers are did their best
1063,"There are some very good moments in Endgame and that's coming from a long standing MCU fan growing up with these movies. In creating an extensive and emotional journey for a lot of the MCU characters, it absolutely succeeds. Respect for the Russo Brothers for taking the direction they did with Endgame and it really does satisfy but Infinity War is overall a more entertaining movie. It's not the best MCU movie but I can't dispute its great conclusion."
1064,I was hooked from begin to end didn't even realize it was 3 hours intact I could of watched more. I laughed intact the whole cinema did and I cried. It was simply brilliant and yeah I could sit here and nit pick plot holes etc but I'm not all and all it was a brilliant end to the infinity stones saga and I definitely can't wait to see were Marvel go next.
1065,It could have been slightly shorter... but the end is epic
1066,Its a masterpiece. A perfect movie. Emotional and full of action rollar coaster ride. Please go and watch .
1067,"I had very high hopes for this film and it blew them out of the water! Marvel did a really great job with the story line and keeping it action packed through out the whole 3 hours. Well done Marvel, well done. I can't wait to see it again!! This movie has become my baseline for reviews of all other movies. This movie was a 12 in my book!!!"
1068,"Movie was awesome, these 1/10 reviews, i bet they haven't seen more than 20 movies in whole life...epic movie..."
1069,Não se tratou de um filme mas de um marco cultural pop cinematográfico.
1070,"Came in with high expectations (oh man, the hype was real) and the movie did not disappoint. After seeing every single trailer, and reading a ton of theories, despite knowing where we were being led to I was constantly getting surprised, and not knowing exactly what was coming next turn kept me at the edge of my seat.[換行字元][換行字元]I laughed a lot, I cried a couple times, I raised my hands a couple more while shouting ""YES!!!"" -it was such a roller coaster of emotions. Particularly the third act kept me shivering, my heart pounding so hard in my chest, just hoping not to have a stroke until the credits finished rolling. Marvel did it again: made us, a considerable bunch of grown-ups turning in for midnight premiere, leave the premises with wet eyes. It's true what they say: it is a brilliantly, beautiful, well-crafted love letter to us Marvel fans who have grown together with these characters. Oh boy, what a hell of a ride it has been.[換行字元][換行字元]There are a couple of complaints I could raise. Not spoiling anything away, maybe one of the characters could have been developed a bit differently. Also the pacing (while not crammed) might be confusing if you don't keep your eyes wide open. The fate of a couple of heroes also left me scratching my head a little. But I guess they are trying something different, instead of resorting to the same old story-telling formulas, so I think all that can be forgiven, although I do understand where people ranking this one 8/10 come from.[換行字元][換行字元]Worth re-watching, might be even necessary. At this point I think it's pointless to say if this movie is better than that one and what not. Most MCU movies hold their own unique place. And this one does. It delivers, and more. And it signs off brilliantly these 11 years and 22 films of wonder that will remain with us forever."
1071,"I think Thor said it best in the previous film=[換行字元][換行字元]""This is farewell and good luck, morons."""
1072,"I cried. I laughed. I was shocked. My expectations were blown away. Perfection, enough Said."
1073,What a film from start to finish. As per usual Marvel have gone and done it again.. Best film by a mile
1074,Avengers: Endgame will take you to another level of superheroes movie. This movie is a complete package of emotions and this is an epic story to end the Infinity Saga
1075,This was a very well written movie. I had my own theory on what I thought was going to happen but was proven wrong. It's definitely an emotional rollercoaster. Enjoy!
1076,"Hands down, the best Marvel movie I've seen. Longer runtime benefit a lot with this film. We had more time to see more characters developments of Black Widow, Hawkeye, Hulk, Thor, Rocket, Nebula, Tony Stark, and Steve (Capt). I loved them all, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man stole the show, same goes with Chris Hemsworth, and Chris Evan portrayal of their characters. This is more of a Avengers movie than Thanos like we seen in Infinity War. Brie Larson did a wonderful job as Captain Marvel. She's not in this movie a lot surprisingly. This movie came a lot of surprises. The third act of the movie is freaking epic! One of the best scenes in history. OH MY GOD! I loved it so much, I can tell you it's totally fan service. You'll love it as well. Avengers: End Game is a satisfying ending and a great set up for the future of the Marvel universe! People are going to be talking about this movie a lot more than Infinity War. This game is going down to the history books. The movie lived up so much expectations. I can't wait to see it again. 5/5 for me!"
1077,"This movie coud be shorter on some parts at a begining and give us more of these awsome fight scenes. At first i was woried that it could be boring, but after some time to me it was realy great!! And ended so much beter than i expected!! I loved it :)"
1078,10 years of storytelling converged into one epic finale! The closest a movie can get to perfection. Thank you Stan Lee and Jack Kirby!
1079,"The movie awesome don't miss out especially for marvel fans . For general audience also this movie will give a fantastic experience, the core of the movie is the climax, this movie have a ultimate and emotional ending from other 22 marvel movies."
1080,"How can I talk about The Avengers End Game without spoiling anything. Each and every actor has brought their best moments of determination, sacrifice, and the will to never give up as quoted by them in the trailer ""Whatever it takes"" to bring back everyone they loved, and the responsibility for failing to stop Thanos in Infinity War when he snapped 15% of the human population on earth out of existence. Story ties in all together in this final epic saga. Furthermore, I'm looking forward to our next installment and next phase of the MCU with Spiderman: Far from home."
1081,"It would be impossible to talk about this movie without spoiling anything, but this is truly the Endgame. Avengers: Endgame felt like the closing of a chapter and the culmination of a decades worth of movies and a truly epic saga. We have followed these characters for 22 movies and it has all led to this movie, a combination of heart wrenching drama and epic action sequences.[換行字元][換行字元]As a comic book reader/fan there really is something about seeing a movie like this that evokes a certain emotion in you, while I have enjoyed pretty much all of the MCU films this and movie and the first Avengers did something that is entirely on its own level. In the Avengers, seeing the moment in which the Avengers first 'assemble', there is a very emotional response. This movie has a similar moment that evokes that same emotion of seeing the characters you have known and love from the comics come to life on the screen. Endgame truly felt like a large comic book crossover event that ties everything together satisfyingly.[換行字元][換行字元]While this film definitely has 'plot holes' and flaws, to me it is a 10/10 film because I truly doubt that anyone would be able to recreate the magic that this film represents, 22 movies in over a decade, this saga represents more than a single cinematic motion picture can accomplish but elevates the artform of 'film' and forges its own category of epic sagas."
1082,It was inevitable that Infinity War set up too big a plotline for it to not be somewhat disappointing in the conclusion. Very sentimental (too sentimental?). These will not be popular opinions. Oh well.
1083,"The people how got these job got overwelmed and starter messing up every single thing, they stetched the movie to nowhere, leading to events that don't make any sense... true fans will feel that this was a kick in the stomach... I'm just disapointed.[換行字元][換行字元]Simply a spit on Stan Lee's grave."
1084,"Great movie but i must say infinity war was the best MCU film ever. Although this movie had more goosebumps than infinity war.But infinity war kept our eyes glued.Captain America steals the show,steals my girl,my car and everything.. But it was Thor and Hulk.The two most powerful Avengers yet they ruined them. And start was booring with the quantum realm thing.But the Battle was one of the biggest battle i've seen in theatre and also the greatest."
1085,Incredible movie and an amazing way to wrap up 11 years of great movies! An achievement!
1086,"This film had everything! Action, comedy, stake, emotion, surprises and fan service.[換行字元][換行字元]The film didn't feel like 3 hours either[換行字元][換行字元]Hard to write much for this without giving anything away![換行字元][換行字元]Fully worth a watch! For more impact, watch the others before hand or else you will be confused and there will be bits that won't land or will go over your head"
1087,"What can I say the title says it all, the director is really screwed up with the hulk he didn't even have a decent fight scene. The story it was kind of boring also fell asleep practically in the middle of the movie. This movie felt like a Hollywood director made it instead of a real fan the way it should have been made. And the CGI was horrible"
1088,"Avengers Endgame was the end of an era, 22 movies made to get a big legendary resolution on this one. As a huge Marvel fan, I could not be more grateful for this movie, they focused on the original six avengers and brought a massive nostalgia to the fans who have been following this journey for the past 11 years. When I watched Avengers Endgame for the first time, it was the most surreal movie experience I had ever had. Everyone in the movie theater was screaming, crying, celebrating and clapping, I could easily compare it to reactions we get on World Cup Finales. Definitely a experience to remember, and it proves how much this movie touched our hearts! The characters get an epic ending, even though some of them didn't get the happiest one. It concluded a enormous saga and started a new one. Marvel did a fantastic job and it's a movie you'll feel lots of different emotions, but on a whole, you'll feel proud of being part of something as big as the Avengers."
1089,"I had very high expectations for this movie and absolutely no ideas on how they were gonna fix the situation created in 'Infinity War' but, again, MARVEL exceeded any expectation no matter how high or impossible they were and has done it perfectly. They managed to create a story for this movie, but at the same time also paying an omage to the original three trilogies giving, by this, a sense of closure for these characters. Every character had its own moment and place to shine throughout the movie. This is how the story ends and it's perfect, because this is how it's supposed to end: every character chose it's own destiny for once and it's incredibly sad and heartbreaking, but in the end it's the right thing. In conclusion, this is the greatest movie I've ever seen, thank you MARVEL."
1090,"AVENGERS ENDGAME exceeded all expectations. A Culmination of 11 years of Movie making, Marvel Studios wraps it all up with a film of truly Epic proportions. Many of us comic fans and moviegoers care about the characters and their individual and collective plights. We have been part of this journey with them. This film delivers on so many levels. It is action-packed but isn't just an action film. It has a real human element with heart and soul. The various story lines of all the films over the last decade have converged to this finale and they gift wrap it, put a bow on it and then blow us away. I am truly fortunate to have been a part of it all. Two Thumbs (both of mine) waaaaaaaaaaaaaay up !!"
1091,"Definitely not as good as its predecessor but one to be conjured with nevertheless. The movie starts a bit slower than all MCU movies before it and it takes its precious time to get the action going, but once it does, its all forgiven and forgotten. Although predictable, because let's face it, where could they go after Infinity Wars? It delivers on all fronts! There were tears and laughter throughout the 3 hr long feature. The tears yanked out of you by Ant Man, Stark, Cap and Hawkeye and the laughter mainly by Thor who surprised everybody with his transformation, but also by Hulk/Banner who found a peaceful way to co-exist. There were cameos sprinkled throughout the whole length of the movie, some very emotional, like Agent Carter, who actually didn't have to say a single word to get the tears flowing. They tied up all the loose ends, revisited some great scenes from past beloved movies and, thankfully, did not give all the glory to insipid Captain Marvel, who despite being the most powerful of all the Avengers, delivers quite a forgettable performance. There are some key characters who will definitely not be coming back, but there is still plenty left for future plots. Although it will feel a lot less exciting with some of the most beloved characters absent from now on.[換行字元][換行字元]All considered, a very good movie to end it all, one that you may want to watch it again to take it all in as I will be doing. Well done to all involved and a great big thank you for such a ride that spanned for over 10 years."
1092,"I am definitely disappointed after the epic Infinity War movie, perhaps I had my hopes too high, I don't know. However this was a snooze fest! The first 45 mins is all filler and the last 15-20 mins after the big battle was excruciating all fan service and slow paced intending to pull at your emotions but I (and many others) felt nothing. I really felt like this movie never picked up and focused too much on romantic drama that it lost its humorous edge that the last movie had. The laughs in my sold out theater was sparse and underwhelming. It also became predictable with a lot of plot holes. The big death at the end felt forced. There was no reason for it. Overall this movie fell flat, I can't believe there are such high reviews across the board."
1093,Lots of unanswered plot holes where the time travel theory doesn't really make any Sense. It enjoyable as other marvel movies but as it's endgame it's lacking some ingredients.
1094,"This is my own opinion, but so many things that didn't make sense in that movie... like so much stuff that could've been utilised in a better way and so many stupid things that were put on wrong hands. The image and the graphics are really good but the plot is weak. Emotionally I give a 9/10 Graphics I give a 9/10 Storyline I give a 3/10"
1095,"Such a Epic Movie Of MCU. I don't have enough word to describe the movie but it was epic,fabulous,marvelous,mind blowing,Awesome.. Just go and watch!!! Just watch!!!"
1096,"I have loved watching all the marvel films to date and this latest one did not disappoint. With Disney stating there will be 8 more films, only makes me happy! The world needs superheroes, AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!!!"
1097,"The conclusion that we have been waiting for, super awesome!"
1098,"Had everything you could ever want from a film, emotion, comedy an amazing way to tie up some historical storylines"
1099,"A tremendous production, with lame script, very obvious and almost boring time line, I hardly kept my eyes open to watch it to the end. The movie was also too long for the poor content. They could have told that sorry in 1,5 hours. Oh my God... and Thor... seriously? Is it a joke? And captain America holding his hammer... that finally destroyed the image of the great Thor. Pity!"
1100,"It's hard to rate this movie in any fair way. As a movie in itself it's maybe not the most fantastic thing you've seen, it's no Pulp Fiction, Her or Forest Gump. But as a movie in a series of films this is amazing. The different stories that has been told through Marvels characters all come together here in a perfectly balanced way. As all things should be.[換行字元][換行字元]Seeing grown up men and women laughing, crying and cheering for their favourite hero is something I find fascinating and it's hard to find this kind of interaction in the cinemas. I simply love it."
1101,"This is so not ok! It is extremely bad! On so many different levels, this is awful!"
1102,No words. What an INCREDIBLE JOURNEY!! Go watch the movie as blind as possible.
1103,I have never seen like that before. Macnificent. This film is better than other films. until Lord of the rings.
1104,"Endgame fell short of being the fantastic end that everyone wanted it to be. It had a really slow first third and just when it got going the writers cram some sour brie cheese down the audience's throat, jarring the audience off the edge of their seats. In a repetitive pattern the main characters are constantly thrust situations of peril to be ""saved"" by the timely annoyed arrival of brie cheese. As for the rest of the cast this movie was great well preformed and exactly what you want in a marvel movie up until the next serving of brie cheese."
1105,"Well if I went back in time and told my 14 year old self about this film as she watched the first Iron Man...well she would have been disappointed. This was a horrible, boring film. Waited this long for the film equivalent of a root canal, painful, boring, and way overpriced. Don't feel ashamed if you didn't like this ""film"""
1106,"This was absolutely the best possible way the universe could of ended. Acting was amazing, directing flawless. 10/10"
1107,"Not what it was pumped up to be. Captain Marvel, useless. Thor, broken. Stark, hitting well above his weight. Captain America annoying as ever. Ant-Man, completely left out of the loop. Hulk, not incredible at all."
1108,Didn't think they would beat Infinity War but man they did. By far THE GREATEST MARVEL FILM EVER MADE.
1109,"It just blown my mind up. I screamed till i cant no more. I cried, laughed, shooked. Endgame just broken the mold. Best superhero movie ever"
1110,"We needed an additional 30 minutes to fill the story and make it ""complete""."
1111,Great but confusing[換行字元][換行字元]I'm bored I dunno what to do now Pfffff
1112,Thank you for making us happy and satisfied. It's worth waiting for. 🍻
1113,"Though the film was a superb ending to a superb saga of films with the high and lows of emotions through all and endgame is no exception to this. I had tears of joy, and sadness. This film was delivered perfectly and you can tell they have listened to us and incorporated their ideas. AMAZING!"
1114,"What an amazing film this was a great way to end an 11 year old legacy such an emotional, shocking and touching film. This film is definitely worth the watch Marvel have outdone themselves with this film congrats to Marvel for making such an amazing legacy and an outstanding conclusion."
1115,First thing is Thor is a stronger character that can make huge changes without stark's Death Second thing is captain America can have Thor's power because oden whispered to his hamer that one will have it only So the mistakes I saw there was Thor was useless and captain America got his power Third thing is captain marvel didn't make any changes so the purpose of this character is making money !!!!
1116,"With exception of handful actors play and CGI, this movie lacks in all aspects, thus making it outright pointless."
1117,This is the best film I've ever seen from the beginning of the film marvel until this film many scenes that amazed me
1118,"I am stunned by the 10+ years of the MCU and how they were able to bring it all together. Magnificent! However, I hate Captain Marvel. I shudder to wonder what will come of the MCU under her guidance and direction. Black Widow could have/ should have carried the torch. Please don't make any more Captain Marvel movies. I'm begging you."
1119,This a garbage movie with no sense at all...nothing justified...too way boring...very little action at the last 45 minutes and still nothing impressive...i will not waste my time again and continue my review...just do not listen to the postive reviews which i suspect they are not real reviewers...my advice is to save your money and your time as well.
1120,"This movie has everything that fans wanted in MCU, a pure tribute to the previous stories and most satisfying completion of the saga. It is funny, emotional, thrilling, action packed roller-coaster ride. Three hours run-time never felt long, it went by very quickly. I could have happily watched even longer version (I demand a longer version ;) ). The Original six truly shines in this one and great characterization. Stark is just awesome as always, as does Rogers, Thor, Banner, Barton and Romanoff. They started this adventure beautifully and ended this with a bang. Since this is a spoiler free review I won't delve into the conclusion of their individual character arcs but Cap's is although satisfying but still bothering me. There maybe many things which will make more sense or less after more viewing but for now that's all.[換行字元][換行字元]""Part of the journey is the end"""
1121,Absolutely incredible and creative movie. It takes risks beyond our minds and gives the fans a movie to enjoy.
1122,The film with the number of heros it shows looks like a show? Each want to say I am here in the film ! Nothing new ? It seems media played a lot in creating a mass positive thinking ! Long for 3 hours. A lot of talk that can be removed without affecting the film story? Its a kids film.
1123,"Spoiler free review here.[換行字元][換行字元]If you are invested at all in any of the Marvel characters, than this is a must see. It was a perfect conclusion to the first three phases of the MCU and it makes us wonder where they can go next that'll feel new and fresh. Worth watching, ignore the haters and negative reviews. Sure there are plot holes but we're talking about a universe in which a guy created his own element and an entire country uses a metal as basically magic and says its technology. Every Marvel movie has plot holes, this one is no exception."
1124,"A long, light, fan-service of a movie that is stuck between; concluding a decade long narrative; and kicking off new storylines tethered to decades old comic plots. As I left Infinity War a year ago I knew the Russo brothers will have to resolve the problem they have made for Marvel fans with its ending, but the first 2 acts of the Endgame took a shortcut that left me feeling cheated. The movie also fully retorts back to the old, light and humorous MCU movies tone, and due to its multitude of concluding goals its tempo was convoluted and rushed, leading it to let go of its new-found, bold and nuanced 'Inifinity War' approach. Aparantly the movie makers chose to pay tribute to their journey, while honouring expiring contracts rather than venture further into new terrains as they did in the last movie. The final scenes, although strong in implementation, are easily anticipated, while being a bit socially charged. The end scenes try to leave us with a sentimental sense that was ill-prepared for. I was also looking for a stronger tribute to Stan Lee. That being said, it was not boring. The movie does induce many laughs and tears, and serves its purpose of ending the long series well...and might even deserve a second watching."
1125,What to say Awesome❤ Powerful fight❤ But I think little logic mistake.. Whatever. Movies is very nice❤
1126,This is what we were waiting for... A perfect end for this chapter of Marvel movies. Wait and looking for new heroes. Best Comic movie ever. BCME
1127,Once is not enough to watch this movie. It blew me away.
1128,Avengers Endgame truly lives up to the hype and more.
1129,"I really love the movie. The film is better than all I can think of. I really like the saying: ""i love you 3 thousands times"
1130,"No one would have bought justice to the character of Iron Man than Robert Downey Jr, himself. Same goes for Chris Evans and the others. Felt the movie deep down in the nerve from the start. what an epic conclusion, totally worth the wait and time. I repeat 10 years in making, and Marvel delivered the BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE TILL DATE. Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans deserved the farewell they deserved. I just got out of the theatre and I can't control my emotions. It's running high and low, no words to describe. The adrenaline burst is damn on. Thank you marvel. And yes, love you 3000 Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr, will miss you boss."
1131,"Always such a perfect balance between standard serious scenes and comic relief-scenes. Otherwise, couldn't have ended better. Nice way to finish what was started by the great Stan Lee."
1132,It's sad to the last final movie with the original Avengers cast but what an ending. I highly recommend to watch this film. Probably the best marvel movie of all time.
1133,"The culmination of the infinity saga,this movie is going down in history as one of its kind. MIND-BLOWING MASTERPIECE.Words can't describe the grandiosity of this film. Worth watching more than once."
1134,"Fitting end to this part of the franchise. Everything you would expect from Marvel. Fun laughs, action and some tears. Really enjoyed this."
1135,Best film ever? Best film ever. BEST FILM EVER? BEST FILM EVER.
1136,I liked it. That's all folks. This is too short so let me just say that it was a really cool film and had a lot of twists my fav character is hulk. You'll see why if you watch the movie
1137,This is the best movie by far watch thisbsbsbsbebbebbebb
1138,I loved it. cap was really good in this movie. best super hero movie ever made.
1139,"Great battle, effect, story and characters THE BEST MOVIE I EVER HAD"
1140,This has an awesome plot twist. It is action packed and funny.
1141,"Before Endgame, The Dark Knight Rises was my best superhero of all time. But now without any doubt I can clearly say that this is the best movie ever made. Every single second of my life that I've spent watching this movie worth it. The ending made me a little sad but I think every journey has an end."
1142,It was a good movie but there just too much hype surrounding it. I'm giving it 10 stars because of the actresses and actors.
1143,Emotional. Heart-wrenching. Imperfect. Astounding. Joyous. Scarring. Satisfying.
1144,The best marvel movie till date ... simply an epic I mean it is an epic.
1145,"I've been a fan of the MCU for about seven years now and going into this movie, I knew it was going to be an emotional roller coaster. This movie met all of my expectations and had unexpected turns. This is a must see for any fan of the MCU and for superhero and movie buffs in general. If you don't see this movie, you're crazy!"
1146,"This movie is a complete masterpiece! It is excellently acted, directed, and animated. It is an amazing payoff of all the previous marvel movies coming together."
1147,"This is a movie best enjoyed on the Big screen, with a large audience. We can nitpick and overanalyze small plot details, but overall, Marvel Studios has delivered a great experience. To tie all these movies together, as best they could, is no small achievement. As more people continue to stay home and stream content, this movie is a reminder of the true power of cinema."
1148,As a MASSIVE Marvel fan going in to this was like winning the lottery. Was it good though? It was (and I'm still thinking if it is) possibly the best marvel movie I've ever seen. So the short way to rave about this film is take every film from the MCU and take everything that's good about it and turn it into a masterpiece. I mean I love this movie 3000 😏. It has lots of humour some heart breaking moments and great action including the third act which is like a geeks wedding day. I cried (a lot which is no surprise 😏) I laughed a lot and sat there a lot going OH MY GOD. I really recommend it. GO WATCH IT.
1149,"This movie is by far the best superhero movie of all time , trust me"
1150,"Never has a sequel or franchise been so complete. Perfect writing, perfect effects, perfect stunts. So many call backs with payoffs. There were grown men and women weeping. And all your wishes and expectations have come through."
1151,"WOW!!! End Game, that film blew me away, It's truly a MASTERPIECE of cinema & not just of the comic book world, i was amazed at how beautiful & devastating this movie was & how deeply it affected me!!! I'm massively into the ""Avengers"" movies but not so much all the characters own films as there's so many, but the ones i have seen have all been excellent, Captain America & Hawkeye are my favourite characters of the Avengers team & I've loved all the Avengers films right upto ""End Game"" & then just WOW!!![換行字元][換行字元]This is a very dark & apocalyptic fantasy Thriller, all the stakes are higher & the atmosphere is of sadness & loneliness, Clint aka Hawkeye really feels like the heart of this particular Avengers film as we see him as the ordinary & loving Family man who loses his family & becomes a dangerous vigilante, Hawkeye uses his skills to hunt & kill criminals & you feel his sadness,his anger & his despair & Jeremy Renner gives the best performance so far as the troubled Hawkeye, it's a dark path for a complex character & that's just the start of End Game. Captain America is the main big beating heart behind all this darkness & Chris Evans gives his most powerful performance so far as cap, Black Widow has some extremely dark & emotional moments & Tony Stark shows why he's such an important Avenger as well as the smartest!!! Heroes rise & Heroes fall.[換行字元][換行字元]All the characters are fantastic here in End Game, each character is given more depth,drama & emotion so you really care for this team. The apocalyptic world is very eerie with half the people missing, it's creepy & lonely looking, the atmosphere is dark & gloomy & our heroes need to change this world. End Game still has hilarious moments scattered throughout it's huge running time as it does with the amount of emotional drama & action packed scenes, there's never a dull or boring moment i thought as i totally got into this dark new world created by the evil ""Thanos"" The Action is breathtakingly Awesome & the c.g.i fx are Outstanding to the highest quality with it's massive budget put to full use, this is an epic film in every way!!! The visual look is stunning!!! By the End i was an emotional wreck as the characters touched my heart & the action put on screen blew me away, this is the best Avengers movie it's also the ultimate Comic book movie & an instant CLASSIC.[換行字元][換行字元]Just watch it & laugh & cry at a MASTERPIECE of cinema. When it ended i felt a big sense of loss,sadness & Happiness & that's how this masterpiece grabs you by the heart!!!"
1152,"Avengers Endgame is one of the most excellent film that has ever been made this 21st century. With all of the 22 films culminated in one huge and complex story, the film satisfies the international community with an emotional and still an action-packed film that everyone will never forget, marking the end of an old era and giving way for more new characters and stories along the way for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe"
1153,"I had the chance to see this movie twice, midnight of the 23rd and again on the 24th as I live in Egypt and luckily the movie came out early and thank god to that. I will not spoil anything all I can say is the magic of this one marvel movie depended on the acting not on the visual effects. Throughout the movie I had all sorts of feelings from the first 10 seconds of the movie. I honestly don't care about those who keep saying that the ending of the movie was predicted and satisfying to the fans, all I know is this movie took me everywhere emotionally the two times! Thank you marvel studios and Disney for the perfect experience, it was way more than I expected and that is enough for me."
1154,Great movie. I wonder where such great heroes live who rescue humanity? In real world I couldn't find help to rescue myself from torture for last 15 years
1155,"I REALLY loved watching this epic conclusion to one of the most respected franchises of all time. With 'Endgame', this movie has exceeded all expectations for all Marvel fans out there. The Russos, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, and Kevin Feige had a lot of fun assembling this billion-dollar-worthy masterpiece. It can get emotional at times, but it is worth all the fun. 'Endgame' has achieved the top rank that outshines every other MCU movie ever existed. The heroes can think, act, and react because of their challenges they had to go through.[換行字元][換行字元]For Marvel - keep up the good work."
1156,"Yes it's a super hero movie, yes it's a blockbuster but damn, what a movie !!! Laughter, cheering and tears Avengers Endgame should not have resonated with me this way but having been invested in these characters over a decade it was the perfect way to finish. You will be missed old friends but thanks for the memories."
1157,Amazing finale to the infinity saga if your a marvel fan this is a must see
1158,"Perfect movie............,..........,... M..hhhvhhgyhgyyggghhb gyftvyu Jgyggg."
1159,You can see how the story goes in first 10 mins Takes forever to finish
1160,Everything you expect but that 10 times. Throwbacks to previous movies. A movie for the real fans!!
1161,"Bad avengers ever, bad script, 😡 Stay home insted"
1162,There should be 2 movies so much story.. i want to see it again
1163,"Very emotional und fun movie! They did a really great job with this ""last"" one. Can't wait to watch it for the second time on saturday.[換行字元][換行字元]A6!"
1164,"20 movies raised up my expectation from marvel, but the endgame was just a photo album of many actors and actresses who played in a movie with too much dialogues, minimum action scenes, childish plot, flat jokes and predictable events. I had two reservations for this weekend and canceled the other one as soon as I came of theater."
1165,Coulda been done 1m better in an hour or so - too much crap on the hot dog to get a decent bite
1166,"No words to describe, outstanding and simply brilliant"
1167,Everything a comic book fan can ask for and more. It is the most wonderful movie experience anyone can go to and the Russo's has done it all again. But somehow even better.
1168,"Movie story line is well designed. Characters who acted had done their job good. I watched movie in Tamil version, actually it is not good. So my advice to see it in original version, so that we can connect to the movie closely. End credits given to the superheros are nice. This movie has action, love, sentiments, timing comedy, twist and turns are nice and it can easily understanding to all age group of audience. Thanks to Marvel and teams to get such a good story line, packed with all kind of feelings. 3 hrs you gonna enjoy. Initial 25 min need some patience to watch the movie."
1169,Just wow! This is not what you'd excpect at all. The story was wrapped up amazingly. You'll definitely cry at the end and laugh in between. Just salute Marvel!
1170,"Endgame was an eagerly anticipated event (it is an *event*) in my household: family members who saw it before others were assiduous in not revealing spoilers, such was the reverence for the film and not wanting to spoil it for others. Having seen it, I can now understand why.[換行字元][換行字元]I'm so old I remember reading the original Avengers comics, and one of the most satisfying things about Endgame was the fidelity, once again, to the spirit of the original comics and their characters, scripted by Lee and drawn by Kirby or Ditko. This is always a huge relief to a Marvel fan. Evans and Downey can be justifiably proud of the way they incarnated their characters, fleshing out in a very real and human way, the 2-dimensional comic. In fact it is a great effort by the whole cast: there is not one weak performance.[換行字元][換行字元]It's one of the best-crafted films I've ever seen: this statement gives you a clue that it is not the crash-bang, thrill-a-minute extravaganza that we've come to expect from the genre. There are many poignant and tender scenes early on as the dreadful realization of Thanos's actions in Infinity War become apparent. The plot lines are clever, not contrived; with the trademark humour intact, as the action builds to one climax after another. I was looking out for the woke scenes and sure enough, they do come, but are immediately followed and tempered by a thrilling affirmation of the triumph and tragedy of the life of the Hero. What more can you ask for?[換行字元][換行字元]A truly momentous film. Great, even."
1171,"The movie is great. They try to present itself as the ultimatum epic movie and i believe it succeeded. There is an epic moment on every corner.[換行字元][換行字元]The overall plot is a lot of mess, too much fan service and the action is good but could have been much better. A lot of mess in the battle scenes too.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is pure entertaining and fun. Don't bother too much about quality and technical stuff."
1172,"Yes, I loved the movie. Did I like everything in the movie? No! Did I like the plotholes? No! Is the movie still enjoyable with its flaws? Definitely! First thing to note is that all leaks and teasers that were released before the movie actually came out were all pretty much lies. Or they were leaked to deliberately throw us all off. I like that I didn't know what was going to happen. I literally yelled in shock and surprise during many of the unexpected moments. I laughed at others. I definitely cried over many. Not everyone survives this movie, and yes, I cried over every loss, especially since I didn't see them coming.[換行字元][換行字元]I don't want to put spoilers in this review, so it's hard to comment about the one thing I really didn't like how they chose to go with a certain female character. Let's just say they ended the movie with the uncertainty of this favorite gal, and I didn't believe for one second that it would have happened the way it played out. It kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. Probably why I rated 9 starts instead of 10. Of course, I'm sure it will all be rectified in the next sequel in the line for this rowdy group of characters, but that's a long ways away. At least my favorite male character will be in this sequel too, so I'm sure I will enjoy![換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is a must see for anyone who claims to love the MCU, especially if you watched Infitity War. You'll experience the full spectrum of emotions during this roller coaster of a ride. A definite must see."
1173,"There aren't many words to describe how this film made me feel, but it definitely was the perfect ending for the Infinity Saga and it makes me incredibly excited for what is yet to come."
1174,"This film is definitely worth the watch, it has a great balance between; action, emotion, and true reality. A perfect way to end a long time journey. There will be tearful moments but the directors have inserted Easter eggs and comedic elements throughout making the film a rollercoaster of emotion and drawing you in as an audience member. Absolutely Magnificent!!!"
1175,
1176,I aint going to spoil the movie but it was awesome it was worth the 3 hours
1177,"Great movie, just really annoying how they force captain marvel and make her into a ***** and have this scene with all the female heroes only on purpose. it was so forced it made me cringe. marvel wasn't in it that much, but the scenes she were in with dialogue were just horrible, she came off so smug."
1178,This movie is amazing. This movie is the perfect matchup of action and fantastic storytelling. Over 22 films they have created something that will only come once in a life time
1179,Best ever marvel movie. The theatre turned into a stadium after every scene. Too good
1180,"10 years in the making. Well executed, exceeded expectations. Funny, full of heart, and of course action-packed. Perfect ending to an amazing story![換行字元][換行字元]At the end, not a dry eye in the theater."
1181,I love it It's a very good movie to watch I'm from Iran and I love thid movie I follow this movie from the first episode of it
1182,"This movie was the biggest let down and anti climax of all time, I am one of the true marvel fans having grown up with the comics and watching all the big and small screen adaptations however this movie had the hype and potential to be the biggest greatest movie of all time , it wasn't it was rubbish !! And a joke , I felt so strongly about this i created this account just to write a review on this horrible movie . I won't spoil it but it was a rip off and a cheat infinity war was amazing 10/10 but endgame is 1/10 also just to rub salt into the wound there is no end credit cut scene so don't waste your time.... you are welcome,[換行字元][換行字元]I can't believe the money this movie will make and it isn't even any good"
1183,"I don't know where to begin with. I'm speechless after watching the movie! It was simply brilliant without a doubt. I'm not going to spill the beans on who did what and leave spoilers out here. I want you to experience this emotional and action packed journey in all its glory as the story unfolds, and let you deal with everything that this movie has in store for you. I mean it, you'll have to deal with a lot! (It will hit you hard, I promise!).[換行字元][換行字元]Those who haven't watched the previous Marvel movies might be thrown into some unfamiliar territory here and there. But you should be fine(worst case scenario: go home and start a Marvel movie marathon and watch this one again). I could go on and on endlessly if I've to comment on how freakishly amazing the special effects were, how spectacular the action sequences were, how brilliant the actors were etc etc etc..... If you are a true Avengers fan, you are going to have a heavy heart, loads of pride and will be awestruck during the end game, because its big! The biggest we've seen so far.[換行字元][換行字元]Conclusion: Don't miss this gargantuan film, because this is the ultimate showdown that you've been waiting for!

1185,"No Spoilers here, just go see it, It is the best movie ending TO ONE OF OF THE GREATEST MOVIE SERIES EVA"
1186,When I first saw this movie it was the best and there is no movie better than this one!
1187,"Great content, well built, and doesn't seemed rushed."
1188,"Watch it. Just do it. Watch the entire MCU movies, the watch it, and you will feel the perfection in this movie."
1189,"The movie is packed with references that are philosophical, religious and even political at the opposite poles. However, no matter where you stand, if you give it the chance, you will witness an epic of human history that is both fictional and real. This is an experience like no other that is so well executed, that it will be memorable for a very, very long time."
1190,"While superhero movies aren't all known for deep plots or very substantial storytelling, Endgame falls far off the Avenger's franchise and feels way too long and underwhelming. The tone of the movie is stripped down by the long shots and unnecessary plot devices, which are predictable and is a forced way to make spectators feel like it's a satisfying ending, which it definitely isn't. While some characters do get a somehwat satisfying closing, the story feels dull and without the excitement that prompted the other movies until now, every scene is stretched for far longer than it should, the editing isn't condensanding, and while one of the biggest points in Infinity war was the various events happening at the same time, this movie does exactly the opposite, it feels, overall, disappointing. It's not a horrible movie, but not even close to one of Marvel's bests and that's what's most disappointing about it, because it feels like an ending, but not like a closure."
1191,"Just watch it by yourself. This movie has more deep story, and will mix all your feelings as well. Thanks god nowadays kid has a great role model for them and thanks god that i was born into this era when this Comic Book Movie exist."
1192,"I would certainly say that Endgame had a satisfying conclusion to the Saga. I wouldn't say it was the greatest of the film series. It was more the finishing note then a finale. But it was an incredible experience and certainly made me smile and feel content.[換行字元][換行字元]At times it was anticlimactic, But I think that's what I loved most. It was over the top, It was sharp and effective.[換行字元][換行字元]The Story is Over, And we've closed the book. Loved it."
1193,I love it all thanks to marvel and russo brothers. Robert downy junior is best. Ddhcdvhggvxxdggvddffvggggfcxxddddf I am speechless
1194,"I watched it twice and I have to say I found it better the 2nd time. Sure, I could knit pick it apart like the negative Nancy's out there, but my rating is based on how I felt through out and at the end. End Game was a 3 hour roller coaster of emotions and thrills. I left feeling better than I felt after Return of the King. Sad at those lost, but satisfied with how the arch was wrapped up. Perhaps the fight scenes could have lasted longer, perhaps other little things could have been done. I think people are mad mainly because it didn't end the way they wanted. Sometimes great movies take turns we don't like or expect. This one is no exception. All-in-all an epic ending to a 22 movie journey."
1195,"The entire Marvel journey has been well placed together to create a fitting conclusion. The Endgame culmination is a master piece and is a treat to all the fans. It will leave them speechless, satisfied, emotional, thrilled, and thoroughly entertained all at the same time. I never felt like I had been there for 3 hours in the theater. In fact I was almost sad when I sensed the climax approaching."
1196,I don't really know what all the hype is about. Bored watching this as it's the same again just rehashed. Glad to see the back of the Avengers to be honest.
1197,"They did such a great job with infinity War that Endgame wasn't able to deliver on the same level with the added pressure of being the grand finale. Part of the problem I think was that the story was developed to such a large-scale that was hard not to be so episodic, although it probably could have been done a lot better without losing the pacing with long, drawn out and sometimes awkward scenes.[換行字元][換行字元]Some of the scenes felt like the writers didn't know which direction to go with characters and the direction they chose was not quite right. Endgame lacked a lot of the slick and fun banter that made the characters shine in previous movies. The writers had their moments but a lot of it could be pretty cringe-worthy at times.[換行字元][換行字元]I get that everyone needed therapy after Infinity War but it felt a little too depressing for too long. All in all end game was a a good movie and it's evident that that Disney tried to put everything but the kitchen sink in this movie to please the fans which is appreciated. But I would have loved to have seen them spend more time crafting and polishing this into the Crown Jewel it's supposed to be rather than an uncut diamond."
1198,"To me, a project is either good or bad. A Yes, I would recommend this to others or a No, don't waste your time. My reviews are based on my experience and are only my opinion. I hope they help you when deciding what to watch and what to avoid."
1199,"A fitting end to a 22 movie story. It is not a full blown action packed Avengers movie, but what it does, and it does it very well, is wrap up everything in close to 3 hours with respect to everything that's gone before it. No spoilers here, but you'll enjoy the action, laugh at the humour and it will (probably) make you sad in parts. Loved the last couple of scenes especially. It's unusual to be able to watch 2 excellent films in 1 week (Joker being the other)."
1200,"This movie is visually stunning, emotionally gut-wrenching and overall the most epic conclusion to a franchise ever! Even though the movie has a 3-hour runtime it never has a minute to break. The characters development throughout the movie is perfectly written, and the plot is interessting and twisting from the start. Endgame is a new milestone in movie-making and Will stand the test of time! The MCU's epic finale has it all"
1201,Well worth the year long wait best film from the mcu
1202,"This movie was truly made for the hardcore fans of the MCU, it was filled with action and comedy, it was truly something special. In this new film we get to see these characters that we've known for over 10 years, we get to see it all come to an end. This is the perfect movie to end THE INFINITY SAGA. I cried a lot, some where tears of joy, and others where tears of sorrow. But all together this movie was spectacularly amazing. Definitely one of my favourite movies of all time."
1203,"The Russo brothers use the Infinity War-created hype to deliver a bad, lazy, pockmarked, and contradictory script to the pillars they themselves had built at the beginning of this adventure."
1204,Conflict of powerhouses. As good as Infinity Wars.
1205,This movie was a fan film for the ages. The film followed the comic book in certain scenes but it was an amazing film.
1206,Avengers: Endgame was the first movie in a long time that I walked out of with a smile on my face.[換行字元][換行字元]A perfect finale to 10 years of Marvel movies.
1207,"Perfect summation of the 21 film build-up, any marvel/superhero film fan will love it, cannot wait to buy the Blu-ray and watch special features, extras, etc."
1208,All I'm gonna say is it's annoying I can't rate this 11 on IMDb
1209,"It's been a week since Avengers : EndGame hit movie theatres. Since then, I've been trying to wrap my mind around the idea that it is really over.. This week saw EndGame breaking long-held records and creating new ones. It has made 1 billion and over $900 million worldwide! Almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been already said. Like so many others; nevertheless, I was and am profoundly emotional. I've always studied catharsis yet for the first time, I lived it. EndGame showed me the true meaning of catharsis; it purged me. It was beyond what I expected and I expected phenomenal! It was an experience like no other, a masterpiece. I laughed, cried, cheered and cried some more.. I was a complete emotional wreck towards the end. I was a ten-year old boy again. It took me to a journey which I've been part of. I was nostalgic. I saw myself in every piece of it. The movie was a capsule of memories.. This is history, the world came together to witness an end of an Era. All shapes, ages, sizes, colors, religions and genders. It was a national event! Marvel showed us how movies should be made. I've loved Lord of the Rings, I've loved Harry Potter, I've loved Star Wars. But I have LIVED the MCU. We can never be thankful enough for what you've given us. From a small kid who watched Iron-Man in 2008 with zero expectations to the man who watched EndGame three times after a week of its premiere! It was not easy for Marvel to start the MCU. Marvel had to sell some of their rights to other studios in hope to start the MCU. Things didn't go quite as planned. Therefore, Marvel gambled its rights to all of their characters to get a loan of $500 million to start the #MCU. It was a risk worth taking. A well-earned success; not only for Marvel but also for the fans, myself included. From the bottom of my heart, thank you Marvel, thank you StanLee, Russo brothers, Kevin Fiege, writers, producers and actors. Thank you, Robert Downey Jr. the one who started the game and the one who finished it. He created one hell of a legacy. I never want it to end, but ""Part of the journey is the end."" I am really grateful for being part of that journey. I love you 3000"
1210,"Avengers: Endgame is undoubtedly the most anticipated film any Marvel Fan was eager to watch. This end not only made new made more number of Marvel Fans but also raised the expectation of existing Fans. Really,the best and the great movies in history of MCU. What an epic conclusion to the culmination of 22 Movies..I laughed, enjoyed and cried because at points it was too emotional and just WOW!! What a fantastic ending..Superb!!!!!!! It feels sad that after this we are not going to see all the characters which started it. But everything had a end and it couldn't get better end than this!!!"
1211,"Endgame really is the perfect ending, it gives the fans exactly what they want from the movie."
1212,"End game, I am now a better person because of end game. They taught me courage, discipline, perseverance and sacrifice. 11 year in the making, individual character build up and many more elements proves that this should be the highest rated movie ever."
1213,"Thank you avengers,Specially Iron Man who taught us patience and fight 😭😭😭😭😭😭 #foreverfirday"
1214,"Wow. That was 3 hours? It flew. Great storytelling, great acting, great action. Nothing more to say."
1215,Best movie ever if you haven't seen it you must go see it specially if your a fan i enjoyed every second of it 😊👍
1216,"Incredible culmination of the MCU with great acting, a compelling story and satisfying ending, epic action scenes, emotional moments and memorable fan service. Considering the ambitious task that this film was, there will always be some minor things to nitpick but the Russo's have pulled off something unbelievable in the last 2 years."
1217,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. Not only the plot but also SFX are the best I've ever seen! Definitely worth the hype, I look forward to seeing this again."
1218,"WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THE RUSSO BROTHERS,,,,, After you did a terrible job of messing up the hulk in infinity war you then made it worst in endgame with nonsense professor hulk and to add insult to injury you also mess up thor,,,, you suck Russo Brothers,,,, you did such a fantastic job with the winter soldier and civil war two of my favorite movies,, what went wrong with endgame,,,,, you took two of the strongest and best avengers and turn one into a big slob and turn hulk into a big stupid teddy bear,,,,, seriously disappointed."
1219,If you say it's boring then it means that you don't understand the marvel story.It is 3 hours but it feel like 1 hour if you understand the concept.Of you say dark Phoenix means you like Xmen than the marvel phase 4
1220,"So i got the chance to see this movie earlier today in Warsaw,Poland. Now I know my title might be arguable to most people but for me and alot of the fans who have been invested in this for the last 10 years, this is no understating the fact that it is the best comicbook/superhero event ever! And possibly for a long long time we won't be seeing anything close to this.[換行字元][換行字元]I won't say anything about the movie because i dont want to spoil the Endgame for you![換行字元][換行字元]This movie is everything and beyond what we could have expected it to be! it does more than that and it has that satisfying end we all wanted![換行字元][換行字元]I write this review today as a proud and emotional fan who is satisfied to see these 10-11 years being paid off!"
1221,"There were many theories of how the remaining Avengers will reverse Thanos's snap. But I am pretty sure no one has predicted this is how the endgame would be. It is funny and emotional. This movie is one of a kind just like LOTR, Harry Potter etc. The first phase of the 180 minute long movie is slow and funny and the second phase is fast and funny with a well emotional climax for this long saga. The final battle of Endgame maybe the best battle scenes in cinematic history. The humongous cast did a well job as always and the cinematography is also perfect. Endgame was an once in a lifetime experience to me as I have watched all the 22 films over 11 years. The Avengers will continue, but it will be very hard to put something like these 3 Phases."
1222,"If my friends want me to tell about this movie. I am gonna trhow'em with the strombreaker #DontSpoilTheEndgame. But if they ask how many tears that have fallen to the floor of the cinema, its 14,000,605 teardrops."
1223,"There will be a lot of people gushing on here about this movie. Make no mistake, it was good, just not great. 21 films leading up to this point have built the tension, and what should have been a sonic boom was closer to a car backfiring. At three hours, this is a long movie. While there are moments of great humor and great sadness and great happiness, it also dragged in spots. One would expect it to be 95% action, but they spent a lot of time on fluff. Again, do not misunderstand me. I liked this movie quite a bit, but I wanted to love it, and sadly I didn't."
1224,"Just when you thought they may not live up to the hype, Just when you thought they have already done it all and there's nothing else that's gonna surprise you, Marvel does it again. Absolutely the best superhero movie ever!"
1225,"Avengers: Endgame isn't like any other movie. Actually, I would go as far as to say that it isn't a movie at all. It looks like one, it acts like one, and it's a damn good one, but Endgame feels more akin to a climactic sporting event. It's the Superbowl of the MCU, and the fact that it was marketed using highlights from previous films reinforces that thought."
1226,"With 22 films and over a decade of storytelling coming to a close, Avengers Endgame had a lot to live up to, and despite some logic gaps and a handful of plot holes, it succeeded in the most important thing it needed to do, wrapping up a story that fans who spent all this time with these characters could be satisfied with. Last years Infinity War left these superheroes at their lowest point, defeated, and struggling to cope in the wake of the Mad Titan's victory. Because of our obsession with internet news and the constant need to be informed, those fallen heroes fates were never really in question, knowing full well another Spiderman movie was on its way, with both the Guardians of the Galaxy and Black Panther having new movies in development. That left Endgame with not the if, but the how it was going to save these characters. What followed was a three hour mega opus that dwarfs even the biggest of comic book movies. Avengers Endgame is at times hilarious, and others heartbreaking, with returning directors Joe and Anthony Russo guiding the film with equal parts fun and heart, culminating in a poetic end to this sprawling storyline. It is the ultimate experience of pure fan service, awarding those who have been along for the ride with numerous callbacks to previous moments and wrapping it all up with the most expansive comic book battle ever put on film. To watch that final act without anything but a smile on your face or a tear in your eye makes me wonder why you went to the theater in the first place. Endgame was made for the fans and to criticize it for anything other than a fun time at the movies is missing the whole point. Are there plot holes? Sure, with any time travel plot it is bound to happen, but time travel isn't real, so pretending there are rules because you learned them in Back to the Future doesn't really make a lot of sense. Endgame delivers on everything it set out to do, wrapping this chapter of the MCU up in the most meaningful of ways. Maybe it doesn't take the risks that Infinity War or The Winter Soldier took, but it will be remembered for the experience that it was, and for this comic book movie fan, that is all I wanted from it."
1227,The best film .... No more words.................................................................................................................
1228,"While I am sad to see the Avengers saga end, Endgame was a great way to have it go out with a BANG! From beginning to end it was an amazing movie that you could even tell it was 3hrs long because it was fast paced! It was sad but hilarious in parts! Too bad it has to end but like I said what a way to end it all! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!"
1229,"A love letter to everything the MCU has built since 2008. Thanks Kevin Feige, Thanks Joe and Anthony Russo !!"
1230,"Other than time traveling, everything else was reasonably good. Time traveling can never give clear answers, but only make more questions."
1231,This movie is very boring for at least the first hour and forty five minutes
1232,"Best of what anyone would just imagine, best everything totally loved this movie enjoyed every single second of movie"
1233,"A few words couldn't describe the whole feeling of watching this movie ! You will laugh, yell, applaud and cry. A few powerful dialogues which got me are these : Thanos : I'm inevitable ! Tony : I'm Iron Man ! . What does it feel like ? Like it's someone else's ! . What will you do? I'm not sure, infact for the first time in 1000 years I have no path ! . So deep ! 👌 I love you 3000 💔🖤"
1234,"Avengers Endgame Review Score - 10/10 Avengers Endgame could be well described as the most complicated storyline in the entire Marvel history not only because it had to wrap up a story of eleven years but also because of the complex solution to an inevitable situation that The Avengers try to achieve with the avenging not being the major part of the story. The three hour runtime was well utilized by giving more time to establish the characters' humanistic attachments and the losses they suffered; not only in this movie, but from the very moment they've been incepted into this franchise. Unlike the previous outings, the characters differ in their choices and these contrasts in their choices lead up to one massive and satisfying final battle which may not end the entire MCU, but certainly does end a glorious era of the long franchise. The entire movie, especially the final battle was a huge fan service as it included everything a Marvel fan could possibly dream of. PS: There is no Post - Credits Scene in the film, but it is worth waiting for the entire credits to roll."
1235,Could have been an hour and a half and twice the movie.
1236,There is nothing more one can ask for. No need for hesitating even for a second about spending any amount of money for this movie.
1237,"In 2008 Iron Man hit theaters marking the birth of the MCU in the post credit scene with the line ""I here to talk to you about the Avengers initiative"". 11 years later we got Avengers Endgame the culmination of 21 movies spanning over a decade. Endgame first of all wouldn't be as appealing to a person who is watching t for the first time or has not been following comics. The movie is packed with action and drama. It was the best way to end. I don't think that the new avengers will be able to live up to the hype.Chris Evans and Robert Downy Jr had deep rooted sentiments with the audience. It will be interesting to see how MCU goes from here onward."
1238,An experience you'll gonna remember forever and watch again and again.
1239,"We have laughed, cried and rejoiced during the whole journey of 22 movies and have lived through them. It have now become a part of us and I just hope that our future generations can understand and feel the things which we understood at times and felt !!![換行字元][換行字元]Here's to Us who witness the end of an ERA !!!"
1240,"Thoroughly enjoyed a way throw and builds with great momentum, not only is this an action movie so much emotion that slowly builds, I loved the development & build up leading to its finale conclusion, this is what visiting cinema is all about and leaving on a high.[換行字元][換行字元]This is more then a part 2 of End Game but very much it's own movie that leads to its bitter sweet ending.[換行字元][換行字元]Director brothers who decided less advertising / marketing prove this is vital to ensure been moments / scenes are left for the audience to discover as it unravels on the big s screen, well done guys!"
1241,"Thank you Marvel, End Game is an ending that give me speechless."
1242,"It's a ultimate result of mcu's 10 year journey of phrase 3... And It's bang. Awesome cinematograph, screenplay,every character got enough time.... And heart touching"
1243,"Every character at least had time to shine in this movie. The story structure was easy to follow in a 3 hour movie, and the special effects we're indeed groundbreaking as usual. It's a very satisfying conclusion for the main character, and the story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
1244,We were waiting for many years. It's totally worth it. This was the best marvel movie I was waiting for..
1245,"First 2 hours are kind of dull. I was expecting more frankly. Reckon it's predictable as well, the last hour was entertaining though."
1246,"Don't waste your time, it's incredibly bad, 3 hours you will never get back."
1247,"This gives you a wow factor after 1.6 Billion worldwide is not going to stop Endgame to make a history. I don't know what will be the next Phase but for now GOTG vol.3,DoctorStrange 2,BlackWidow,The Masters of Kum-Fu,Nora is confirmed for Phase 4"
1248,This movie was just perfect. dont listen the others because they're angry that this movie has a high rating on imdb and high score on rotten tomatoes
1249,"I thought this is the kind of movie that we forget real soon even if we burst into tears while watching it. I thought this is a movie based on comics without so much great meanings. I was 100 percent wrong. Every character, every person is something. It was a story since 2008 and it has been told for 11 years. I didn't expect it to end now but now that I've watched it, every second of the movie is worth it. It is in the form of a story, but it is real. In some universe, this is happening and that universe is living prosper with a happy ending. Or, did it really end?"
1250,"Marvelous movie, touches the heart and makes you wish that it never end."
1251,"When Brie Larson arrived on Earth at the end of Captain Marvel she found the remains of Nick Fury's Avengers, the survivors of Josh Brolin's Thanos and his Infinity Stones grab. In Marvel Avengers: Endgame the Russo Brothers must band together this smaller group of superheroes to find Thanos, retrieve the Infinity Stones, and bring back their fallen comrades. The stones must then be returned to their original time in the past. Easy we might imagine in a film with a 181 minutes running time. I saw it opening day but you won't notice the length as it moves at warp speed.[換行字元][換行字元]We can see who survived Infinity War from the poster, and thanks to Captain Marvel she brings Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark back to Earth after his fight with Thanos, with Karen Gillan's Nebula and Bradley Cooper's Rocket, into Gwyneth Paltrow's waiting arms. But there's no time to reminisce as Nebula knows where her father was going after Infinity War. But having achieved his aim Thanos destroyed all the stones.[換行字元][換行字元]And with no way to bring back the 50% of the population destroyed, five years later our superheroes have found either domestic bliss, as in Pepper and Tony, Chris Evans's Steve Rogers is running grief counselling sessions, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow and Don Cheadle's War Machine are running the depleted office and well Hawkeye is really really angry about losing all his family and in Japan taking out gangsters. Jeremy Renner never got an answer to his mustard or mayonnaise question.[換行字元][換行字元]Then one day an inquisitive rat presses a button in an old van and we get Paul Rudd's Ant-Man back. And he's a little surprised as to what the hell happened in the last 5 hours he spent inside the quantum realm. And given that time is altered in the quantum realm, maybe our superheroes could travel back to collect all the stones and click their own fingers to bring everyone back. But Tony Stark isn't interested, he has his own family and doesn't want to change time. So maybe another brain might be able to create the quantum tunnel. A really big brain. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk has embraced his green side and is happy to take selfies with kids. And while I read of the year long training and diet that Scarlett Johansson followed for the back-to-back filming of both Infinity War and Endgame, well Chris Hemsworth's Thor has really let it all hang out. He got it easy this year. Nice to see Taika Waititi back as Korg. But having already done his bit with Thanos, Thor is quite happy drinking in the Asgardians' new homeland.[換行字元][換行字元]And yet Tony Stark cannot quite stop thinking about a trip Back to the Future. And is even more amazed when his testing actually proves it is possible.[換行字元][換行字元]So that's six stones to find; Time, Mind, Space, Reality, Power and Soul, and only one chance for each of the remaining Avengers to find them, and return, with their limited vials of Hank Pym's serum. Not everyone will survive as they split up to find the stones. But what great stories they'll have to tell about their adventures in the past. Although someone has discovered what our superheroes are up to. And he's coming.[換行字元][換行字元]I've been following the Marvel Avengers films, and the Marvel Agents of Shield tv series for a long time now, and Endgame is a fitting climax. Cramming everyone from Marvel into the story line was no mean feat for the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, but I think everyone made it, even with the blink and you maybe miss them scenes. But the You and Whose Army was mind blowing. Could Captain Marvel have done it all herself I wondered, maybe, but where's the fun in that, anyway she cannot turn back time, and the Avengers have always been a team. Even when they fell out and had civil wars.[換行字元][換行字元]With a rumoured budget of $400million the film was a hit the first weekend. Great fun and if you didn't enjoy it you don't have a pulse. Was it the final scene for Stan Lee though?"
1252,Movie was like awesome ....epic .... Never had to end this way but thriller!!!
1253,"The story-telling is so powerful that you hardly find a minute in 3hr joyless.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is so well written and directed that no matter, which character you like the most, you would find a moment of ecstasy. (Though, one particular character should have given more importance I think. You will find out!)[換行字元][換行字元]DO NOT watch the HD-cam print from torrents. It will be a big mistake not to watch this movie in 3D."
1254,"It may have just been the high expectations set by the reviews, but this movie is not as good as the internet is making it out to be. Infinity War, in my opinion, was a much much stronger film overall. This was very poorly paced, had some really bad attempts of humour, and a lot of unnecessary scenes. The actual plot was quite good and kept me engaged, but the execution was lacking. Don't go into the cinema with high expectations because you may be disappointed."
1255,Avengers endgame is so much i expected and yet more Its surprises everyone. Even after spoilers its worth watching. This grand ending of a marvel era mesmerizes everyone.
1256,"I always pity releases on same weekends with the Avengers franchise still playing.What does this release has for fans especially you reading this review?My response is simply. It has everything you need in a single motion.From casting to directing.With great characters coordination,an exemplary to the saying that biggest stars shine brighest before they die.Screenplay and dialogue great,setting and cinematography excellent,costume and editing faultless. The dark side has to do with acting,at particular point in time,one could see hyper-performances where it was not neccessary.Great movie,spotless in all dimensions of movie making"
1257,"Actually, no words can describe this movie... Better watch it yourself"
1258,I was never so thoroughly entertained by any movie or story before as I have been by Infinity War and Endgame. I was on the edge of my seat for every viewing and don't believe any movie cliffhanger could ever be better than this pair. MARVEL is my goto. Thanks for this!! ❤❤❤❤❤
1259,This is truly history in the making. I am very proud to be a part of it. The acing was superb. The graphics were colorful. The action was over-packed with awesomeness and the story-line is definitely the best there is. I am hoping to see this movie to win at least one Academy Award. Thank you Russo Brothers for giving us this spectacular moment and of course thank you Stan Lee for once again sharing yor outstanding creation with the world.
1260,"Seeing a movie like this was an awesome experience. Avengers: Endgame, had all, comic moments, dramatic moments, painful moments, battle, personification of love for humanity, heroism and finally JUSTICE and happy ending. This film was the end of a glorious era in world cinematography."
1261,"I was watched this movie. But, i didn't move on. This movie was very-very amazing and epic."
1262,Honestly I don't know what I wasn't expecting but it certainly wasn't this. This movie is absolutely phenomenal it has the perfect balance of emotions and action.
1263,"Didn't meet expectations which were pretty high to begin with after infinity war. As others have mentioned, too many plot holes, too many characters, just did not work for me. Captain Marvel was made to look uninspiring, and was grossly under utilized.the Abengers franchise lost it's charm."
1264,"Real shame this movie didn't stick the landing as I'm a big fan. Enjoyed the first 20 minutes or so but after that the movie can't decide on a tone, many of the jokes fall completely flat and many character decisions are made purely for fan service instead of servicing the story. By the end I was left with a movie confused about its identity."
1265,"Endgame is a movie surrounded with mountains of hype, but it lives up to it in ways you wouldn't expect. I will not say it is the most action packed film out there, nor was it destined to be, but it is surely the most emotional Marvel movie created.[換行字元][換行字元]Plot- If you have seen Infinity War, you know that whatever the plot may be is almost a surprise. The writers could have made it easier on the Avengers, but they didn't, thus resulting in a highly entertaining experience in which you must accept the fact that the solution is mostly unbelievable. But this is a Marvel movie we are speaking of. Any realistic criticism should be set aside for movies based on reality.[換行字元][換行字元]Writing- Marvel got it down beautifully. The way they portray characters in a new light, the way they nail those corny one-liners, the way they interlock the storylines is so amazing yet nothing far from simplistic. They didnt have to go far, they just needed a duration in which they could fulfill each characters destiny. And it is not a rushed process; there is a reason this film is 3 hours.[換行字元][換行字元]Plot- This movie takes on a plot nobody expected. When it displayed a time lapse, I was shocked yet thrilled. There is a reason they didn't spoil much in the trailer.[換行字元][換行字元]Characters- Nobody is cut short here. Although it is a long film, not one important character is left shorthanded. Maybe some are, but if so, they are left totally open eneded for another film. I cannot spoil this but I will say a major Marvel hero will definitely make another appearance in the upcoming film in phase 5. We obviously know about Guardians 3 and Spiderman: Homecoming, so I will not reveal who will be most prevalent.[換行字元][換行字元]Writing- The writing is downright awesome, probably some of the best that they've done. We have characters that bend out of form, hilarity that actuallly has perfect timing, as well as emotion unlike no other Marvel film. For me, ""Logan"" had alot of emotional weight, and this was similar, although they pertain to alternating Marvel Universes. The humour is on point. Never a missed beat.[換行字元][換行字元]Characters/Acting- For me, I always think about the contrast between actor and character. I feel like, just as most Marvel movies containing the same characters, that they were uber successful. You feel for these characters- maybe not as much as you would observing them from the start, but they are true to form. Who else would have played these mighty beings?[換行字元][換行字元]Quality- Endgame is no joke. It's not a cash-in kind of buy, these people knew what their fans deserved. The editing is prime, the filming is loose yet focused, the sound is perfect, the animation is mind blowing- observe how they make Michael Douglas appear 40 years younger- and the sequencing is phenomenal.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall. Endgame does what most logical people want, as well as what most kids don't expect- emotional justification. It's reality. It takes about an hour or so to truly kick in the full-on action, but when you're a fan of the series, you truly understand. It's more about the intensity. The action is delivered at a high caliber, but this story is primarily about the power struggle between humanity and the unknown. Truly amazing."
1266,Just want to thanks Stan lee Jack Kirby and Jim Starlin for creating these characters and thanks to Russo brothers for bringing them on to screen in the best way
1267,"Three hours of great quality film, the best film of Marvel, let's see if the Next phase can beat the last one"
1268,"Up till this morning Avengers Infinity War was my favorite of the MCU films. Avengers Endgame is now my favorite and not just MCU, but all time. Greatest story ever told in films. PHENOMENAL"
1269,"I thought that Endgame will blow me away, I was wrong. Infinity Ward was an amazing movie, it got 10 out off stars and it just a flawless masterpiece with no errors just pure art. Endgame is full off meaningless crap like the awful humor with cheesy one liners that just destroys the entire movie. It's not funny please stop it I thought while the movie just keep going with these lame and embarrassing jokes that just bored and got me mad at the movie to the point that I wanted it to end but it never did. Another bad thing is that Endgame is so predictable that its just a joke, you don't even have to watch the movie to know how it ends. But the movie did entertain me and it really got tearing up scenes that left me emotional and great character ark, acting and action scenes, but the problem is that there isn't enough of these elements to save the movie, and what's left is a big letdown. Good dammit."
1270,It was brilliant movie to watch. The movie itself was a roller coaster of emotions. It brought me up and down and trashed me at the end. It was one of a kind experience. I recommend everyone to watch this movie.
1271,"2 things: 1. Can someone tell me what happen to Thor's hammer? Capt. America left with Thor's hammer & returned with his own shield. What the heck did he do with the hammer? 2. Did no one notice Thor's beard. OMG, it changed so much from scene to scene...it's ridiculous. Not only the style but the color! I lost count how many times it changed."
1272,"After the sorta disappointing(but not terrible) Captain Marvel, i had some minor concerns to what would happen but all of them were subverted, amazing action, acting, cgi, a complex but kinda simple story to follow, and plenty of easter eggs for those who watch many of the previous films are gonna have an orgasm watching this.[換行字元][換行字元]Conclusion: go see it!!!!!"
1273,It is getting very boring now. not realistic at all
1274,"After watching Infinity War I couldn't wait for Endgame to come out and I wasn't disappointed at all.[換行字元][換行字元]There were so many emotions packed into a 3 hour film, which I didn't think was too long, for everyone who loves these films and wanted a conclusive end they loved this film.[換行字元][換行字元]there were so many badass moments and Marvel seemed to let the Russo brothers do what they wanted to film it in their image. There were upsetting moments and heart warming moments that you couldn't help but love it.[換行字元][換行字元]They also put in a lot of moments that linked back to older films which was great and they also managed to have one of the best action scenes I've seen in a while. And finally for those that have seen it that moment during the battle that linked to the comic books was so awesome and everyone in the cinema was screaming, cheering and clapping, it was a very interactive room of people for a film which was very nice for a change."
1275,"My spoiler free review of Avengers Endgame:[換行字元][換行字元]The best MCU movie. The theatre I was in went totally nuts. It had spectacular action, it was surprisingly funny, and emotionally captivating. It manages a large roster of well developed characters which are very well executed, everyone gets a moment to shine. Delightful throwbacks to previous outings as well as smartly placed pop culture references. A truly satisfying finale for the 22movie and 11 year story arc which we have come to love."
1276,"Worth going to see in the cinema, incredible!! Cinematography was perfect and the final battle scene was everything I hoped for, fan moment after fan moment after fan moment!!!"
1277,"This movie was surprisingly boring for the first two hours. Too much talking, tears and drama. The boredom of the drama and the action starts exactly after two hours. I started enjoying this movie only at that point. During the two hours of drama I was constantly thinking whether I should leave, but 12 Euros that I paid made me wait. Being fun of the genre, for me this was not impressible at all. Waste of money and time."
1278,"Avengers: Endgame (2019, Russo Brothers)[換行字元][換行字元]So the culmination of eleven years worth of set up in this Marvel Cinematic Universe that feels like an episodic tv series is about to have its finale and its a big one... over three hours. This film is sure to satisfy those who have been impressed with the last couple of phases of Marvel films, I personally gravitate towards the Phase One films. This direct sequel to last years Infinity War starts off quite slow for the first hour or so and I think this will be the main complaint by most people but I did not mind the low key hangs with these surviving characters. The film does pick up though and has a few laughs along the way, some above average action, fun hijinx but the whole time I am thinking this story is wasted on these terrible visual directors. Marvel films are all pretty bland but the Russos make spectacle so damn ugly. That said most of the conclusions are satisfying from a story point of view bar some small missteps here and there."
1279,"Basically the title. Left me speechless. I was probably too hyped to the point of annoyance but it broke my massive expectations to the point that I'm watching it again 2 more times this weekend. It leaves you at the edge of your seat and the 3rd act is just insane and a masterpiece. Infinity War was fantastic but this is insanity, in all the right ways. The best series finale that I hoped it would be and then some."
1280,"I have never applauded during a premiere night, now I did, thank you MCU!"
1281,"Avengers: Endgame, the culmination of eleven years of storytelling spanning twenty-two movies, represents a very peculiar time in the history of film. It is at once an incredibly ambitious project and the product of twenty-two mostly reasonable, inoffensive films made to appeal to the broadest audience possible. It is a celebration of something I'm not sure should be celebrated, the concentration of the box office and blockbuster culture at the expense of artistry, done so by an aggressive corporation that conquers more and more of Hollywood's creative landscape each day.[換行字元][換行字元]And it's absolutely magnificent.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is the sequel to last year's Infinity War, an average movie elevated by a truly shocking ending. For the first time, we went into our twice-a-year dose of Marvel movie expecting the expected victory and were greeted with bitter defeat. Our heroes had been tossed aside, their ideals shattered and in many cases lives ended, all to give this purple raisin man a happy ending complete with a farm and an infuriating little grin. It was incredible because it was unexpected, and unexpected not because it wasn't a possibility, but within the Marvel Cinematic Universe the concept of the unexpected seemed as foreign to their writers as original storytelling.[換行字元][換行字元]To say I dislike the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be an overstatement. I have seen all twenty-two of its installments, and while liking only a few of them, there have been fewer still that I've actively disliked. For the most part, they've been perfectly reasonable ways to spend a couple hours on a Saturday afternoon, undercut by low stakes and the inevitable joke that follows every dramatic moment.[換行字元][換行字元]But although Endgame is a part of this franchise, its storytelling feels decidedly different. Where the MCU is comical, Endgame is dramatic. Where the MCU is superficial, Endgame is expansive and thorough. Where the MCU is formulaic, Endgame is unpredictable. Where the MCU is cynical, Endgame is emotional. And where the MCU is always building to a conclusion that it seems will never come, Endgame is that conclusion. Of course, this isn't to say it doesn't retain some elements of what's made the MCU so popular. The humour and characterization are there, though a little less fleshed out than in previous installments.[換行字元][換行字元]This relative lack of characterization and humour makes sense given the context of the film. We've already seen twenty other films, which served not only the purpose of building to where we are now but familiarizing us with the characters that populate this story. Understanding it felt rewarding, as if I'd studied for the last ten years and proceeded to do well on the exam, a feeling I'm hardly familiar with. And what characterization there is is generally well thought out, even if the dialogue lacks the snappiness of Whedon's takes on the franchise.[換行字元][換行字元]But what the film does have is power. Emotional moments take center stage, with more a scene than not delivering a tear-inducing moment, doubtlessly rendering the invested viewer an emotional wreck by the time the credits roll. The Russos very clearly understand that they're delivering the final adventure - at least of this particular saga - and imbue their film with powerful nostalgia enhanced by melancholy and exhilaration in equal measure.[換行字元][換行字元]This isn't to say Endgame is a masterpiece. The story's logic often threatens to cave down on itself and the film as a whole is somewhat short on action. Thor's arc isn't handled nearly as gracefully as the others, which is a shame because he became one of the more interesting Avengers after Ragnarok and arguably the most after Infinity War. The pacing of individual scenes occasionally feels unnecessarily drawn out, usually to service a limp punch-line that reduces whatever emotion the respective scene was striving towards. The second act feels underdeveloped compared to the first and the third, offering an interesting concept while failing to exploit its thematic potential. But there are moments when all the pieces come together, delivering something it seems only this film can, a soaring, kinetic, exhilarating joy that had my audience applauding and me wanting to. And it's moments like these when Endgame is untouchable.[換行字元][換行字元]How the hell they follow this up is a question for a new era of actors, storytellers, and the corporation that towers over them all. But I'm going to bet that they don't.[換行字元][換行字元]As for me, I think I'm finished with superhero movies. That being said, they've been putting smiles on my face and tears in my eyes for almost my entire life, and for that I'm grateful."
1282,Go see now it's by far the best superhero movie ever made hands down.
1283,"Whilst the visual effects are the highlight, this film did not delight or live up to the fantastic setup from Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]The pace is off, the characters are painfully not funny or behave in ways which have been set out in the previous 21 movies.[換行字元][換行字元]I have enjoyed TV series finales more than this. It was a huge undertaking to get to this point and generally the previous films were good, this for missed the mark.[換行字元][換行字元]In Infinity War when Spiderman met his demise - that was a touching moment, this film cannot recreate that at all, I found the emotional scenes more amusing than sad or emotive.[換行字元][換行字元]I do not want to write spoilers for the movie so that is all I can say but this for me was the worst MCU movie to date."
1284,Just oh my God. I wasnt ready for this. Every Mcu fan will love that movie
1285,"It's absolutely the best movie in the world . I laughed, cried again and again my emotions were changing in every scene , CGI: perfect , ACTING: perfect STORY WRITING: perfect EVERYTHING RELATED TO IT: AMAZINGLY DONE . What ever good things i say about is movie is not enough . You have to see it to understand even a 10/10 isn't enough . 3 hrs felt like 30 mins time flew like there WAS NO TIME ;) . It has been wonderful 10 yrs . IT MAKES ME SAD THAT THIS IT , NO AVENGERS MOVIES ANYMORE . #BEST_MOVIE_EVER_MADE"
1286,"A very long movie that turns boring the first 2 hrs, and we have the same enemies and fights that we already have seen. You should save your time and your money. With stupid jokes and characters, with bad acting from almost all the actos. The only good thing is Tilda."
1287,Just Awesome!! Go watch it. This is something you have to experience for yourself.
1288,"This is average movie. I see after everyone see but during watching movie, it is average boring movie. I except lot more from this movie. Infinity movie is the best."
1289,They wanted to make a film and tell a story with CGI. They failed. Why are actors giving their faces for this? Its the only human thing left in it. Everything else is just CGI. Tells me nothing.
1290,"I have Never dreamed of a better ending for this already incredible saga, than this one. Lives up to all the hype and anticipation and finally an ending which improves its predecessors in every way! GO SEE IT!"
1291,"Lived up to expectations. Every single minute of the movie had me wondering what was going to happen next. Enough movement in the storyline that it never was boring. But I will say, bring your tissues!!"
1292,"An Incredibly Well-Made movie. You could observe the hard-work and commitment the Russo Brothers implemented on this great film. Visually stunning, compelling storyline and a prodigious amount of Role-Model heroes with captivating character growths. A balanced scale of action and drama. This was an emotional rollercoaster for me as I cried, laughed, sat at the edge of my seat and cried again. Unreal. Greatest MCU movie to have ever existed."
1293,"It's full of action, emotional and mind-blowing moments"
1294,"Thank you Russo brothers! Thank you for living up the dream of every Marvel fans! I am not sure if there will be a better movie than this in the upcoming years. But this has got to be the best superhero comic movie ever made! If you are hyped with all this reviews coming in, you have another thing coming your way. Stop whatever you are doing and do whatever it takes to the watch this epic movie of the year! A finale well written and a movie worth every penny of your money. Bring your kids, family, friends and have the best 3 hours of your life like i did. We were never ready for this. We never did.... #WhateverItTakes #Endgame"
1295,"This superhero movie does it all. It will make you laugh, cry and go beaming with excitement. This movie met everybody's expectations ; might I say even exceeded them, and won our hearts and entertained us yet again on the largest scale possible.[換行字元][換行字元]Although some may find the first half of the movie a bit slow and long (but definitely not boring) , it is essential as it covers a lot of ground , and is nevertheless fun to watch and ultimately leads us to what will be known forever as the MOTHER OF ALL CLIMAXES."
1296,"Phenomenal and mind blowing!!!!!! 22 movies interwoven together is an amazing, unparalleled feat. Avengers: Endgame is the crown jewel of the Infinity Saga and a worthy ending of the first 3 phases of the MCU."
1297,"I remember when HULK movie came with Eric Bana featuring and after Edward Norton came as a HULK replacing him, after seeing those movies there was nothing on my mind a bunch of superheroes and villains will appear along with HULK. Not to mention The Fantastic Four. When I saw those movies i am very much satisfied not very too much of people gathering around for one cause and will be fighting for it. Separate character in a individual timeline satisfied me in all way. When Iron Man movie released , hey there comes an another guy.. and i seriously swear i thought this will be like previous movies. Instead Nick Appears in the post credit scene in the second part of Iron Man . Even Tony Stark appears in post credit scene in the Incredible hulk movie speaking to the General guy in a bar, i thought two geniuses are gonna do something, but that was just left there and these screenwriters comes up with a gigantic story from Iron Man 2 movie they think they can handle it. did they ? or they are too amateur to handle it ! thinking of they would have taken care of in a better way instead they rushed it in a way to end it like an ending which we all seen in porn movies.[換行字元][換行字元]Expression was quite opposite way..."
1298,I loved this last installment great movie for people that haven't seen this on e your going to be thrilled about it but it will shock you as well.
1299,Where's the credit scene? There's always an end scene. I mean I know it's endgame but there's still more to it.
1300,It is dramatic perfect and entusiastic. You can feel the movie inside you and the end is perfect.
1301,"Avengers: Endgame It was probably the best movie I ever watched.[換行字元][換行字元]I laughed, cried a lot, There is no words to describe this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]It is a mix of emotions, feelings. You will cry. Laugh. Get huge goosebumps."
1302,"You will cheer. You will laugh. You will smile. You will cry.[換行字元][換行字元]This is it, the culmination of everything in the MCU up until now, and it was well worth the wait. The stakes are real, just as the Russos said, and watching the heroes that we have come to love charge once more unto the breach will have your eyes glued to the screen for every goddamn moment."
1303,It was way too long and overrated. Infinity War was a much better movie. I don't get all the hype.
1304,Well done Marvel! Can't expect more than this as end of a journey!
1305,"Despite several plot holes (and unlikable Captain Marvel), Endgame delivered an epic ending to the 3rd phase of MCU."
1306,"THE WORST !!! they turned what should have been the best comic book plot, into a bollywood melodrama, it's just pathetic. don't waste your time watching babies material."
1307,"I found that this was a perfect conclusion of some characters stories and for the most part, Phase 3"
1308,Endgame is a masterpiece of cinema. Everything i hoped for and more. Just excellence!
1309,"A culmination of 11 years of characters in one movie is hard to pull of yet pull it off well, combining incredible heart felt moments along with a surprising amount of funny ones too for a movie suffering from the dreadful consequences of the last, well worth the watch if at all a fan of marvel"
1310,"This grand finale was epic, incredible, emotional and has perfect ending for our superheroes. Worth watching twice, thrice as much as you want. Perfect timings for jokes, incredible action and a fruitful experience. Will go down as one of the best movies of all time."
1311,"May contain mild spoilers I'm giving this movie a 9/10 because THERE are better marvel movies as a whole, winter solider, civil war, infinity war, BUT, I just feel it caps off the 11 year stint to perfection, the 3 vs 1 battle is brilliant and everything Iv wanted to see being a huge captain America fan, there are some silly moments, some funny moments and plenty of emotional moments and as usual the CGI is completely spot on personally I don't think I could of ended any better, congratulations Russo brothers Kevin feige and cast, you gave this marvel fan the ending he wanted"
1312,Best movie ever Bester saga ever I love it Ein episches Erlebnis was. Unvergesslichen ist Ich hoffe es geht viele. Jahre so. Weiter[換行字元][換行字元]Danke vielen Dank
1313,"I couldn't have hoped for it to be as satisfying as it is. After 11 years, the Infinity Saga closes with the ultimate showdown that the MCU could have provided. I'm honestly not sure how they can top it.[換行字元][換行字元]Following the snap that concludes ""Infinity War"" with 50% of all living life in the universe extinguished, the remaining Avengers struggle to cope with their collective loss. Reunited with a couple of missing friends, the heroes come up with a daring plan, to collect the Infinity Stones before Thanos and return to their time, undoing the snap with one of their own and returning those lost.[換行字元][換行字元]""Endgame"" is perhaps, the ultimate fan servicing sequel of all time. Shorn back to (almost) only the original Avengers, the film is then like a greatest hits tour, as the time travel element allows the characters to revisit past MCU highspots from another angle. The film also includes dozens of lines of dialogue from previous films, and dozens of visual or emotional call backs and pay offs. The amount of characters it services is masterful, with each getting at least one or two strong character and action moments over the run time. (Whilst I'm on the runtime, any concerns that three hours would be a problem are forgotten as the film flies by)[換行字元][換行字元]It's not totally without flaws. It's a little laggy in its opening sections, and I'm not sure that the world following the initial time jump in entirely believable, but these are minor criticisms against a film that, with 11 years build up and 22 films back story, is more complete and rewarding than you could possibly have hoped it would be."
1314,Avtar was best in 2001-2010 Niw this is best in 2010-2020. Best Movie of decades. I got emotional at lots of moments. Noone can imagine what happened next in the movie. So wonderful 100 out of 10
1315,"Watched Endgame twice in its two days of release in India. It's an epic and emotional movie showing everything for its perfect conclusion of 11 years. Beyond expectations, this movie will amaze you in every moment. Can't say too much because as a fan, everyone has a lot to say. Love to be a Marvel fan."
1316,Ok so to start this is not a bad movie. However it's not the best of the avengers franchise. Only way I can explain it is there seems to be a lot going on without anything really happening.[換行字元][換行字元]The whole time travel thing makes no sense at all. Although they do try to explain it during the movie all I can say if the way they describe time travel to work is true then half the cast wouldn't exist.....[換行字元][換行字元]Hulk was better before he became the weird half human half green beast thing.... Thor drunk all the time not cool.[換行字元][換行字元]Think ideas for what to do with everyone ran a bit thin towards the end.[換行字元][換行字元]However there is some funny moments. Some good battles and obviously most of the characters are generally awesome.[換行字元][換行字元]Don't let anything I say put you off but don't expect it to be a good as previous movies.
1317,"This was more than what I thought it was going to be! Without giving anything away (Thanos demands your silence!), it was perfect. I laughed, I may have had some ocular leakage, I laughed more. The acting was great, it was hard to watch some of my favorite characters to seem defeated, and depressed. The ending was the best. I have seen it twice already and will probably see it a third time."
1318,"Awesome movie.. a special treat to the marvel fans by the Russo bros. really liked the movie, a must watch movie for every marvel fan out there. Its really the ENDGAME, a nice and sad ending of the infinity saga."
1319,"The best movie of the Marvel Cinematic universe.., Power packed with comedy, emotions, action.... etc. All the cast and crew are worked hard. I think everybody go and watch the movie.. Experience it in IMAX 3D"
1320,This movie has the absolute perfect balance of fan service and harsh moments. Lean into the tears and suspend a little disbelief. This movie is everything we needed and more than we deserved.
1321,"I laughed, I cried, I cheered and I said goodbye. An excellent ending to the best universe ever created!"
1322,"I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess."
1323,"Review is pasted below from my original review of my blog back in April. Link for that is below as well, it's the same review with added links and visuals/photos. Thanks :)[換行字元][換行字元]kunalatthemovies.movie.blog/2019/04/24/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review/[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers: Endgame is directed by Marvel Studio veterans, Anthony and Joe Russo. They previously directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War. (In my opinion they have directed some of the best MCU films) They are currently the only directors who have directed 4 films in the MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]I honestly do not know where to begin, because I genuinely do not want to spoil anything about this film. On Wednesday April 24th I went for an early morning 3am advanced screening in Dolby Cinema of the film so that I can go in blind and avoid any kind of spoilers, and it worked brilliantly. I will be watching the film again on Saturday April 27th in IMAX, since it is the only film to be shot entirely (3 hours and 2 minutes) with IMAX cameras. I wish for all the fans to watch the film in the same way, go in totally blind and you will not be disappointed. This film works with surprise, shock and awe. One of the only other films that left the same impression on me was The Empire Strikes Back, which I believe is a film that the Russo Brothers highly admire, I mean who doesn't.[換行字元][換行字元]Anyway, back to the MCU. I will not disclose any plot points of the film, I won't even provide any captured frames of the film/trailer. I will however talk about the aesthetics and qualities of the film. The pacing of the film fluctuates slightly, I mean it is just over three hours long, but a welcomed three hours. Some people might find it a little too long, especially the first act. The first act is definitely a slow burn, but it has to be because of what happened at the end of Infinity War. It needed to be sober and built up to the recuperation of what the heroes just went through, the heroes we have grown to love over the past decade. However the pacing picks up significantly with a surprising and perfectly enjoyable fun second act; and a climactic third act that is emotionally hard hitting. The musical score isn't groundbreaking but it does satiate the appetite of the visuals in the film. We have all heard and been pumped up by the Avengers theme, which this film uses a few times at key narrative points.[換行字元][換行字元]What I love about the filmmaking of the Russo's is their viceral style that also manages to feel grounded where the viewer feels like a part of what is happening. In all their MCU films I never felt like a man in the sky watching over what is happening on the ground with the characters. They manage to frame the action where it feels intense and emotional yet without having confused close ups or a ""shaky cam"" effect, which unfortunately many action films do nowadays. The production design and sets of Endgame are amazing, with a mix of practical effects and CG set pieces striking a perfect balance like never before in the MCU. Without giving away anything, I will say I was extremely surprised with a lot of the set pieces and ""things"" and ""stuff"" that happened. Sorry I really can't go into any more detail than that. If you are a fan and have been following the MCU films, Endgame is something you will definitely enjoy and feel satisfied about. It manages to create ""fan service"" without compromising on quality or impact, be it emotionally or narratively.[換行字元][換行字元]If you haven't watched most, if not all, of the previous 21 Marvel Studios films, then I have to say that this film will not impact you in the way that it is meant to. You cannot view Endgame as a solo self contained film. It is a culmination 3 phases and 21 films spanning 11 years. Yes each phase had an ""end,"" Phase One ended with The Avengers (2012), Phase Two ended with Avengers: Age of Ultron/Ant-Man (2015). But I would say those would be end of chapters, whereas Endgame isn't just the end of Phase Three or a chapter, it is the end of a book, the end of the Infinity Saga, honestly the end of an era.[換行字元][換行字元]The entire MCU so far has been an overall success with a few films falling short in quality, Endgame brings it all to a satisfying close. The film takes risks and does a lot of unexpected things that I feel strengthen the film as a whole. It manages to somewhat breakaway from the formulaic superhero genre and manages to try and be something different. As Endgame climaxed, so did I and I honestly cannot wait to watch Endgame again on Saturday, this time in IMAX. It's going to be a whole different experience to a film I think is near perfect.[換行字元][換行字元]Rating: I am giving Avengers: Endgame a 9 out of 10. Highly recommended to any and all Marvel fans and even the casual Marvel film goer. A gripping conclusion of a 21 film saga, I cannot wait to see what is the next step in the MCU. I am happy and thankful to Marvel Studios for making all these films and building this saga to a crescendo with Endgame. I laughed, I cried, I gasped, I was on the edge of my seat during this film. This whole three phase journey has been a wild ride, let's hope their next phases can hit the mark again and perhaps take it further. Until Spider-Man: Far From Home (which Kevin Feige has said is the actual last film of Phase Three) is released in July, Marvel Studios has said they will not officially announce anything about their future plans for the MCU. So we will have to just wait until post July 2019. However Disney finalized acquiring the rights of 21st Century Fox this year, so we can expect the X-Men and Fantastic Four to join the MCU in the near future. Also Disney+ streaming service is launching towards the end of this year so we can expect to see a lot more original content being shot and produced, from smaller budget feature films to original series based in the MCU. What can I say except 2019 is a great year for Marvel and Disney overall."
1324,"This movie had me crying, laughing, gasping and completely mesmerised from start to finish. It was worth the wait, it was full of things I did not expect and some things I did, which is good too! I honestly loved it and I'm going to go back and watch it again. YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE."
1325,A very very very good film with a very emotional ending. Film is just best film yet and is worth winning an Oscar. Marvel have out done themselves. 😱😱
1326,"Hilarious, beautiful, magnificent, melancholic, inspiring. This movie is pure art, and one of the greatest things I have experienced"
1327,"Very stupid, innocent, no depth, mediocrity, no truthBug to much"
1328,I didn't even realize three hours have passed until the movie ended. Best movie I've ever seen.
1329,Fitting end to the Avengers in an entertaining span of 23 movies. Phase 4 is the new hope of the New Avengers.
1330,The most impactful movie in the entire MCU! Going to see it again and will be just as amazing as watching it the first time. It's a tear jerker for sure but plenty of humorous scenes that don't dilute the serious ones. Thank you Marvel and Disney!
1331,"There are two types of Marvel fans: Those that are true to the cinematic universe, and those that grew up embracing the comic book universe. You'll know who's who by hearing their opinion, or reading their review. To mine, I believe there were far too many opportunities missed where this movie could've leapt to incredible heights. Unfortunately, the universe and popular comic book story lines were sacrificed to pay homage to characters who we've come to love and live with. All in all, looking forward to the next phase. But this is one film that will leave me wondering, and not completely for positive reasons, either."
1332,"I have watched and enjoyed all the movies leading up to this one, over the past decade, however I left slightly disappointed with Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]Personally, I thought it didn't live up to the hype.[換行字元][換行字元]I was particularly disappointed with Captain Marvel's screen-time, given the power she possesses."
1333,Mi first review to say that this is completele awesome. An awesome experience taken to the next level. Do yourself a favour and run to the movie theathers.
1334,Loved this film it was Brilliant and in parts Funny well worth the 3hr watch
1335,Wow! What a POS movie...So much talking. So much crying.. So much boring no action garbage. These high scores must be paid off. Don't believe the reviews. Stopped watching in one hour..and yes that first hour was painful. I can't imagine fighting thru another two hours. What a shocker. A three hour movie that stinks. Who's idea is it to make movies three hours?!?! Most of them are garbage.[換行字元][換行字元]Skip this at all costs
1336,"For a Marvel movie it was ok, better than most. However this has no place being higher ranked than Schindler's list, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Forrest Gump, Every Kubrick movie ever made and many more. People should take of their Marvel fanboy hats and stop shoving these movies to the top. I'm not saying you shouldn't enjoy them, but stop inflating the reviews just based on the fact that you grew up with the characters and judge them on the movie itself."
1337,"How did they get this so wrong?[換行字元][換行字元]Absolute travesty, and possibly the most disappointed I've ever been with a movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Lately disappointment is a recurring theme, with a string of average or outright terrible ""blockbusters""."
1338,"I am usually a really big fan of anything marvel but seriously what a crappy way to end this saga... Why did the writers need to add in all of the SJW rubbish in the movie? And what's the go with captain marvel? Terrible casting, made me dislike the movie even more... And ruining Thor? He's usually one of the most enjoyable characters to watch. And they turned him into a useless drunk. I really don't understand the high ratings.. Please don't believe the hype."
1339,"The previous Avenger movies do not have a perfect plot because of it's limited time for a long story. The endgame is long enough to enjoy the rising action and twists and everything else just for the final hit, way better than all previous movies. The reason I gave 9 stars instead of 10 is because the storyline consists of fragments which were presented not perfectly but it's good. I mean it is hard to make it perfect but your mind have to be flexible and clear enough to switch between those fragments. Overall it's worth watching it."
1340,"This felt like a wrap up.

1343,"No wods enough to describe the movie, i will watch again and again"
1344,I can't express my view.It is the best movie of my life you must go and should watch this movie it's not too late. There are many twist and turn in the movie I can't tell you just watch it
1345,"The Russo brothers' poignant, powerful finale more than lives up to the hype: It's a thrilling conclusion and a deeply emotional exploration of loss and love, duty and honor, friendship and family. Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the story focuses on the remaining Avengers and their post-trauma lives. Each seems overwhelmed by their failure, so when they start to regroup, it's clear that they're far from the same confident, optimistic superheroes who thought they could defeat Thanos in Infinity War. The dads in the group are particularly effective at showing how personal the grief is, providing a contrast to the general sense of failure and loss that the single superheroes feel. As the often underappreciated Hawkeye, Renner stands out in a crowded field of immense talent for making his character feel central. His intensity and his platonic, brotherly love for Natasha/Black Widow is perfectly conveyed. Johansson does a lot of the emotionally resonant work in the movie, keeping tabs on everyone, encouraging her friends, and acting like everyone's favorite sister (except in the Hulk's case). The big three -- Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor -- are also fabulous. Their differences have never been more obvious, but each proves that despite past conflicts and heartbreaks, they're worthy and ready to fight side by side.[換行字元][換行字元]There's so much packed into the three hours of Avengers: Endgame that it might seem overwhelming at times; this is clearly a film that will inspire repeat viewing. There are unexpected twists and moments of hilarity, as well as more serious scenes and themes. Those well-versed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will delight in the many Easter eggs and clear fan service (yes, there's still a Stan Lee cameo), while more casual fans will still find plenty of reasons to applaud. What's also true is that the three-hour movie brings all the feels. Just when one gut-punching beat finishes, there's barely enough of a break for a zinger from Tony or Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) before another ""oh no"" moment squeezes your heart. But don't despair: This is a bittersweet example that the best heroes won't allow hubris or insecurity to defeat them. Endgame ranks up there with The Return of the King and Deathly Hallows: Part 2 -- all are epic, emotional, and exceptional franchise finales."
1346,From beginning to end leaves you on the edge of your seat what a movie this is truly a masterpiece
1347,"This is a historical moment for Marvel and the people working with MSU and its especially great for all the fans around the world. This movie gave me goosebumps, made me cry, scared me and not all movie can do those different things so I definitely think that this move deserves 10 stars"
1348,"A disjointed CGI mess. Too much going on to feel like a real narrative was going on. Very few laughs, didn't feel like it had much of a soul. Thought infinity war was a much more complete marvel movie."
1349,"This movie can actually be named as ""best movie ever"". MCU has started 11 years ago, and every movie they did before, all this work was wasted for this incredible moment - finish a work they have been done. Every ppl have to watch it, cause anyone can just try, to describe that fantastic movie."
1350,"If you're a Marvel fan, this movie literally has everything. Nothing is left out. No stone unturned and all are cared for with incredible deftness. To weave together 21 movies into one HUGE and epic finale, while very properly tying up loose ends, is just beyond impressive. The cheers, the sacrifices, the resolutions, all are so very well done for this type of genre. This movie entertains on a scale that ""hitherto"" has never been seen. Lol. No other movie franchise has come close to matching the MCU magic, and none ever will. This was very special and a masterful piece of comic book action movie making."
1351,One of the most emotional roller coasters! So funny yet so sad truly brought an end to the first decade of the MCU
1352,This movie is simply art. The whole movie let you on the edge of you seat and it doesn't feel like 3hours at all.
1353,Amazing & shocking. I'm so proud with Russo's jobs
1354,Chop this movie in half and it would be a solid 8. This version of the Avengers is painfully long; it would be a thriller like the last installment if it was way shorter.

This movie is dramatic, it's emotional, it's hilarious, it's fun, it has great action, it's pretty much everything that you'd want out of one of these movies. I think I like Infinity War a little more, but this movie is a close second! That's pretty much all I can say without spoiling anything. This movie has many surprises and I don't want to give any of them away, so just go see it if you are even a little bit of a Marvel fan. As I've stated before, I'm not a big Marvel fan but I really connected with this movie in a pretty meaningful way. This is the film event of this generation. Don't miss it!"
1358,"The Russo Brothers will be forever known as the directors that failed a franchise and insulted the very fans that embraced it.[換行字元][換行字元]I have no idea why they felt their finished product would pay homage to Stan Lee's legacy or the characters he brought to life but this ""closure"" to a decade of greatness was, in fact, the most disappointing 3-hours of character assassination in cinematic history."
1359,Pretty cheesey and fake. Stupid spandex outfits. Movie should have been about 5 min long it would have been easier to watch
1360,"Definitely it landed in my best movie lists. It's first time i rated 10 for any movie but this movie brings all. I got no words other than saying that it has all spices which we need. Proper ending like we want to see for our 10 years of waiting. Please run for it, because destiny arrives and it's waiting for you."

1362,Avengers Endgame is an SUPER AWESOME movie . It actually made me cry and I'm a crying person.
1363,"I like the movie, but I can't say that it's outstanding. For most fans, it should satisfy. I like the Marvel movies. None of them are perfect, which includes this one. I believe it's worth seeing if you are fan of the previous Marvel films."
1364,"Best movie i have ever watched. The feelings, the action, the pictures! Everything is as it should be, even better than that. And the ending was perfect! Gonna go re-watch tommorrow"
1365,"The movie offers great fan service and some of the scenes are beyond epic, I really enjoyed it. Yet, some of the scenes at the end don't make sense in addition to leaving some things for the imagination (no closure)."
1366,They landed the plane. You cannot do a better job of ending a gigantic story. Kudos to the Russo brothers and the entire cast.

1372,"I think this was a good movie, but it felt like I had just left a funeral when heading home from the theatre."
1373,"I'm not sure where to rate this movie because there's a lot of different angles to it. There are many plot holes. There is some humor that doesn't work as well as I'd like it to. I don't believe it's the best marvel movie. BUT... this movie is awesome. Make me feel something real from just a screen and you've achieved something and the Russo brothers did just that. Yes, the time travel logic will definitely not be accurate if you take the ""time"" (see what I did there) to dissect it, but this film did something pretty new. It connected over 20 movies into one grand conclusion that pays off better than any other piece of media that I've ever seen. Problems with the flick? A few sure. Any resentment? Pretty much none. You can't please everyone, but these guys probably did the best job they could and I love them 3000"
1374,Hulk vs thanos Thanos should've been shown more dangerous Tony & Natasha meet each other in post credit scene
1375,Best movie ever!! I cried the whole movie!! Two thumbs up!!
1376,"This movie did not deserve rating more than 7. the story was only about time travel which instantly successful in one time try. like another avengers movie there were always dispute/quarel among them, i did not understand why this things alway exist in avengers movie, although they had been a team for along time. i really do not like it, because it gives bad reputation to the superhero character. because of the time travel capability, the story had no meaning. they will always can get back to the past to fix or to prevent bad things that happened. the only exciting thing was to see all the characters in one movie. this movie rate shoud be way under the batman trilogy, which is the best superhero movie i had ever seen."
1377,"I just came back from the cinema and this movie will last forever for being able to bring out together all emotions and all those incidents in 3 hours. The movie was a bit slow in the first 80-90 minutes which comedy concentrated in somehow sometimes annoying and distracting Thor dominated over which for me could have been reduced to 30-40 minutes but still I understand the details but really the comedic scenes though they were funny were distracting sometimes for me. My scale to great endings is always harry potter and this movie really had the epic ending and very satisfying and heroic ending but still may find Harry Potter's better for some reasons. Not one of them is knowing the ending but knowing the end for some characters, also being able to predict some upcoming events in the end is a weakness in the plot which was for me the big trouble. Captain stupid Marvel was really weak and not as powerful as I thought or even much affecting and it's for the me the strongest weakest hero in the MCU and feel like they aren't able to use her even in the end and the glove and taking the stones shot which costed the traumatic yet predictable end for some character and although had a great effect in the final battle but it felt like she is the strongest with the stupidest brain to use her powers more on the contrary my favorite one which is ""Thanos"" who was not much powerful but smart enough to beat the crap out of everybody and brought enthusiasm and all the action near the end and had one of the best fight scenes ever with Captain America, another disadvantage is that Hawkeye for me still wasn't used or made a the powerful impact I was waiting for, also the soul stone though knowing that a sacrifice is a must to earn they plan for getting all the stones and all their places in old dates and incidents but yet a huge scene was made which costed a lot for such a serious thing that they didn't agree what to do for it and the time travel matter concerning their arrival together after the missions and Nebula's delay but still arriving with them along with some points in it feels like they distracted us with the following eventful incidents. The VFX in the film is a must Oscar winning one in the great finale battle with the camera angles and the simple score all were more than fantastic. The performances were very great and the direction for the Russo is an example for all time great direction and should be an example for powerful ones. The movie also had the great ability to create challenges and overcome them like the way it moves from extreme comedy to extreme drama and action, the scenario was also good and especially along the end with the good movie score, I also still believe the comedic part should have made the movie's genres include comedy for occupying much time in the film though it was very funny at parts and distracting at others but was too hilarious and well written. In the end again the final epic battle is an all time great scene with much enthusiasm that exceeds much of Infinity Wars' and again as a fan the movie deserves a 10/10 but for me along with stupid ass funny Thor😂 I would give it a 9.5/10 and what prevents me from giving it a 10/10 is being somehow predictable at some points regardless of what the ending was and I still hope Marvel never stops making movies like that and affecting on our characters by the characters and heroes of the great absent Stan Lee."
1378,"Epic finale for Avengers series. You will see massive amount of Marvel characters and many familiar places from previous movies. Big wins and big losses. But a bit too epic for me, liked previous part more. And the way to get Infinity Stones back is a slippery way, makes more questions than answers.[換行字元][換行字元]Where is Loki now?

1379,"Visuals, plot, intelligence, emotions, with great acting ....what else do you want in a movie. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have given their best with positive results. The INFINITY SAGA ends."
1380,"I promised myself I would not watch anymore Marvel movies after Infinity War because I was upset Infinity War could have ended in one movie with an extra thirty minutes like they added to this movie, but they split the movie into two movies without informing the audience to make more money and to introduce new characters into the universe. I kept my promise until I got a chance to see this movie and I gave the movie a chance. I was very impressed with this movie. It was a love letter to the diehard fans who have been with the franchise since the beginning. Every character gets their moment to shine. The characters who you figured were leaving the franchise had a satisfying send-off which made you smile at times and other times made you sad. I didn't cry watching this movie, but I laughed and smiled a lot. Thanos was a great movie villain and every time he made an appearance onscreen you could feel his intimidating presence. I loved Capt. in the third act of the movie and there is one epic moment when you gasp in excitement. And yes, I think it's a callback to that hilarious scene in Avengers: Age of Ultron. I really enjoyed this movie again. It was the older generation passing the torch to the younger generation while original Avengers received a proper sendoff and closed the chapter to the final installment of the phase one and opened the door to the next chapter of Marvel movies. There is one big question left unanswered; but seeing Spiderman 2 coming out this summer, I think we'll get the answers. The only con in this movie is Captain Marvel. She doesn't fit in. She is like the Iron Fist of the Marvel Movie Universe. She stands out like a sore thumb and I think Disney is going to turn her into a LBGT character and force her on the audience or shame fans if who don't accept her. Like I expected she was an ex machina character and I was so happy she was hardly in the movie besides a handful of scenes. Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie. It was a fun ride and proper conclusion to phase one.[換行字元][換行字元]No, this movie was not any Dark Knight Trilogy or movie masterpiece but it was entertaining and fun and answered your questions and answers and left the audience with a satisfying conclusion like all the time and energy you spent on these movies were worthwhile. In what I believe to be his final movie cameo, I think the godfather of Marvel himself, Stan Lee, would have been proud with the final product of this movie. Excellent movie you should definitely check out and enjoy."
1381,I did not expect much of the movie. Almost fell asleep from boredom.
1382,"Who would have ever thought one could cry watching Avengers? I'm not saying that I did or did I?..... but many people did. Endgame is the most emotional one of all. I couldn't get enough of it. So, I'm going for another round tomorrow. Who knows, I might go for another after that too."
1383,"Not worth it..... three hours from my life ..... Boring, long, it should be better."
1384,"The marvel delivers a epic finale to avengers series. The years of build up and introduction of new characters definitely pays off . The farwell to some epic characters will definitely hit hard to every loyal marvel fan. The movie had its moments of action, laughter , sadness , togetherness and mindblowing climax. It wont be wrong to say the climax way up higher than the actual expectations. Despite its long run time of 3 hours it stills feels less for such kind of conclusion. The movie had its share of flaws but that does not lets you feel bored even for second. There are movies which are applauded for its story and peformances in the very highly recoginzed festivals around the globe unlike them this movie is itself a festival filled with memorable characters from the marvel cinematic universe. They are the characters who have such an impact that they will remain in the hearts of people for generations to come. This movie belongs to more of scifi or fantasy genre which are far from reality but the presentation of its imagination is delivered in such a way that you get sucked into its virtual universe. There are many series , sequels or combined universe movies who have actually failed to live up to its previous installment. Unlike them marvel universe continues to get bigger better and blockbuster with every passing follow ups. This movie is highly entertaining and enchancting equally to the fans as well as beginners. It definitely deserves a perfect score as it does its best in its own genre and movies as such will be not played be on screen every year."
1385,Nice movie.Great cgi work and the performance of all the superheros was great.
1386,"Impossible to not cry. What an end, Avengers lost it's best defender."

1392,"This movie is perfection in modern cinema, great ending and gives great closure for the franchise."

Nebula's story line for two.[換行字元][換行字元]Acting was fine. Everyone was fine. But you'd think for a three hour movie there would be more inter-Avenger dialog, especially between Natasha and Cap and Clint and Banner because she's attempted relationships with all three and now that half the people are gone and she cries a lot don't you think any of the other three would want to have a relationship?[換行字元][換行字元]Frankly Infinity War was at least as good."

You will be spend quality time for sure. Experience the movie.."
1396,I did not like the film despite my long wait for the confrontation between the Avengers and Thanos was only a short time I was waiting for a film that exceeded expectations but unfortunately was otherwise
1397,"10/10 Action,Happiness,Sadness and pure joy! I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies. I will watch it again and again and again. Love 3000"
1398,Wow just amazing seen it twice was better second time around not that many movies have done that
1399,"Say goodbye to any semblance of a plot which is tied to character. This is not it. Bad writing and concept, probably born of corporate and committee-led ""creation teams"" has made these movies not into entertainment but just more fan service. When outrageous plot developments have no consequences because they can just be ""undone"" with time travel, the writers have no incentive to connect characters to decisions which permanently affect plot. The result is an empty but spectacular show full of glitter, movement, and noise. This is fine if that's what you wanted to see, but this is not a film about characters, despite its shallow attempts to bring it in for this or that moment (again, reversing all those character traits at a moments notice when it's convenient). It's disturbing to see fans rating this with 10's and ""best film ever"". One wonders if any kind of story is necessary at all to get the ""Wow"" reaction. Still, I applaud the filmmaker's efforts to add enough time to spotlight some of the characters, even if those efforts are in the end, transitory and a character mirage, to be forgotten, so that the big reset can take place. In this at least it is true to comics, and in that sense, this is a typical bit of bad comic plotting converted into film, so if praise is deserved for being true to mediocrity, at least they earned their 10/10 in that respect. Marvel movies are to film what Professional Wrestling is to the Olympics -- corrupt, shallow, and based on cheap thrills -- and worth watching only if that's what you came to see."
1400,"The end of the 11 year of journey is here and what a movie it is we cried, laugh,joy the every movement foen the movie we can't express the movie in the words. Such a beautiful work by russo brothers and mcu and what a great end is given to all cherecters."

Captain america and Iron man get finaly what they diserved!! Everyone in this movie has their shinning moment!!! In this movie i cried, i laughed, i screamed and i was going CRAZY!!! It had the right amount of drama in the begging (maybe a little bit more). The drama for me was necessary, because our heroes need to realise that they lost and that half of the entire universe has dissapeared!!! If you thought that infinity war was an epic movie wait till you see this one!!! WOW!!! I can not explain to you what i see i can not explain how epic this movie was!! you just need to go and see it!

1408,MCU gave what the true fans who sticked with them from the starting really wanted!! This is truly unforgettable experience
1409,Every Avenger Fan was waiting for this movie. finally I watched it and lot of craze was seen in theatres. You will find the same amazing style and power show of Thanos and Avengers. Story is fine till last it does not open up how and who will kill Thanos. You might be able to guess or not about climax. This movie will give you goosebumps sometimes but I think final fight scene was stretchable instead of streatching first half or because of story line makes it a long movie there was a possibility to make two parts of this movie cause story definitely needed that.
1410,"I had high hopes and was not let down. It's emotionally draining, I needed an hour afterwards just to get back to normal. Perfection folks. See this movie."
1411,"Endgame is not only an epic, intense, heart-breaking yet hilarious and satisfying conclusion to a film series, it is also a masterpiece all on its own. From the directing and cinematography to the acting (Namely RDJ, Chris Evans, Scarlet Johansson and Jeremy Renner) and one of the best scores I've ever heard in a film, thanks to Alan Silvestri. Amazing film, one of the best I've ever seen."

1413,"Wow wow wow Amazing,shocking wow wow wow wow wow wow ,love it"
1414,First half is too long and boring . Thor has been Made a caricature. Too much of importance to captain America and hulk also not used properly. Too much of focus on iron man and takes too long and even make us bore and walk out of film
1415,"Love u three thousand times This movie is truly an epic masterpiece that gives the audience one hell of a ride. Thank u Marvel Studio. Thank u, Russo brothers. Still can't believe this is the end of the original members."
1416,"Its an end of a era,If you have been watching these Movies since Iron man you have to watch this"
1417,I am utterly amazed at how well the Russo Brothers intertwined the stories lines of the Avengers and bring an end to a saga. This movie makes you connect to the characters while still being an action film. Kudos to the Marvel team.
1418,"No spoilers but it was hyped up too much, and a lot of things just felt off in this movie the jokes and circumstances. It's gonna be one of those films where you're gonna love or just feel eh"
1419,"Avengers: Endgame is a film directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. This film was my most anticipated one for this year for a number of reasons. The trailers got me pumped up and increased my anticipation even more. But after walking out of that cinema hall, I felt that the creators did justice to all that was served to us in these past 10 years.[換行字元][換行字元]Plot: The Avengers decide to reverse Thanos' action done during the events of Infitnity War.[換行字元][換行字元]Story and direction: As this will be a non-spoiler I shall try to be as generic as possible as tio what I liked and didn't like about this movie. This film is a conclusion to a long story arc that started in the beginning of this cinematic universe. Yes, the film is three hours long (by far the longest in the MCU, too) but the best thing about the film was that the film never felt that long. And, for that, I would like to give a big salute to the creative minds behind this mega-blockbuster. In each and every minute of the move, you do feel for the characters. There is a sense of human-ism which is quite rare in superhero movies, which I was a big fan of. None of the scenes felt misplaced or unnecessary. I even liked the risks that were taken with characters which too is very rare for a commercial movie. The MCU brand of humour is there in some moments and I just loved them. This film had a proper balance of tension, entertainment and laugher, which is what wants from any kind of movie. Talking about the action scenes. OMG!!! They were huge, awesome and fantastic. Also, the VFX. My God!!! I can imagine the VFX artists had to do to bring so many of these scenes to like. And I salute them in doing that in the most seamless and effortless way. Alan Silvestri has also done a wonderful job on the score. I don't remember tearing up in any movie, but I surely did in this one. This film had such a profound effect in me. But in saying that, there were some scenes that did feel like plot-holes. Also, with the announcement of so many movies and TV show spin-offs this film still didn't manage to address so many things. But these, things are any way secondary to me.[換行字元][換行字元]Performances: Now if I list each and every cast member and their performances, this review will go on and on. But still, I will do some highlighting. People have been wanting Robert Downey Jr to be nominated Best Actor for the Oscars next year. And I really hope they do because this was the best of Tony Stark in the MCU. Chris Evans as usual is fantastic and I saw a side of him in this film which wasn't even tapped on in this universe. Chris Hemsworth was the funny man in this film. His scenes just made me laugh. Same can also be said for Paul Rudd. Mark Ruffalo too was just great as the Hulk and Bruce Banner. Scarlet Johannson and Jeremy Renner made me remember what made them so special and unique in this team. Josh Brolin again was fantastic as Thanos. All the rest of the cast members too were just great and commendable.[換行字元][換行字元]Favorite Scene: This is where I am out of words. But I will say it anyway without giving away anything. I will say it will be the one during the final hour of the movie where you will feel that are heroes have nothing to do. But then there comes a ray of hope and you feel that victory will surely touch our heroes' feet. Verdict: Is this film perfect? No, absolutely not. Does this film satisfy the MCU fan? Hell yes, it absolutely does. This film just made me realise why I love movies and why my love increases every day. Its exactly for films like these that I live for. Do watch the film in 3D (IMAX, if possible) for the best experience and I am sure you will have a smile on that face yours feeling a sense of completion and happiness. If the MCU has more films up in its kitty, bring them on because I seriously would like to see what more can they give. Yup, and for the first time ever: NO POST CREDITS. So don't need to wait till the end waiting for some random scene to show up.[換行字元][換行字元]I am going with an 8.5/10."
1420,As a avid MCU fan they delivered on so many levels.
1421,It was a nice movie with a little bit of nostalgic glimpse from the past movies The only problem was the numerous potholes.
1422,"Strongly believe that infinity war was a way more superior movie, with way more memorable scenes and a buildup to an impactful ending. While endgame incorporates all the characters in the story, it makes me feel less emotion for any of them. It was not a waste of money, no doubt, but it felt like the movie was being carried by audience feels for individual characters more than an exciting plot."
1423,"Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Avengers: Endgame. For once I am at a loss for words. I have just sat through three hours of an absolute roller coaster of emotions. I laughed, I cried, there was shock, relief, and sorrow and just a little bit of awe. I have an immense amount of praise for the writers being able to draw the threads of the story together to produce such an outcome. For those of us that love the Marvel universe, I say Wow!!!!! I really can't think of anything else to say without a huge bunch of spoilers so I'm just going to say, if this is your thing......it was awesome......please go any watch it.....then go and watch it again!!!!"
1424,Not really expected that kinda of ending as it's superhero movie always gets good at end this doesn't; story and drama was good ; time traveling concept explained is confusing; little more action scenes was expected ; Already missing the lost heroes.
1425,"It was not a great movie, the previous movie was much better and I mean a lot. It could and should have been better but they tried to play it safe. I did enjoy the movie but when people talk about standing ovation I just roll my eyes. This is what worries me to much of this from fan boys that can see know wrong most watch without seeing.[換行字元][換行字元]Even though I did like this move some parts just bug me like the messy theories of time travel. Infact they made a mess of time travel theory and please dont tell me oh yeah its the Grandfather Paradox. The fact is so much was dependent on the past that if Thanos didnt do all those things as well as some of the others then much of the present would not be the same regardless of how you put it. The Guardians of the Galaxy would never had met Gamora so they would not know her etc"
1426,"I watch the 10pm show. Now at 2pm, i still can't sleep trying to digest all the awesomeness that i've just witness. It's a perfect conclusion to the Infinity saga. You think you know how it's going to end? Believe me you don't. The 3 hours runtime just pass you by. After the you will be hoping for another 3 hours. Unfortunately guys, every journey has an end. Glad to say this franchise does end with a BANG!!!"
1427,It can't get any better than this. A perfect end to the story.
1428,There is fantastic and wonderful and the film wonderful
1429,Never before has a movie made my jaw drop so many times before nor made me want to jump up and down in the theater like a kid on Christmas morning!
1430,Not As Per Expectation ..the story is not that much catchy....only 4d effects of war scenes were amazing
1431,"OK I know there's a lot of hype for this movie but when you look past the fact that we've all been super excited because we've been waiting for a long time and you stop to think about what you just watched, there's a whole bunch of things that don't make sense. The effects are insane the movie itself is beautiful but I really hate the storyline and how they decided to go with it."
1432,Endgame is a very satisfying conclusion to the infinity saga. It does justice to the characters and has plenty of references to previous movies to reward the MCU followers with.
1433,"Watch this movie, it can be far worse! I understand that Infinity War set a high bar but this one is a joke; time travel, better known as ""deus ex machina"" for lazy writing, is primary thing here that was never explained.[換行字元][換行字元]And trust me, that is the least of the problems![換行字元][換行字元]Yes, the effects were nice so hence 2/10 but effects were never so important in Avengers; others at least had some sort of story and action, this one is dull."
1434,"I have never reviewed anything in my life but i needed to, just for this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]PLEASE see this movie. it is the most intense marvel movie to exist, and i cannot express enough how incredible it is. it's funny, and heartbreaking and so intense.[換行字元][換行字元]i am so happy that this phase ended in this way, with a movie that is so almost perfect. the acting was incredible and moving the entire way through (where is RDJ's oscar at?) so.. i guess what i want to say is ; please go see this movie. ok thank you i love steve rogers :)"
1435,This is what all fans where asking for. It will hopefully beat avatar in box office
1436,"I wasn't that keen on ENDGAME, there... I said it. I went into this film with high expectations (thanks to all the hype/money it's made/phenomenon that was INFINITY WAR) and was rather let down. There were two real problems with this movie: 1) it's WAY too long and subsequently becomes rather unfocused on reaching it's conclusion. 2) it is just plain BORING for it's opening 2 hours and a half! There's no material that grips me/makes me say ""wow"", unlike INFINITY WAR which blew my socks off within the first 10 minutes.[換行字元][換行字元]There are several plot lines that are both uninteresting and unnecessary. I'm all up for character-building, but do we need much more character-building after 15 WHOLE MOVIES, and does it really have to take up 2 AND A HALF HOURS OF SCREEN TIME?!! I don't mind a film needing a build-up but this was quite frankly RIDICULOUS, especially when (despite being 2 hours and 40 minutes) INFINITY WAR cut to the chase pretty quickly while still making us feel for the characters.[換行字元][換行字元]However, to say that ENDGAME was a total loss would be untrue. The final quarter/ending of the movie will leave you awestruck and sad! It's a brilliant ending that fires on all four cylinders, so it's just a shame that the rest of the movie had to be so tedious/unnecessarily stretched-out!"
1437,"I would go back in time and watch it again for the first time. The best superheroes movie and also one of the best movies ever made. Filled with emotion, action, jokes mixed as a perfect blend."
1438,"I laughed, I got teary eyed, I cheered, among many feelings. This film was a perfect culmination of the past 10/11 years. With call backs to every MCU movie, with many surprises and moments this film is just as epic as people are hyping it up to be.[換行字元]20/10"
1439,"It's easy to be jaded. So many great shows and movie series build up and up, only to end with a whimper, retroactively stripping the earlier material of much of its quality. They get you to care about the characters, they get you involved in the plot, only to pull a ridiculous left turn or lose their way entirely, hobbling off into oblivion.[換行字元][換行字元]Marvel could have joined those ranks. In fact, it was hard to see how they wouldn't do that. With all they'd built up over a decade plus, if they didn't deliver a great finale, it would have cast a retroactive shadow. Thankfully, I'm happy to say, they delivered all they needed to and more, cementing what will become known as the ""Infinity Saga"" as a generation-defining cultural behemoth that my kids will show their kids just as I've shared Star Wars with my own.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is just over 3 hours, but it very much needs all of that time to tell the story it needs to tell. The scale of this thing is mind-boggling. So many huge actors. So many characters. It could have been a mess.[換行字元][換行字元]Instead, it hits all its marks expertly. It is both genuinely funny and genuinely emotional. The action serves a purpose and can be followed. The characters follow unforced, natural arcs that don't feel contrived or predetermined.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie focuses on Iron Man and Captain America above all, which is appropriate - they have been the divided (sometimes violently so) heart of the Avengers since at least Civil War, and their somewhat competing visions have shaped everything else. In the end, I left with an overwhelming sense that the story had gone exactly where it needed to go. It was fulfilling. I am in awe of the fact that they pulled this off."
1440,"This was supposed to be the final movie that crowed the franchise and Infinity War set high expectations. I was utterly disappointed. The plot doesn't make sense and throws away a lot of character development, to the point that some of them are just shallow version of what they were in other movies (and could become).[換行字元][換行字元]But what really annoyed me was the sentimentalism that permeated the whole movie. It is like you have to shed a tear for every character and the movie is trying to make you cry in scenes that don't move the plot forward. If in Infinity War they really stroke a good balance between action and emotion, here they just are there for the sake of it."
1441,I love that film. I love Marvel and I love the way they lead us from the beginning to the wonderful end. It's awesome!!
1442,I was thinking it's gonna the perfect cbm movie of all time it's a big disappointment it's really bad a big mess of events and characters jumping in middle of the another one it's worst then josstice league
1443,"I laughed, I screamed, I cried but most of all I felt an emotional attachment to it. Really Marvel and The Russo Brothers pulled of a grand conclusion. I am going to watch again and again but still I don't find the EndGame to end watching."
1444,"A cathartic, satisfying experience for all MCU fans that have been around from the start, Endgame is full of callbacks and emotional payoffs years in the making. The stakes are real. The character arcs justified, balanced, and well-executed. The emotions tangible, delivered fantastically by every actor, particularly the original six. The action is exciting, but doesn't take center stage until it needs to. The humor and heart truly make this movie. There are some complaints that will be made about certain character choices and"

1447,"You need to see all previous MCU movies if you want truly enjoy it. Yeah, you can nitpick and say there is several plot holes but with a movie of this scale they did an amazing job. Greatest movie for MCU fans! I love you 3000!"

1450,"I'm not a fan of the Marvel series. However I have always given them a chance. I feel they sometimes sell themselves very short and bombard us with so much poor CGI we don't know where to look next. The comedy has always been a bit cringe worthy and on the whole I've never wanted to go back and watch for a second time. Endgame has finally changed that. I laughed, I had a lump in my throat and I didn't have a headache from the constant bombardment of over the top scenes. I've felt that Marvel could do what the makers of the recent Star Wars movies have done and that's strip back the cgi and actually make something of a movie. It felt to a point that they tried to that here. But. It isn't perfect. It's long. The first 2/3rds are such a slow burn you start to wonder when it would finally get going. The small pockets of Thor's funny scenes are just about enough to save it. For Marvel fans I imagine they will be talking about it for years to come but for regular movie goers. It's enjoyable."

1455,What a horrible way to end. A waste of 11 years. So sad.
1456,"This is Marvel's most epic film, and possibly the whole history of cinema. Dramatic, profound, with comedy, TOO EMOTIONAL, and a great final worthy and good closing for our heroes.

1462,My eyes sweated and I have no sweat glands wow. So good 10/10 frick the haters come on marvel
1463,"That is a typical example of a movie trying to squeeze juice out of a story that falls short. X-men finished their old-cast franchise so much better, and darker, and better (sorry did I say better before...), yeah much better.

The culmination of the last 11 years of Marvel movies has lead to this epic conclusion of the pinnacle of the infinity saga. The movie defied all odds and absolutely crushed it out of the park. Brimmed with emotions and swashbuckling fiesta. Avengers: Endgame delivers."
1468,I have never left a review for a movie ever but this is literally the best movie. BEST MOVIE. If you are a marvel fan you will adore this movie.
1469,"This movie was made for the fans of the mcu who has been following the movies for years. If i could describe it, its a fitting ending for the all the movies we've seen so far. Lots of nostalgia moments, lots of callbacks from previous films. As a fan, i felt they delivered. We got a ending we deserve. Act 3 was amazing, audience was rowdy for the final battle. I haven't went back to the theatres to watch a movie again since rotk. I feel as a fan, and what the mcu has provided me for the last 10 years, i should support the movie again."
1470,"I watched this film on the opening day and I left disappointed. This movie is too fast paced and too easy plot with tons of loopholes. Infinity War was a great film compared to it and Guardians of Galaxy, Ironman series, Captain America 1 were far better movies than this one. Endgame is running on hype and the total collection seems huge because of way too overpriced movie tickets. This movie is made for only children of age under 12."
1471,"I have no words to describe how amazing the movie was and how satisfied I am. Totally the perfect way to end a movie, really is perfect in every way with the exact amount of everything."
1472,"Decimated and beaten. With all the dust settled (sorry) from the end of Infinity War, this is how Avengers: Endgame begins for earth's mightiest heroes. After 21 previous films and 11 years building to this point in the MCU, the expectations for Endgame are undoubtedly huge and theories on how they will conclude the Infinity Saga have been running wild.[換行字元][換行字元]After Thanos (Josh Brolin) wiped out half the living population in the universe, what's left of the Avengers must reassemble once more to undo Thanos' actions and restore order to the universe.[換行字元][換行字元]It's near impossible to discuss the narrative of Endgame without spoiling the film for everyone so the best I can do is that Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have done a great job in giving the film three distinctive acts. Each act offers a range of different emotions but all three of them together combine to make a superhero film that really does define exactly what an epic is, working as a love letter to the entire backlog of MCU films and their audience in the process.[換行字元][換行字元]The Russo brothers, who have been at the helm for, now including Endgame, four of the very best MCU films, really do deserve all the praise they get for how they handle the roster of characters on show. Being the culmination of the Infinity Saga, there are some huge moments that provide such a satisfying pay-off for anyone who's been majorly invested in these stories and characters, like myself, since Iron Man back in 2008. The brothers know how much these characters mean to some so it's great to see them ensure a rousing finale is provided for all to sit back and admire.[換行字元][換行字元]The action is rather subtle for the first two acts but it's delivered amongst some fantastic callbacks that feel deeply nostalgic, even though they're only from within the past decade. There's a number of brilliant surprises along the way that brought out nothing but a feeling of sheer joy. It's when the film reaches it's third and final act where things reach such a level of crowd-pleasing fan service that I couldn't help but let out a few screams. Trust me though, I wasn't the only one. It's as big as expected, particularly on an IMAX screen where the film really does flourish, and there's one moment in particular that floored me, a shot that will go down as one of the greatest in the superhero genre.[換行字元][換行字元]Coming to the performances, Endgame really does belong to the original six members of the initial Avengers cast; Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner. With a film juggling so many characters, these six get the majority of screen time and Downey Jr. and Evans are the two major stand-outs in Endgame, both giving possibly their best performances in their respective roles. Hemsworth continues to deliver on the comedic aspect of Thor while Ruffalo brings probably my favourite iteration of the Hulk within the MCU to life brilliantly. Johansson and Renner have always felt like the Avengers no one really cares about however, I think things might be about to change because they get a real chance to shine in this one.[換行字元][換行字元]Outside of the original six, the rest of the cast (and what a cast) just suit their roles down to a tee. Paul Rudd has a larger role than I thought he'd have and that's a good thing because the man just brings the entertainment factor to the team that feels different to what everyone else brings. Josh Brolin returns as Thanos and, while his presence isn't as impactful as in Infinity War, it's great to see the performance of an actor like Brolin brought to life through the motion-capture wizardry that we know looks seamless enough now to not hinder a film.[換行字元][換行字元]Accompanied by Alan Silvestri's brilliantly rousing score, Avengers: Endgame is a cinematic event for the ages. Not only is it the closing chapter of a 22 film arc, it's a celebration of what makes these films and their characters so special to the millions that have supported the MCU since its inception back in 2008 with Iron Man. It's a sprawling epic that will make you laugh hard one moment before reducing you to tears the next, and if that's not enough, even the end credits are suitably epic for such a triumphant finale."

1489,"Watched this on first day of opening. I was holding really high hopes, based on Infinity war, and i was really dissapointed. This movie has some good parts, and im ok with the final result, but the journey there was bad and really messed up. In general the whole movie felt like the main story is a couple of actors (and here i really mean actors, not theirs fictional characters) saying goodbye to marvel and mcu. Infinity war, Thanos, infinity stones, fate of universe, etc, seems just like a minor side story. Very, very sad waste of 3 hours."

1493,"I've expected much more as it was the final chapter but to be honest infinity war was much more interesting and mind banding, the story happened in the end game I expected them almost all of them before watching the movie so I was waiting to be proved wrong and get excited unfortunately I wasn't, End game was more emotional rather than interesting, they paid too much attention to viewers satisfaction they did what emotional viewers would have wanted.[換行字元][換行字元]End of the story"
1494,This was a film made for fans. it was based off of the comic in certain scenes but overall this film was a good conclusion to an amazing line of films.
1495,Walking into endgame I thought I knew what was gonna happen but wow I sure was wrong with all the twists and turns this movie takes. It really did pay off this giant cinematic universe that marvel did
1496,"For marvel fans, each every second of the movie is a pure bliss. But for general audience the first 30 minutes is a bit boring. But that sets up the second act of the movie which is absolutely awesome. The movie is not only about emotional pay offs to our favourite characters. The movie is also a lot of fun. The directors have somehow managed to give an emotionally satisfying end to this 22 movie infinity saga and also set up phase 4. The last hour of the movie will be the best hour of your entire life. I'm pretty sure there's nothing like that before and there will be nothing like that after too. It's too hard to make a movie like this. I think even marvel won't make an epic movie like this again. Even though this movie has a lot of surprises that can only be enjoyed to the fullest at first watch, you won't stop it with one watch. Trust me, I'm posting this review after three watches."
1497,This is a good film but not a masterpiece as some are saying. Is waaay too long at 3 hours. There are some nice moments throughout the film and some good acting but I wasn't blown away with it all. Not sure it is going to be a consistent repeat viewing blu ray when it comes out but maybe at 48 I am getting too old for all this comic book stuff.

1504,"I can't review it, cannot be described with words, experience it yourself on theatre guys! It's really THE ENDGAME! Whatever the expectations i had, it had gone even beyond that whatsoever!!! Just watch it without knowing any spoilers! 11 years of hardwork paid off, GG Marvel!"
1505,Just saw Avengers Endgame and I feel disappointed. I loved Infinity War and seeing this makes me want to just end the story with Thanos winning in the last film. The humor was entertaining but severely misplaced. Many characters did not feel like themselves and even with all the references to past marvel films I feel cheated. I don't want to spoil anything for you guys so i'm just gonna leave it there.
1506,"Was a good movie but it just needed a bit more to it, it wasn't as good as they said it would be and not much really happened."
1507,It's just the hype of the actors for which the audience are getting excited.
1508,"Endgame[換行字元][換行字元]This is most definitely one for the fans, quite impossible to understand the main plot or the nuanced references unless you had watched the previous 22 movies.[換行字元][換行字元]Well I have and I thought overall it was brilliant, I watched it in the 3D 4 DX version and though the rain and lightening good fun was had by all. The three hours flew by to the redemptive conclusion.[換行字元][換行字元]I will list the really good aspects and the not so good[換行字元][換行字元]1, we had lots of humour, well placed and well timed it was genuinely funny.[換行字元][換行字元]2, the action sequences were great and were not overly long, just about right I would say.[換行字元][換行字元]3, the plot, whilst fantastical, held together, great![換行字元][換行字元]4, Captain Marvel was not invincible, and looked more like the superhero she is, so this worked.[換行字元][換行字元]5, fine bromance elements.[換行字元][換行字元]6, Hulk's transformation was a master-stroke[換行字元][換行字元]Now the not so good[換行字元][換行字元]1, the beginning had slow dialogue that just was not meaningful, baggy is the word![換行字元][換行字元]2, why they felt the need to have absolutely every Marvel character including the minors turned into an obsession, this proved to be overwhelmingly.[換行字元][換行字元]3, the music was unmemorable, pity![換行字元][換行字元]4, we needed Thor restored earlier as an Apollonian god.[換行字元][換行字元]5, the sexy element of Marvel superheroes was dumbed out, there was no one to dream about.[換行字元][換行字元]I loved this movie and for Marvel fans this delivers the goods and they will find no fault."
1509,"The first 2 hours of the movie were pretty boring. Great last hour but, boy, was I ready to get to the final hour. Did love last scene with Cap America. Won't say anything more. CA:WS and first Avengers were my faves. This ranks probably #3 or #4 of the Marvel movies. Plus sweet cameo by Stan Lee. Would have been funnier if he had not died recently. Bitter sweet."
1510,"This one is for sure the best superhero movie ever made. Infinity wars took marvel to another level and boy this one toppled that one too. I laughed too hard I came back with a stomach ache. And i cried and so did every single person in the theater. And of course that edge of the seat action took me for ride. I am a big marvel fan from 10 years. It was every thing I wanted and expected it to be and even much much more. They couldn't have concluded the 10 year saga in a more epic way. Loved every part of the movie. Would watch it again atleast once for sure. Thank you marvel for this great journey. Dont know how are they going to top this one. But its marvel we are talking about, they always know how to pull it off. :D"
1511,"From a surprise starting ten minutes to great character development through to the best action with heart stopping events, this movie is amazing!! So many cheer worthy surprises & welcome developments,both the casual or diehard fan will be very happy."
1512,After watching movie I thought of all the possible ways they can do and compared with each possible theories I have heard till now but no one can match to this one and the way they done it..!!
1513,"Just another dumb kids movie, with some tacked-on grrl power BS. Quite disappointing and unnecessarily overlong. I was surprised to see Supergirl make a cameo appearance, especially in a Marvel movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Something for the teens to get excited about, but a long 3 hours for any intelligent adult."
1514,"After watch infinity war, the expectation was so high. I never imagine that endgame going to be a different way, but they did it. They did it a film so emotional, so different to I was expect. But this don't say the film is bad, for me, just did it inferior to infity war."
1515,"Where do I begin.[換行字元][換行字元]From start of the film to the end, my emotions for the characters that had made an impact on 10 years of my life on the big screen coming together in such a way. Incredible!![換行字元][換行字元]This film, will go down in history as one of the greats due to its effect on its fans, its charisma and character development that has built foundations for more heroes to be implemented but more importantly the legacy its created and the future it has to offer.[換行字元][換行字元]If you get the chance to go, go. As I know I will be going as many times as I can, as that film is without a doubt flawless, no matter what the haters say."
1516,"I swear this movie is the worst thing i've ever seen of my life. Marvel, it's over for me"
1517,"I can't say more than that I have enjoyed every single second! People and even some critics can't stop complaining about the length of this movie, which doesn't line up to the fact that this is the end (together with far from home) of an era containing 22 movies! What else is there to say? Well, I didn't have such a great time in cinema for a year, the last one was Infinity War;) To come to an end: Every emotion was affected by this movie, literally EVERY emotion! From joy to anger, over to fear, ending in sadness...This is one of the best movies in the past 7 years! So if you haven't seen it yet: Go ahead!!!"
1518,"11 years, 22 movies. It has been the best cinematographic experience of my life. Thank you, thank you and thank you."
1519,Loved every minute. So good it didn't feel like a 3 hour movie! Amazing!
1520,"The most epic MCU story ever made! Thanks to russo's brother for directed well. And thanks to K Feige, to chose russo's brother."
1521,"The movie makes you laugh, cry, and walk out filling fulfilled. Watching every movie, going on the rollercoaster with them. One that every marvel fan should enjoy!!!!"
1522,"If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews. Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:[換行字元][換行字元]The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie."
1523,"I've only been a true MCU fan for the last five years, but I don't think I could find enough words in my lifetime to really express how much this movie meant to me- especially the finale. Endgame does have flaws, it's not perfect, but it's highs outweigh those flaws. It brings the whole universe full circle and allows fans to satisfyingly say goodbye to some of their favorite characters. It's the one Marvel movie that has truly earned the descriptor of Marvelous."
1524,"This movie is an absolute blast, I tell ya! Me & my university coursemates definitely had the time of our lives! Endgame literally surpasses Infinity War in a ginormous way! There's so much going on in this movie that I really wanna tell u all guys, but I can't, so sorry. I'd never, ever, never, spoil the Endgame. Anyway, as usual, spoiler-free, let's move on to the parts of my review:[換行字元][換行字元]1.0. Story: The overall story is quite straightforward and a lot more interesting compared to Infinity War. It also serves as the most perfect, epic conclusion to the adventures of all the previous MCU movies. But first, you guys need to watch all those movies from Iron Man until Captain Marvel to see where the story actually goes or you'll be completely lost with tons of questions in your head. Not to mention there are a lot, I mean it, a lot of fan-pleasing Marvel comic references, MCU scenes, easter eggs and surprise cameos that will completely and pleasantly remind you of all the previous movies, with all of them being executed so well. In other words, a nostalgia trip. Unlike Infinity War, it's an entirely fresh new story not based on any existing Marvel comic. Even some of the existing fan theories eventually proved correct all along in this movie, but which ones? Can't tell you. What I can tell is it has a lot of unexpected twists and turns, even the tone will constantly change from light-hearted to dark and moody and vice versa. But get ready for the a few ginormous surprises that will make all moviegoers cheer and clap, including the audience I was with today for the first time. 😉 Also, there are two scenes which will make you cry so badly like I did just now: one in the middle and one in the ending. Speaking of which, the ending is actually a bittersweet one. Note: No post-credits scenes, but you're gonna love what they did with the credits. With the Marvel Studios logo at the very end, you'll hear a familiar sound that takes you back straight to 2008. 😉[換行字元][換行字元]2.0. Characters: 2.1. Main characters Unlike Infinity War, the main focus is the original 6 Avengers with the addition of War Machine, Ant-Man, Rocket Raccoon & Nebula. Why I don't mention Okoye and Captain Marvel? The answer is in the movie yet I can't spoil it out. there are a few main chemistries here which I'm gonna put more emphasis on: 2.1.1. Iron Man with Captain America and Ant-Man The uttermost important character chemistry in this movie. There was a bit of emotional tension due to what happened in Civil War, but as the story progresses, that's where things are gonna get a lot more interesting. We're gonna have tons of enjoyable, memorable moments and a hell lot of laughter from this trio, even Captain America has his own LOL moments now.[換行字元][換行字元]2.1.2. Thor with Rocket Raccoon and Hulk Easily the funniest character chemistry in this movie. Rocket doesn't trash talk too much in this movie, but both Thor and Hulk completely stole the show in every scene they're in due to their awkwardness. You absolutely can't deny you're gonna laugh out loud so hard every time you see them. Still, there's a bit of emotional scenes between them.[換行字元][換行字元]2.1.3. Black Widow with Hawkeye The second most emotional character chemistry, but there are quite some great moments together which will remind you of what they did before in the past several movies, like how strong their friendship is over the years.[換行字元][換行字元]2.2. Supporting characters Hate to say it, but Okoye and Captain Marvel are just side characters only. What did they do, and what was their role? Can tell you nothing, absolutely nothing. Other than that, get ready for the surprise returns of several characters from several of the previous movies. 😉 Now moving on to villains, is Thanos still the bad guy around or did he turn a new leaf and help the Avengers? Are the Infinity Stones themselves turned out to be the bad ones like some fans have suggested? Can't say, nor I can confirm any of it is correct, so sorry...[換行字元][換行字元]3.0. Action scenes I can say all its action scenes are infinitely satisfying, enjoyable and memorable to watch, but one of them is the actual real deal and you will never deny it will make you clap and cheer out loud once it happens, including the audience I was with today for the first time. As a means of comparison, no MCU movie, not even Infinity War, can top this. Literally!! Just like whatever MCU movie the Russo Brothers have directed, the action is stunning and fast-paced, like the characters never held back their strength and completely mustered them on battles.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, it's safe to say that this is the not only best MCU movie after Infinity War, but also the most satisfying conclusion to the journey of all 21 MCU movies, just like what Kevin Feige, our most favourite president and producer of Marvel Studios, said. 😉 I safely assure all long-time fans of Marvel and the MCU will never be disappointed after seeing this, even after years, months and days of waiting for the tickets. It's also worth the money too, so no worries. Kudos to the Russo Brothers who completely nailed all aspects of this movie, and their hard work of making a 3-hour (not so long IMHO) movie is completely worth it and absolutely rewarding, and every second of it is never boring at all! I also wanna say a million congratulations to all the actors, actresses, and all the crew behind this film for making Avengers: Endgame the most legendary MCU film ever, and it even shares the spot with Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Thank you all for doing a really fantastic job of making all fans' dreams a reality which no one would ever forget. We are all so grateful for whatever you guys have done for these 11 years, for all these characters and movies have already become part of us.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall score: Infinity/10 !!!!"
1525,"You remember, when kids, how cool it was when Bruce Banner got mad and became hulk without control? How cool the old spiderman movies were (tobey mcguire as actor)? Superhero movies have become franchising for kids, making them more funny than how they were before and they just feel different. I can really see that they are targeting little kids. These movies are NOT anymore for older people too.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie was most of the time trying to be funny, sometime being, but the superhero part was just not feeling like it made me feel years ago (even the first avenger movie was cool). That feeling of ""Omg, wow, this gavee me goosebumps"" is gone with Marvel's movies. Hulk that became rational and not anymore the violent Irrational beast? Thor fat and drunk? Other characters just boring. Superheroes movies don't feel like it anymore. They are cute for little kids but I felt really stupid watching it as a 25 years old."
1526,"Best Marvel movie to date. Actors are fantastic, Very emotional and the effects are flawless. Wanted to go straight back in to watch again."
1527,You can't stop to watch because this movie is perfect in all aspects
1528,"I won't say much but this was the greatest movie theater experience I've had since Avatar. I see there's a lot of one star terrorists who would never be satisfied, or who only believe in arthouse type movies that are non-fiction. If that's you, then ignore this review. We'll both be better off.[換行字元][換行字元]The emotion, the tender love between characters who have been developed over the last 15 years, and just the general willingness to sacrifice everything for the greater good truly make the writing click in both infinity war and endgame. In addition, the writers were careful not to make it a requirement to see all 21 films leading up to this. Yeah, seeing infinity war and probably age of ultron is a must, and it will help you enjoy it more to remember some of the references from Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and the two Guardians of the Galaxy films, but generally, infinity war explains anything you may not now going into it.[換行字元][換行字元]As for the common complaint that 3 hours is too long, I will disagree. This is an end to a series on an unprecedented scale and it is totally worth your time."
1529,"Dear Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige,[換行字元][換行字元]It takes more than being a brilliant Visionary to envision all the 22 movies in a franchise, with all of them intricately and intensively interconnected, leading to an epic showdown over the last 11 years. It takes the mind of a maverick genius to give something so incredibly consistent ever seen in any franchise in the history of Hollywood, never ceasing to amaze us and being mindblown everytime we see a sequel. Be it the Star you chose to play a Superhero or the Filmmaker to direct, they were just tailor-made for perfection, executing your stellar vision. Thank you for taking Superhero genre to the highest level with that epic storytelling, mind-boggling CGI and adrenaline pumping action with every single movie. You made even the lesser known or never heard of Superheroes, the greatest hits and maximum glorification. If 'Epitome of Strategy' in Motion Pictures had a face, it would be yours and your Superpowers is to conjure runaway blockbusters![換行字元][換行字元]And as for Avengers: Endgame, the zenith of the MCU franchise, it was absolutely worth all the wait! The final war at the end simply swept us off our feet, got us cheering the loudest and it was as if all your fanboy wet-dreams became a reality. A BIG shout-out to the Russo Brothers for making Avengers one of the most ambitious projects in any Comicbook Universe and an epic finale you'll remember forever. Thank you for all the fantastic Entertainment, those tears of happiness and taking us to a parallel dimension altogether, everytime the lights dimmed and the Bigscreen lit up! Adieu Avengers saga and Phase 3!"
1530,"Please, #Academy . Please award the #MCU SOMETHING for the incredible movie feat they just pulled off after 21 films and the concluding #AvengersEndgame Wow. You can read my spoiler-free #moviereview at Movie Review Mom"
1531,"I found everything thing, from shedding tears to laughing, action, comedy, love, and now I want to tell that I m lucky that I have followed marvel series and watched endgame, it's pleasure to watch it, people who watch these movies from starting will feel connected to some characters, this movie (endgame)increases my love and respect for marvel to another level. If i continue on writing, it never stops, it's just like words are not enough for this movie guys, all i want to say that I want to watch this movie again as my last movie in my last days....thank you mr. Stan lee, Russo brothers, mr. Martin goodman, all actors and actresses, and all marvel team."
1532,"When the focus is on a few characters, this film shines but the overall focus is blurry-literally and metaphorically. I'm not kidding. Imagine one of your favorite Marvel characters having an awesome fight with some adversaries and the gigantic IMAX image on screen is cropped so that you see only the hero's head, shoulders, belt buckle and arms only up to the wrists because the baddie he or she is fighting is completely out of the frame. When you see the credits and see the leagues and leagues of artists who worked on this thing that were sacrificed on the pyre where they burned the steadicam or the glidecam and an editor that needs to cut from one place to another every two seconds and needed a strong sedative, you will long for a Spielberg, a Ridley Scott, a John Ford or a Hitchcock who knew how to frame things and didn't let the camera and editors run wild."
1533,"In the end, when Cap is saying his last goodbye to Sam, after his has lived a life with Peggy, WHY DOESN'T HE HAS A MOMENT WITH BUCKY TOO?! He's his best friend, his only family from 1940s and they go way back...I'm pissed"
1534,"The title says it all. Plus this movie had toooo manyy flaws, which I am totally willing to ignore. Which movie does not?[換行字元][換行字元]But clearly they should have at least taken some more time and get their stories in sync and correct."
1535,"Every penny worth to watch! <3[換行字元][換行字元]A great and accomplished emotional roller coaster story. Got me into tears many times, and constant gave me goosebumps <3"
1536,So let me start of by saying that the movie was good. But it was not as good as Infinity war. The movie starts off very instant and with no real lead to the previous one. It also has a very slow build up i mean literally nothing happens for 75% of the movie. I wish they would have made more happen during that 3/4 were as in infinity war they had stuff happen all the time from start to finnish.[換行字元][換行字元]I can also add that cm was absolutely not needed for this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Pretty bad review i know but that's my honest opinion and a rightful one. People praising this movie to the stars are blinded for sure.[換行字元][換行字元]It's a good movie in the sense that it's watchable and has some fun and good times mostly with Thor and then a goodbye that leaves you with tears.[換行字元][換行字元]But nothing compared to Infinity war.[換行字元][換行字元]7/10 stars while i would have given infinity war 9/10.
1537,"One word: awesome To be able to write this is amazing, massive respect. Fell from intense sadness into euphoria multiple times, moved to tears by both; a true masterpiece reflecting the fine line between hope and despair, bravery and fear, life and death"
1538,It was an emotional rollercoaster to say the least if you are coming into marvel for the first it may not impact you the way it impacted me and you may not understand much but if you love marvel and invested in marvel i highly recommend seeing endgame.
1539,"There's holes in the story of endgame and holes in the mcu itself, but try making a full 22 movie cinematic universe that is at least 95% fit together. The movie brings this era to a close and I could not be more prouder to be apart of this era and to witness it from start to finish, every single movie. Truly amazing"
1540,"Without spoiling anything, all you need to know is the movie is:[換行字元][換行字元]ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL PERFECTION![換行字元][換行字元]Go see it NOW before anything does get spoiled for you!"
1541,Nothing more to say. Movie was awesome! But my review is too short so I need to keep until[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]Nevermind still too short.
1542,"Excellent script, fantastic story, got to spend the right amount of time with the characters."
1543,"Epic movie yes, solid, fun and entertaining but battle should be longer with more combat moments to be perfect. Maybe at director's cut?"
1544,"And not in a good way.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie is one of the most ambitious movies to ever be made, that alone makes it a cinematic moment to be remembered, however this whole movie is eerily predictable. As you venture through the 3 hour flick, you are met with predictable plot points, very shallow and faux humor that tries to break tension, and a very lacking character growth from point A to point B. Sure, if you were to watch ALL of the 22 movies of the MCU you'd see the arch, but in this movie, especially in the main characters, we don't see a change during its run. Characters make decisions that dont really fit their personality and overall it just leaves the 3 hour venture shallow and dry. It is 2 and half hours of filler with really just two scenes of significance.[換行字元][換行字元]That being said, the visuals are great, the score is better than most Marvel movies and this is a great wrap to a disappointing Phase 3 of the MCU series"
1545,"I just loved the movie. It has everything happiness, sadness, comedy , tragedy . Loved the subtle references to the past and how everything was balanced , how every character got the perfect closure"
1546,Best superhero movie ever you most watch you will never forget
1547,"Dont miss in 3d theater,perfect finish,every actor gave theirs best perfomance,ultimate entertainment,have all love comercial,centiment and action"
1548,"So time travel. This just doesn't really ever work well, but as best it can the film tries. It goes the unexpected consequences route, and the new timeline route.[換行字元][換行字元]There is some bravery pathos and humour in the aftermath of Thanos, and this gives the film a stronger emotional base than usual.[換行字元][換行字元]I like the fact that Thanos is still smarter and ultimately more principled than the Avengers.[換行字元][換行字元]But we get the usual dilution because of the number of characters not really involved. Or who just pose. And Captain Marvel appears to have suffered some reduction in her role, but still looks highly unbalanced.[換行字元][換行字元]But the strength of the film is in the end which while not amazing is one of the better series ends I have seen."
1549,"The best way to finish your favorite series , thanks to everyone"
1550,Though Stan Lee's cameo could've been better. Nuff Said! Excelsior!!! ;)
1551,"Remember we are at the Endgame now. To be able to conclude all the 21 of interrelated marvel movies in one finale is a feat that took years of planning and perfection. All the movies to reach this epic conclusion is just a scene where you need to know its importance. A true ending that is both heart warming to a great departure of our marvel heroes. Go, watch and experience this masterpiece that will be remembered from years to come!"
1552,Rating 10/10 Absolute perfection end game !! Good acting performance to all the characters. Great cgi's. Truly epic & perfect ending to a long journey of marvel movie. Go see it you wont regret it !! Perfection Marvel Endgame !!
1553,"Endgame is an absolute cinematic masterpiece. Everything from the story, to the acting, to the music, to the action, and EVEN to the cinematography is incredible. This movie is all killer, and as a result feels much shorter than the lengthy 3-hour runtime, which is earned with fantastic character moments and payoffs throughout the movie. The movie brings out every possible emotion a film can. Endgame is hilarious, dark, depressing, intriguing, heartbreaking and satisfying all throughout, making it the most powerful cinematic experience I have ever been privileged to watch. If I could give it an 11/10 I would. Marvel has seriously surpassed all expectations by 1000 with this one."
1554,"If the Russo Brothers do not win an oscar for this film, that is blasphemy."
1555,Good fight scene ....but longest most dragged out movie....
1556,Potboiler at best ... confusing to say the least. This was just an opportunity for these actors to make a shed load of money without trying. How it ever got 8.6 is beyond me ..
1557,"Just like Iron Man 3, there was way too much Disney and not enough super hero. Infinity War was infinitely better (pun intended), and just like the Iron Man series, I've watched the first ones multiple times but the last only once. I won't watch this again and should have waited until it came out on bluray. There wasn't a whole lot that was shocking, a lot was predictable if you've been paying attention, and a lot had too much Disney influence. There were a lot of people in the theater checking their phones and had head resting on their hands before this was even over. Disney has wrecked another franchise."
1558,This movie will definitely lasts the cruelty of time . My expectations were high but marvel never fails to entertain us and the movie was above my expectations...
1559,"This movie contains everything that a comic based superheros movie must have. It has perfectly timed funny jokes, Jaw dropping action scenes and an unpredictable story with various twists. Also acting of everyone is awesome. If you have seen all the previous marvel movies then you are surely going to love this one, if you haven't watched I recommend you to do so or else you won't understand some important things in this movie."
1560,Everything Marvel has to offer is brought on the table by this film
1561,This movie is so amazing I can't even begin to explain how great the acting and the emotions are in it. And I won't because this is a movie you need to go to cinema and see for yourself. RD Jr deserves so much praise for this role in this movie and so does Karen Gillan who just rocked. If you haven't had a chance yet please go and see this movie. It's a brilliant ending to 22 movies
1562,"Just a superb example of beautiful story telling![換行字元][換行字元]3 hrs passes in the blink of an eye, although you come out feeling like you have been put through an emotion wringer. Incredibly well done, even down to the appropriate, satisfying but not ""happy"" ending...[換行字元][換行字元]Just see it - no - just see ALL of the MCU movies :-)"
1563,This film has practically no story.[換行字元][換行字元]It is just Marvel throwing everything at us hoping to justify its budget with drawing all sorts of fanboys and of course they succeeded. The part where Thor drinks earth beer and belches is so stupid.[換行字元][換行字元]Fin.
1564,Perfection! one of the best movies I've ever seen and I can't imagine an amazing ending like that
1565,"I'm gonna get burnt for this but it's just okay enough for me. Believe me, I was extremely excited before stepping in the cinema because of how great Infinity War was and considering how the Russo brothers stepped up recent Marvel movies.[換行字元][換行字元]Unfortunately, I was left with somewhat disappointment. It's not bad but It's not great either. First half of the movie is your standard Marvel comedy with some interesting and emotional twists. I really liked how they brought all these characters together through unexpected incidents. I also really loved some changes to some characters as well as to how suitable the changes were and they felt real. However, the last half was the part where I wasn't really into. They reignited the old formula from Infinity War to some extend and it felt familiar yet not impressive or fresh. Sure, some twists toward the end are quite nice, specifically one about a certain character (no spoilers) were absolutely astonishing. Other than that, nothing else really caught my full attention[換行字元][換行字元]Expect fun and fights obviously, a lot of them will be waiting for you. However, personally this is a weaker work of the Russo brothers. Even if they managed to capture audience' applause with the fight scenes as the cinema I went to exploded literally when the fights came onto the screen. It's good in its own way and the majority wants something entertaining and yes, they will have it. Nevertheless, I wasn't that amazed by the end. Dare I say Infinity War is much better than Endgame with a more impactful choreography, character developments and ending.[換行字元][換行字元]It's my opinion only and please, enjoy the movie as you like. You'll have fun with it. It may be the last Avengers and it certainly goes out with a bang, that I can guarantee."
1566,"It's not perfect but in this conclusion of this universe, a great way to go out."
1567,"All those who give good rating for this movie are school children and paid reviewers. The whole story are insensible, predictable and too shallow. At the beginning, they (remaining of avengers) easily chop thanos hand and behead him afterward. But at the final battle, they are too soft and then beaten by the purple guy. And then came a red girl (wanda) who almost kill thanos easily. To make it worst, how could cap. Marvel make it too difficult to hold thanos' fingers with both her hands? This doesnt make sense. Some other incident also plague the movie, such as, there would be two zamora after hulk use the stones; where is captain marvel in the story? The writer seems to be unconfident and has no idea how to fit her in the story; dr. Strange come only to play with water; they want to end iron man career coz r. Downey has getting too old for the franchise. Infinity has been much better than endgame. Etc... Endgame is a total flop which best suit for a noob."
1568,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 Brilliant movie
1569,"I'm highly disappointed about end of the saga. This movie and infinity war you can't conmpare them . I really like infinity war, but 3 hours of mess right now . you probably watch the movie but you should make your expectings very very less."
1570,"It's taken eleven years and twenty-two films, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has finally reached its long-awaited bittersweet conclusion.[換行字元][換行字元]Thanos has snapped his fingers and half of all life on Earth is gone. With the few remaining heroes left, the Avengers embark on a revenge quest against the villain that has stolen their friends and loved ones. But just like all plans, this one doesn't go right and the team must now band together for one final showdown in order save the universe and set things right once and for all.[換行字元][換行字元]*Forewarning, this review may a bit shallow at times and free of specific details for the sake of not wanting to give away spoilers. So please give me the benefit of the doubt as I try to be careful with my words.[換行字元][換行字元]After now four outings, brothers Anthony and Joe Russo have firmly planted their position as the MCU's best directors.[換行字元][換行字元]Whether it be during somber conversations between characters or in the Lord of the Rings style final battle, the amount of detail and effort that goes into each frame is unparalleled by any other blockbuster.[換行字元][換行字元]Regular Marvel cinematographer Trent Opaloch's compositional lighting and camera movement is simply outstanding and keeps the film running on all cylinders throughout its three-hour runtime.[換行字元][換行字元]Also keeping the energy high is the lightning pace that brothers infuse into the film's second and third act. They may miss the mark a bit during the first hour, but they more than makeup for it in the latter two thirds as they deliver some of the most entertaining material put to screen.[換行字元][換行字元]Lastly, aiding the brothers is a sweeping score by the always underappreciated Alan Silvestri. His music is swiftly able to go from epic to intimate in the blink of an eye and is a key driver behind many of overwhelming emotions felt.[換行字元][換行字元]Co-written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, ""Avengers: Endgame"" may mark the first film in the franchise to look back in the past as opposed to solely setting up the future.[換行字元][換行字元]The specific medium it uses to reminisce may not be the most logical or neat, but the end product is a string of touching moments that pleasantly rewards fans that have stuck around all these years.[換行字元][換行字元]After some time away from each other during Phase Three, the main core of the Avengers is finally back together, albeit under less than ideal circumstances. This initial tighter cast allows the main troupe to get their time to shine in what could be a few send-off performances.[換行字元][換行字元]Things do start to get messy when the entire roster is put back together. Some characters get the shorter end of the stick in terms of screentime, but I don't know how it could all be properly done unless this movie was another six hours longer (which I would still approve of).[換行字元][換行字元]Marvel films have been built since day one on their ability to blend comedy with high emotional stakes. The stakes have never been higher here, and the same can go for the number of quippy jokes. The quality of the humor is surprisingly high throughout, but the sheer amount of one-liners during what should be tense moments verges on borderline overkill.[換行字元][換行字元]With its bafflingly long cast list, ""Endgame"" boasts quite a few key acting highlights.[換行字元][換行字元]The co-leads of Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans shine brighter than they ever have before. They've gotten better with each performance and leave it all on the screen as they share immense chemistry with each other and everyone around them.[換行字元][換行字元]Josh Brolin is still great as Thanos. While he doesn't reach the high bar he set for himself in Infinity War, he still delivers another powerful performance that towers over all the other Marvel villains.[換行字元][換行字元]Both Karen Gillan and Paul Rudd surprisingly stand out as Nebula and Ant-Man, respectively. They each have a more grounded personal story that offers a stark contrast to the epic main narrative.[換行字元][換行字元]I realize I'm leaving a lot of great performances on the cutting room floor, but it would take a novel to talk about them all. Basically, everyone either did well or just alright. Nobody was outright bad.[換行字元][換行字元]Arguably the biggest pop culture moment of all time, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a film that arrived with an infinite amount of expectations and meets each and every one of them.[換行字元][換行字元]Within its 181-minute runtime, you'll laugh, you'll more than likely cry (I did), and most importantly, be amazed at how a legendary neverending franchise can reach such a satisfying conclusion that both respects the past and gives confidence for the future."
1571,"Amazing movie, satisfies every question possible! It made me cry 😥😥 10/10"
1572,An art of an masterpiece taking 12 years of hard work and determination for a mich deserved acclaim
1573,Everything I expected and more! Wonderful balance between humour and heartbreak! Absolute masterpiece!!
1574,"One of, if not the best movie in the MCU. Despite being 3 hours long, it never felt that long at all and was a blast to watch. Fans will definitely get what they wanted out of it, along with one hell of a ending fight scene. It's something you have to go back and re-watch so you can see what all is going on in the background."
1575,"I rated this an 8 before due to a plot hole but I came to a sudden realization that in actuality THIS really was the 1 out of 14 million realities where they win.[換行字元][換行字元]Captain Marvel CAN'T wield the infinity stones. She's human and her powers were given to her not a part of her.[換行字元][換行字元]Whilst Tony has his arc reactor which can hold the infinity stones and his arc reactor, whilst removable, is a part of him. The arc reactor could be capable of containing the energies of the infinity stones if only for a brief moment.[換行字元][換行字元]And Hulk was already beat up from the first usage. And it's unknown if Thor could handle the infinity stones. Hulk could handle it because of the gamma thing they explained. Thor is weaker than Thanos anyways so maybe he'd die.[換行字元][換行字元]Good god, this movie is pretty well thought out....[換行字元][換行字元]Tony HAD to die. It was the only way.[換行字元][換行字元]Love you 3000."
1576,"Other than wanting to be so politically correct the movie was very good to say the least. If Brie Larson's cold heart melted up in the movie, it would've been even better, but nah, it almost compeltely ruined the whole experience for me. It was a very poor choice when they casted her as Cpt Marvel. She's even got the ""I'd like to speak to your manager"" haircut now, so watching her being arrogant af, looking down on evrybody in the movie triggered me even more"""
1577,"It is good for Marvel fans, but not everyone. People wanna see some real movies,don't try this."
1578,"I was shocked, I seriously expected the worst for this movie and even held off watching it for ages after it came out because people just said it was so poorly done but in reality it was quite spectacular, for me anyway. I'm content with how this movie went and ended."
1579,So for the longest time my two favourite movies were Empire Strikes Back and Jurassic Park......Well times change because its now Empire Strikes Back and Avengers Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie was perfect that's all I can say there is absolutely no flaws a perfect way to end an era of MCU..[換行字元][換行字元]10/10 a flawless movie and now my second favourite movie of all time..... Perfect. #MCU #avengersendgame
1580,"Truly epic,emotional and heartbreaking finale💔 The end of an era😣 Remarkable journey of 11 years and 23 movies comes to an end. Endgame offers the ultimate fangasm you wish for and is insanely awesome. 3rd act is simply electrifying. Pure Marvelgasm.[換行字元][換行字元]Tnku for being a part of our lives🙌 Luv u 3000♥"
1581,"They fit their SJW bs in it, covered all angles especially feminism. Gave a predictable storyline, with some necessary endings for good measure. Could've easily cut off over an hour of useless scenes.[換行字元][換行字元]It really wasn't anything special, at all."
1582,"I'm not going to go in to loads of detail as even the smallest bit can spoil the film but as a massive Marvel fan I thought it was absolutely amazing! The range of emotions I felt was unbelievable. There's loads of reviews by people saying they felt disappointed. I don't know how? All I'm going to say is ""I love you 3000"""
1583,There is no way to describe how amazing this film is!! All you can do is watch this yourself and experience this massive epic !
1584,"Started dark but really brought the story together, worth the wait but now we feel empty that the series is over!"
1585,"No spoilers! Totally have to go see it. You will laugh, cry, be amazed, scared, and feel fulfilled. Really is three hours long, but well worth it."
1586,"This being the 22nd movie of the infinity saga gives an truly deserving end to each and every thing that started with Iron Man(2008). The portrayal of the characters is just magnificent, the CGI, VFX , The background music does complete justice to the requirement of the movie. Directors(Anthony & Joe Russo) have also given their level best performance. Each & every actor brings out the emotions so beautifully which makes this movie a complete package."
1587,Watched midnight show here in Dubai.. Seriously the movie sucks big time.. I didnt like a bit.
1588,El final es pésimo y pareciera que cortaron partes para llegar al final.
1589,"This film is the finale of the Infinity Saga, and it is one of the best movies ever. It pays tribute to all the other films, while having a good story, great characters, great dialogue, and is the epic conclusion we all need. 10/10"
1590,"This movie is ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. If you know the cosinus wave, that is feeling of the film !!! You got emotional, then JOKE, emotional again. And this is like you're watching 2-3 series in the one time. any expectation on your head is really nothing. Amazingggggg. immensely satisfying payoff"
1591,"The great thing about the Avengers-Franchise has always been this winning scheme:[換行字元][換行字元]1. A range of very different characters like Thor, Spidey and Strange, clashing together in witty and funny dialogues that showcases just how different they are. Spidey cracking jokes about deep philosophic insights of Strange, while Thor asks about beer.[換行字元][換行字元]2. Incredible fight scenes[換行字元][換行字元]3. Both may be linked by a variety of different narrative elements, from film-noir/detective over comedy to splatter.[換行字元][換行字元]It's an easy base recipe, that may be filled with any narrative strings, so long as they are intriguing.[換行字元][換行字元]Problem with the Avengers movies and the finale in particular is:[換行字元][換行字元]The winning scheme is NOT used and the narrative underlying is poor, at best.[換行字元][換行字元]They picked parts of a variety of comics (like the ""Thor get's irresponsible and fat""-plot), which is ok and linked them very poorly together. It's a series of short plots, loosely tied together with no red line (other than ""Thanos is the Endboss"").[換行字元][換行字元]Secondly, the acting is poor, apart from Iron Man of course! Even Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johanssen do a really bad job at depicting their character. The digitally animated raccoon is a highlight in terms of acting.[換行字元][換行字元]There is only ONE AVENGER-TYPICAL FIGHTSCENE, which is great, but does not make up for the rest.[換行字元][換行字元]Foot-Note: As a Non-American, the Glory-Halleluja-Murica focus on Cap is too much. If you're patriotic enough, you'll love it, of course."
1592,"I won't include any spoliers in this review.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is good and worth the six bucks I paid to see it. To be honest, there were a ton of super heroes in it that I could not even identify. And I'm pretty sure a couple of actors who come up in the end credits weren't even this movie at all![換行字元][換行字元]For the most part, the movie keeps your attention with pretty much non-stop action and a decent storyline that follows up on the half-end of Earth ending from the last installment. It's a BIG movie with huge special effects and I imagine the entire roster of Marvel characters.[換行字元][換行字元]For me, the Black Panter group appearance was rather unintentionally laughable. I think it's the wakest of all Marvel super heros. And that brings up another point -- when all the super heroes work together you realize how dumb some of their super powers are.[換行字元][換行字元]There were not as many off hand comic remarks as seen in previous Marvel movies and I think that was to the detrement of the film. The new Thor is pretty funny, however.[換行字元][換行字元]As you might expect, the finale is a really big one and all the big guns are brought out for the ending. And when it's all done, you have to sit through a rather unnecessessary 30 minute coda. It reminded me of the third Lord of the Rings installment that just kept ending as well.[換行字元][換行字元]So the net net is, the movie is good, not great and a half hour can easily have been cut without a problem."
1593,"Does Endgame live up to the hype as the continuation of Infinity War and the MCU[換行字元][換行字元]Yes, Yes it does!"
1594,One of the best ending no doubt[換行字元][換行字元]We are all satisfied 😍
1595,Best Hero Movie in the world From star to end everything is fine and this rate is true for this movie
1596,"Wooowwieeee![換行字元][換行字元]Jesus, after years of storytelling, World building, comic book mayhem, this chapter has finally come to an end.[換行字元][換行字元]And Goddamn, what a conclusion.[換行字元][換行字元]This is the best Marvel film. This is just 'it' everything about it was incredible. Yes you can argue its absurd, crazy, bonkers and very long. But damn, as a movie goer I was solidly entertained and enjoyed every moment of the film.[換行字元][換行字元]Honestly worth it. Absolutely worth it. Just go see it."
1597,Bring tissues because it laughs make you ugly cry 😭
1598,"I don't mind long movies, but they should be interesting. The story of this one could have been written by any 10 year old. What are story-writers getting paid for these days?"
1599,I can't believe I wasted 3 hours of my life on this movie
1600,"More than 10 years we have seen awesome movies, of course it has to end, and marvel give us the best way. The movie got everything laughs, jokes, sad parts. Just amazing, please give the Oscar to this movie."
1601,"Show some respect, I mean the movie is the best of its generation 3000 times. Why do people give it down ratings?!! This movie deserves the most 3000 more than you do."
1602,How this movie collecting from every movie from marvel is incredible.
1603,"After Infinity war I had very high expectations, and boy I was wrong.[換行字元][換行字元]Don't get me wrong, the movie is 'watchable' but far on quality and energy from the previous one.[換行字元][換行字元]P.S - if you are hulk fan (like me!) get ready to be disappointed even more. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie."
1604,One of the most awaited movie is finally here and it lives uoto the expectations and does not disappoint at all
1605,"If you are fan, it is 9/10, if you like suc movies 8/10, if you watch it just spend sometime with friends etc. it is 7/10. Relatively not much action comparer to previous one, more story."
1606,"Disney's grand attempt cash grab, trying to kill off characters while pandering to fan theories on who should live. Movie doesn't deserve a high rating because it is not theatrically complex. Time travel is a terrible cop-out for a real plot device."
1607,"Okay, I guess I have to say something now. Avengers Endgame! First of all, thank you so much to the whole team for everything![換行字元][換行字元]I saw Avengers Endgame twice this week. And there is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]While I was watching Avengers Endgame, the crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to applaud at the end of the movie. And so did I. I cried 5 times during the movie. Not just me, everyone was crying in the theater. So I'm fully on my emotion, there was so many tears of joy and lost. I know it's a superhero movie but it left me speechless.[換行字元][換行字元]3 hours well used. It was a perfect ending of the Avenger Movies. So, I can't dispute its great conclusion. It's definitely one of the best Marvel films.[換行字元][換行字元]OMG! I laughed, cried and was speechless. I'm gonna miss this team. I love you 3000."
1608,This was a really well made finale for the avengers franchise. They did an amazing job finishing it. The actors did a wonderful job as their characters. There were good ideas going on in this movie. It kept me interested throughout its long runtime. The actors fit into their roles perfectly. The action is excellent. The soundtrack is awesome. The humour in the film was brilliant. The emotional parts of the film were really well done. I cried a couple of times during the film. The ending was satisfying. This is a movie that you should experience. Lots of praise to the people who made this great movie.
1609,"Avengers: Endgame did the un-thinkable, it was a thrilling conclusion to 2018's ""Avengers: Infinity War"", and concluded the character arches to Marvel favorites, Iron Man, Captain America, and Black Widow. The M.C.U (Marvel Cinematic Universe) started in 2008 with Robert Downey Jr. starting in the title role of ""Iron Man"" and 22 films later and over a decade of time has changed both Hollywood and audience's expectations forever. The film directed by Joe and Anthony Russo tells an exciting and emotional story that also gives Marvel fans exactly what they would want with multiple fanboy/girl moments and Easter eggs throughout. The film works on so many levels, but the highlight is the emotional impact the concluding arches of these characters. With so many films for fans to get-to-know, and understand these characters, it almost feels like watching one's best friend or family member go through the on-screen drama that unfolds. This may not be the end of the M.C.U., but it is the end of a very special era for comic book and movie fans."
1610,"Infinity loop. Now back to the past. Its the same. Too much emotional. Too much patriarcal. The women are atrezzo, they only stay in a second plane. Captain Marvel just talk two times. WTF! Disappointing. Meh."
1611,What a great movie!! You know nothing until the end! Such a masterpiece!!
1612,This is everything I needed from Endgame.a Lot of people who only watched it for the hype won't be able to enjoy the movie as much as we Marvel do. It gave the characters the ending they deserved and oh my God that last fight scene is a freaking masterpiece. I don't think any movie will ever make me feel the way I felt while watching Endgame in a decade.
1613,"Let's start with this, the plot has little flaws or plot holes here and there. And if you didn't watch a whole lot of other previous MCU films. Maybe this is not for you.[換行字元][換行字元]For me, who watched every MCU movies ever produced. This one has it all. A new take on hero movie, part of it like mission impossible. Very well thought out story. A hidden layer of means. Take its time to resolve many things, not rushing it.[換行字元][換行字元]If Ironman I is a 10, this one is a 11."
1614,Poor dubbing by Tamil.. horrible to see the movie... Could have been better.. Worst dubbing... Mismatch totally... everyone laughs for a serious scenes....
1615,"The movie is incredible. Wraps so much up. Creates a satisfying and perfect conclusion to the MCU until now. For me this is where I stop, and this film easily surpassed Infinity War. Thank you Marvel, for this amazing experience."
1616,"Each and every character of this movie has given their contributions to the fullest that makes this movie fantastic. The credits of end game has been given to each and every characters who have been the part of the jounrey with their tireless efforts and hardwork. The screenplay of the movie is the most attracted part that enabled audience driven to this movie . This movie consists emotions that made us cry, laugh and given a wonderful experience to all the cinema lovers. Each and every dialogues made us cry and laugh that was the huge part of the movie driven the End game to success. There could be an end to the marvel universe but there is no end to love of the millions and billions of fans of marvel universe . Thank you marvel 💪"
1617,"LITERALLY , one of the best movies i have seen in my entire life , filled with a tone of action and emotions . you will love avenger endgame . ' i love you 3000 '"
1618,"Fight scenes weren't satisfactory enough, it should included more epic clashes. Didn't like the new Hulk. Dr Strange didn't show up much"
1619,"I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies. I will watch it again and again and again. 10 points well deserved!!!"
1620,"What can I say, truely a masterpiece of a genre that has been here for years and nobody could extract the emotions which the Marvel guys were able to, be it Iron Man, Avengers or any movie from the Marvel vault. It was just a emotional ride where you are actually going back in time yourself in between 10 years of your own life. At the end, it's not about the money it makes, it's all about the people it has brought together from different worlds altogether. A must watch (thrice at least)."
1621,"All in all it's a fine movie. Naturally if you haven't seen the previous few Avengers there's no reason for you to watch this, but as far as critiquing movies this movie has few flaws. It's a good movie with no controversial topics that all members of the family would enjoy. The main point against this movie is the ridiculous run-time of 3 hours."
1622,"Mediocre in the extreme for easily pleased geeks who have zero appreciation of real cinema Too many characters, poor script and cringe worthy dialogue all add up to making a predictable mess of a movie."
1623,"Went to see this today. Absolutely loved it one of the best Avengers movies by far. Great acting, awesome CGI and of an awesome cast. Trust me when I say go and see this film it is an out of this world adventure! This movie has everything so, you might want to see this movie as it didn't disappoint Avengers: Endgame IS the film to see an absolute awesome way to end the Marvel Avengers series go see it now you don't want to miss it trust me."
1624,"People have no idea how to review things anymore,they all just put 10/10 because of hype and this is the last of the series..No this movie is the best thing of all time,its NOT a perfect work of art nor masterpiece,in fact its very poorly done and had a pathetic ending. I real waste of my money and time. Things all started going downhill after Infinity War..Thor is a one big giant joke,hes not godly,epic,interesting or manly anymore hes just a big man child. Hulk was always a bit more comical which is fine but now its on this whole new level of stupidity. Ironman is the only one with any character left and yet even Robert Downey Jr has to suffer when pitted against such terrible writing. Things just happen that dont make sense, characters suddenly become moronic and the entire build up of epic moments is taken down into this ultra cringe scene that ruins the whole plot.[換行字元][換行字元]The constant misplaced child humor and the attempts to make ever little scene into a Disney baby movie is sickening. Things can't be taken seriously anymore or its too offensive,everything needs to be dumbed down into this childish mush so the general public can clap their hands and drool. I'm really glad this series is over with before they burn it into the ground more..Yet i cant help but think about all the other comics that will be ruined with this writing style..[換行字元][換行字元]Are IQs really so low now that this is what counts as a ""good"" movie?!"
1625,"This was the average superhero movie with an ending everyone expected,its a shame they did this to the best villain ever thanos"
1626,Drama 4/5 Action 5/5 Vfx cgi 5/5 Humour 3.5/5 Suspens 3/5
1627,"Hello again everyone! It's been almost a month since thousands of Marvel fans (including myself) got to see the one and only Endgame for the very first time, without having a clue of what could possibly happen. And as with most of the people who already watched it...there are no words to describe how this amazingly crafted piece of superhero movie-making just...blew me away.[換行字元][換行字元]I will start by giving its credit to the acting work of everyone. When we appreciate that, we can see that this isn't just another sci-fi flick where no one does exactly a great effort to make a remarkable performance. No. This is a movie that presents us a group of heroes that, after long years of saving the earth from any menace, are giving the last of themselves in order to give the planet one last shot. The performances made it all seem authentic and real.[換行字元][換行字元]Now, the story. God. The story is many things. Sometimes it's funny, as any other of the previous movies from the MCU. But also it's deep, melancholic, tragic, and most of all, undeniably exciting.[換行字元][換行字元]10/10. Probably most of the people that will read this had already watched it. But in case you haven't, you really, REALLY ought to do so. Probably during quite a few years, there will be no other film of the genre that can possibly make you feel all of the emotions that Avengers Endgame made the audiences feel, and made me feel. Don't miss it for anything[換行字元][換行字元]Peace!"
1628,"You can't ask more than this from the makers of movies like these...... Just remember, they have given you a memorable gift which will stay with you forever! And this indeed makes the movie itself and you a special entity! Avengers Infinity War & Endgame....A movie which is making/has made a class of it's own!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
1629,"Best send off ever. Just awesome. Loved it!. Too many previous movies references which was really great. Great story, direction, cinematography, vfx and everything."
1630,"Overall I really liked the movie but infinity war was more on the ""style"" of the other avengers movies. Even tho there had been some scenes where I found myself bored from the story, what made me enjoy the movie was the scene of the final battle and more particularly its end"
1631,So unfair to the Thor's character. I felt the character was totally treated bad. Even the Hulk's character was wasted.
1632,"I have never written a review on IMDb before, but I feel that this movie is deserving of my first one. The critics said you would both laugh and cry throughout the movie, and I can confirm that to be true. Despite the serious nature of the plot, there were so many humourous moments for the fans which really lightened the mood.[換行字元][換行字元]It really is a film made for the fans, with so many references only true fans of Marvel would fully appreciate. I absolutely loved all those little touches, it made me feel like I've been part of something.[換行字元][換行字元]The ending was very bitter sweet, but it gave the audience closure on many of the main characters in different ways. Safe to say there wasn't a dry eye in the cinema![換行字元][換行字元]Absolutely fantastic film, it completely surpassed all of my expectations. Well done to the Russo brothers and all the cast/crew."
1633,This movie follows the other movies in the past of Marvel studios however Infinity WAr was better and has more well made story than this. despite my feelings the movie is good but not perfect by the way the movie shows at first the heroes broken to finally solved their problems
1634,"What can I say, there was no film this year that i was more excited about. The first two/two and half hours were perfection. I loved so many things but once it was over i felt a bit underwhelmed. It might have been due to the hype or my anticipation but i was left unsatisfied.[換行字元][換行字元]It is also difficult to talk about this film without spoilers but Thor and Hulk were incredible and most definitely added to the comedy.[換行字元][換行字元]RDjr and Chris Evans bring their A game and their performances are great![換行字元][換行字元]Don't walk into it hoping to see your favourite villain Thanos as he is sidelined for the majority of the picture. I don't see this as a negative though as this film is about the Avengers.[換行字元][換行字元]Most will love the hell out of this film and i will certainly be seeing it again soon, but for the now, i'm not too sure how i feel about it."
1635,"Walking in, given Marvel's latest publicity, I was expecting, well, I was expecting an absolute cringe fest, and thankfully I didn't get it. In fact, there were only a couple of absolute cringe moments and each dealt with Brie Larson, particularly her appearance in the final fight.[換行字元][換行字元]Thankfully though, Marvel showed a lot of restraint with that and as a result the movie really belonged to the characters that we all have invested over a decade of love and loyalty in....and honestly that was a relief. There were times where the film looked like it wanted to go the other way, and put the OG Avengers in the backseat. So, credit for not doing that.[換行字元][換行字元]It feels a lot more like Kill Bill 2 in atmosphere than a real Super-Hero movie, all the really fun big fights were reserved for the first film and what's left is a long closing act that is more concerned with tying up loose ends than delivering on over-the-top action. And it works for a send off film after a decade of investment.[換行字元][換行字元]So what you have feels very much like an intimate and sentimental film made by old friends at send off...or a funeral...but in either case it is absolutely appropriate.[換行字元][換行字元]Unfortunately, you have the enormously epic CGI battle at the end and I, for one, am kind of done with that trope. It's starting to bore me now, and, honestly, I would prefer something a little more authentic. But, that being said, the film at least called for it.[換行字元][換行字元]We've seen battles like that before, Black Panther, Aquaman, Infinity War, Lord of the Rings, and, honestly those CGI armies lack any real intimacy. So the end is kind of a bore compared to the rest of the film.[換行字元][換行字元]The highlight in the film would be Thor with Hulk coming in as a close second. They steal the show from the moment they are introduced and the trademark MCU humor that Black Panther and Captain Marvel utterly lacked. And the humor was a source of comfort after two films that made vague threats of taking themselves far too seriously for a superhero flick.[換行字元][換行字元]The wrap-up was more than satisfying if not heart-wrenching at moments making it a great send off for a decade of time and money invested in the characters, however the legacy that the MCU is passing on seems in trouble nonetheless and we can only hope that it doesn't go the route that the MCU has been teasing and toying with and continues to deliver fun superhero movies and not the heavy-handed or deadly serious films they have threatened the audience with."
1636,"Pros + Incredible performances from the Original 6 Avengers + Strong Emotional Impact + Unexpected Surprises + Incredible Direction from the Russo Brothers (Seriously, hats off to these guys who did the impossible) + Solid Humor + Strong Pacing (except the 1st Act which at some times is a bit slow) + Cinematography (Lots of Great Shots that I want to frame them on my wall) + Sound Effects & Mixing + Alan Silvestri's Best Score + Easter Eggs & References from previous MCU movies + The Entire 3rd Act + Strong Rewatchability + Taking Risks on its characters, that ultimately works + Amazing payoff for the characters and this universe[換行字元][換行字元]Cons[換行字元]A Plot Element that set up its rules, but kinda broke them especially in the end.

This is a thank you letter for the fans who stuck with this franchise for 10+ years and this is their reward. Highly recommend watching more than once because it gets better each viewing.[換行字元][換行字元]My score : 9.2/10"
1637,"A spectacular culmination that is in many ways better than previous instalments. Endgame can be surprising, nostalgic, touching, there's better character development, it's not afraid to be self-ironic and changes style and pace. The first third is rather intimate, the second is more relaxed and the finale is grandiose action inferno. However, all these parts fit together pretty nicely. Sure, there are weaker moments and many things can be justifiably criticized (fan-service, plot holes, sometimes slow pacing etc.) But those are just small (and expected) negatives when compared to the huge scope of Marvel's cinematic universe that was build up over entire decade.[換行字元][換行字元]My hat's off to you, Marvel, you're an indisputable pop-culture phenomenon."
1638,"I think the storyline is great, really enjoyed it and it's really quite unpredictable. The scenes were really heart-warming but I had one serious issue with the character development and power scaling. That didn't allow me to enjoy the movie fully and when it ended I didn't get the very satisfied feeling which I had from Infinity wars."
1639,Fitting end to such a legendary saga. Dont see how this can ever be topped.
1640,"If you've watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in '08. The fate of him as well as Captain America and a few others were great epilogues for them. Oh, and one final cameo by Marvel Comics' late creator of many of the company's popular superheroes-Stan Lee-makes it even more poignant. So to quote him, ""Excelsior!"""
1641,"I was so excited for this movie just like so many others, but I was seriously underwhelmed throughout. People said there was a single 4 minute lull in the middle of the movie, however, it felt like a good majority of the movie was nothing but lulls and filler. I really hoped for this movie to be so good, but by the end I was left scratching my head. It was so disappointing, especially for a Marvel movie, and I felt very let down by the series that I've grown up with. There are many unresolved plot holes throughout the whole movie that leaves me wondering how it made it to production with plot holes and mistakes this bad. I believe there was lots of lousy, careless writing and production on account of the production team resting on their laurels of being Marvel and the hype of the movie. On top of all these mistakes, there were definitely points of politicizing gender bias at points where it didn't make sense to put it. Honestly, that was totally unnecessary and highly detracting from the already poorly made movie. I was also disappointed by the use, or better stated misuse, of characters, such as Captain Marvel. For all the hype that was brought up about her, I misunderstood all of it. I never saw her movie, and told it was unnecessary for the avengers timeline. After watching, it was correct. She was used in only two points as a deus ex machina and nothing else. Using a character, especially as powerful as she was for nothing but a deus ex machina is a very amateurish level of writing. It could've been so much better for an ending to the MCU story, but I was so let dow and keep wishing it were better."
1642,"I'm big fan of marvel, and I see all movie comics books and this is a best movie in the world not only comics , in all movies."
1643,"Marvel Studios' 'Avengers: Endgame' is the end of a journey 11 years and 21 films in the making. This journey began in 2008's 'Iron Man', the film that launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and every Marvel Studios film since then has led us here. I assure you though, 'Endgame' is the PERFECT ending to the 'Infinity Saga', as it's been dubbed. The film revolves around the remaining Avengers trying to undo the catastrophic loss of life brought on by Thanos in last year's 'Avengers: Infinity War'. Eventually, with the help of Scott Lang/Ant-Man, they discover a way to go back in time via the microscopic Quantum Realm and try to steal the 6 Infinity Stones and bring back all the lives that were lost. The film's runtime is a little over 3 hours, but that's because there's a LOT of story to tell, and not a SECOND of it feels slow or unnecessary. From the opening scene, 'Endgame' grabs your attention with the force of the Infinity Gauntlet and refuses to let go! The film's directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, manage to juggle a vast amount of main characters and story threads BRILLIANTLY, without ever making the story feel boring or rushed. Everything flows PERFECTLY from one scene to the next, and (at least in my opinion) never gets confusing or hard to follow. Well, there actually is ONE scene where Bruce Banner explains how time-travel works in the MCU, and I didn't really understand it, but it's time-travel so no one knows FOR SURE how it actually works. Other than that, I understood everything just fine. Now, onto the acting. 'Endgame' features some of the BEST acting performances I've EVER seen in a Marvel movie, from Chris Evans (Steve Rogers/ Captain America), Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow), Jeremy Renner (Clint Barton/Hawkeye), Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Holland (Peter Parker/Spider-Man), but the standout performance is definitely, without a doubt given by Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man). I'm not kidding when I say RDJ deserves an Oscar for his performance. The film also has THE BEST third act in the HISTORY of comic book movies. It's nothing short of ASTONISHING how they were able to pull that off, but they did, and it was the greatest thing my eyeballs have ever witnessed. There's a very emotional scene towards the end of the movie where, for the first time in my 20 years of life, I FULL-ON ugly-cried watching it. It was bad. I pretty much cried from that scene until the end of the movie, so I HIGHLY recommend you bring tissues. Maybe an adult diaper too, because you are NOT gonna wanna get up to pee. So, to wrap this up, 'Endgame' is more than just a movie. It's the cinematic event of a lifetime, the likes of which I doubt we'll see again for a VERY long time. It's a love-letter to Marvel fans who have been on this journey for the past 11 years, and it's everything I ever wanted it to be. I know I said this last year about 'Infinity War', but THIS time I'll emphasize it more: 'Avengers: Endgame' is the GREATEST comic book movie of ALL-TIME."
1644,"People say this movie is the end of an era! That may be true for some, but if Marvel continues down this path for these movies, I'll be watching every movie until the day I die! Such a perfect stepping stone for the past 10 years of movies. This movie hit me differently than I ever thought imaginable. Definitely a must-see if you're into action movies."
1645,"I created this account only to give this movie a 1, or ""I give this a 5 rating but am voting it a 1 just to lower the undeserved high rating"", and of course all the comedians and trolls and the holier than thou of moviedom that give various reasons for trying to adjust this movie's merits, or lack thereof. These are the kind of disappointing reviews I am writing about. Stop adjusting and come to the realization that you didn't get what you wanted from it. Others did.[換行字元][換行字元]Here's what I think. There was a good mix of action and dialogue. You know, dialogue, the part that tells the story? The CG and non-CG special effects worked for me. The story was a little weak. Time travel is a subject that is still fiction, so I feel no need to try and pick apart the theoretical inconsistencies. Some make the comment that there was too much going on in trying to bring the whole MCU into this movie and that the idea may have been a bad one. Now this is the kind of comment that is useful in a review. I won't say more, since just about anything else could be a spoiler. It was a good 6 out of 10, so I am giving it a 6."
1646,"I saw a many houndred of movies in my life. And there are a lot of them, they were really brilliant.

1647,No nooo nooo just nooo :) just nooooo :) this is the movie i was waiting for 4 month???? Noooo just noooooo worst movie ever !!! Nooo nooo just nooooooooooo
1648,"A lot in Endgame was great but there were more than a few sub-par moments. There were numerous plotholes, including in relation to the major plot in the middle of the movie, they ruined several of the characters, and the final resolution was lame. And yes, there are about a dozen undeserved ""woke"" moments..."
1649,"I dont know what to say about the movie because if I consider it as the last movie, it might be a better end. however actually it is not an end it was a good opportunity for the desired changeover. and they did this very well. Russo's and Feige did not miss this great opportunity and got the chance to create a newer and more well-balanced cinematic universe. Thank you guys for everything. LOVE YOU"
1650,It's an unforgettabale 3 hour ride of every goddamn emotion..They did the best job summing it all up..COULDN'T HAVE BEEN BETTER!!
1651,"I'd like to start with I'm a great marvel fan and loved infinity war must have watched it about 20 times. Waiting all year for this film was hard and the excitement as I got ready to watch endgame was crazy. As a whole the story was good and we'll set out, but a few things did disappoint me. I'll start with hulk I thought they made is character weak and just not like the hulk we use to, hulk was suppose to be like a wild animal with no control yet in this film he's like the hulk out of a kids cartoon. Thor he played an amazing part in infinity was and at the start of this film he was still the Thor we like, but they turned him into an idiot, I get they wanted us to see all the characters giving up but they made him a joke, I get the film's are not 100% serious but they just destroyed him. There are some very good parts to the film that made me laugh and want to cry but I just don't feel they pulled it off as good as infinity war. Infinity war was amazing one of the best in my eyes and I was really hoping this film would be the same, maybe I need to watch it a few more times to appreciate it more I don't know."
1652,"Tremendous, it never ends and u always hope it's finishing"
1653,"The movie started off really well but somewhere in the middle it just felt rushed. The already long runtime or maybe the fact that it just had too many minds working on it, the world may never know, it could've been better. Infinity war was the second best Marvel movie after Iron Man(the first one) in my opinion and Endgame although it's the end of an era it just felt it was lacking in a lot of places and that void that is left in our hearts by the departure of the Avengers might not yet be filled."
1654,"But I want to try to bring the rating down because it does not deserve to be ranked among such movies as The Godfather and Twelve Angry Men.[換行字元][換行字元]Ill start by saying the movie starts off really strong. Whenever you're dealing with time travel, there's it almost always going to end up messy. There's about a 45 minute stretch in here where the film isn't really coherent, and the way they choose to cover that is by distracting us with a humor, literally a joke every 10 seconds. After a certain point, the movie gets a lot better during the second half.[換行字元][換行字元]Not as good or as tightly written as infinity war. I think everyone is raving over this movie because it's the end of the marvel franchise, and they did a good job at wrapping everything up. It is no where near one of the ""best movies of all time"" like everyone is saying."
1655,"I mean this movie was just amazing.... from the deaths the characters endured, and how they persevered to come together and defeat Thanos. 10/10"
1656,"It's just amazing. No other words to be honest. Movie is full of every single emotion, I'm happy that MCU-Avengers ended brilliantly after all these years. Thank you!"
1657,"I'm so speechless for this beautiful wonder in the cinematic universe. So all beeing said ""I can do this all day""."
1658,"Needless to say, it's really perfect for a beautiful ending: *"
1659,What was that. A fat useless thor. Bits of old stuff. An ant. A stupid looking not the hulk.. I give up. That was awful.. All hype. 3 hours of my life I can't get back... You wait it will dawn on you... This was just a bad film.
1660,"A a stand off movie this one would have been a average one time watch with usual super hero stuff. But actually to conclude a franchise of this magnum, this is definitely not the way to do it. Maybe it because the crew and the directors got too much on their plate to handle. Unlike the previous MCU movies this movie took on a near to impossible task of connecting the dots from all the 22 movies and then bring it to a conclusion, which unfortunately just didn't happen. I would say personally as fan this was a great disappointment as none of my favorite characters got enough screen time which they deserve and also it was like a dump yard all those who went missing being dumped in one place and suddenly they do their thing and its all done. Come on man its Tony and the send off is totally not worth it. Thor, maybe in the beginning I found it funny but once the story progress it just didn't go with the kinda of personality as we know. Capt. Marvel do even know why she is in the movie first place, it would've mad no difference even without her. The solution to bring ppl back it just happened over night and it was not convincing at all, except it involved Tony. Same goes with Hulk, happened just like that that. it was just too much mess and they didn't do enough to clean it up. Two parts is seriously inadequate, could've been a trilogy...."
1661,"The movie was exhilarating, super fantastic, stupendous, I liked everything about it. Well done Russo brothers, you'll have ended the saga in a way that's very brilliant yet heart breaking. Phenomenal job, everything was directed in right proportions and where it has to be, full marks to the cast and crew of the movie and everybody else who contributed towards making this movie possible. Worth every minute spent in watching this movie! Thanking the Russo brothers again."
1662,"The build-up to third act was full of pay offs and as a Marvel fan, I did appreciate that, but it did seem to slightly drag on some parts. However, the third act itself was the greatest and most epic movie experience I have ever had."
1663,"The Avengers end with class. I really enjoyed this movie. Endgame is more slow plot than Infinity War, but not that mean this movie is boring. I love how Endgame ended The Avengers. I swear you'll be miss The Avengers"
1664,"When you have an excellent team, from producers, writers, screenwriters and good actors among others, comes the result in which fans come to the heading. I'm not going to talk about the movie or what happens, but one thing I can say is that this movie has to be seen as a whole Infinity War (begin) Endgame (end) two parts of the same story, and all the bows that are closed. Endgame is the end of a chapter and the desire for more, and I have no doubt that the public will complain for more of this Universe (MCU) so well worked, so well imagined, so well achieved.[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]This story is much more than a war of titans, heroes, super villain, is about something much more obvious, tangible.

1667,"Given how many series there have been in the last 20 years or so, and how many of them were able to end their series in a profound way, such sublime conclusions are few and far between. Honestly, I haven't seen a better ending to a series since Return of the King (extended version, of course!), which for me, is the best trilogy of all-time.[換行字元][換行字元]Here, we're dealing with a 22-movie story arc, which plays out almost like a miniseries on Netflix.

What's remarkable is how Marvel/Disney were able to map out this massive story arc so that everything worked cohesively, for the most part.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers Infinity War was very good, but when you add this film to it, it's solid epicness across the board!

I'm sure glad I was wrong![換行字元][換行字元]As with nearly all of the films in the series, there are plenty of tongue-and-cheek moments, serious moments, etc. But this movie probably delved more deeply into the heart than any that came before it.

And the writers gambled (and won!) that they had done a good enough job to get the reactions that they'd hoped for from the audience.[換行字元][換行字元]I'm currently living and working in Taiwan.

And I'm so happy that they did! All series, that are as good as this one has been (for the most part), should have an ending like this one. Except that now, it's like aiming for the moon!"
1668,Good ending . It's a good end for our 10 year best MCU character
1669,"Pure brilliance plain and simple. Ignore the haters and people that have never seen a film that were dragged to the movie theater. This movie was 10 years in the making and is the most powerful, satisfying ending right next to The Lord of the Rings. No one could have predicted this. It was put together in such a detailed way that only the amazing minds of Marvel studios could have done. I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie. Every scene that was put together contributed to amazing story that ultimately led to the endgame. Pardon my french but how in the hell else could it have ended?? These pioneers of a creative team with immense pressure put upon them gave you EVERYTHING you could have wanted in a movie! 3 hours! Thank god for the Marvel Universe, however it will never be the same. Bravo!!"
1670,"That's not fair with Thor and Hulk. They haven't done, what they known for And I dnt knw why Captain Marvel was introduced, she has done nothing in the movie."
1671,"Amazing, 100% the best MCU movie by a country mile. Everything you want plus 1,000,000 extra amazing bits"
1672,"Avengers Endgame is truly one of the best epic films ever made.. This film literally made entire theatre whistle, laugh, cry, sad and shout their lungs out!!! There are few moments which will make every marvel cry, no matter how hard they hold onto...."
1673,I am just speechless at this point. There aren't words available in the dictionary to provide justice to the magnum opus that Avengees Endgame is. Kevin Feige and the Russo brothers have just outdone themselves. You could say that infinity war had some flaws in its narrative context. BUT ENDGAME IS THE PERFECT SUPERHERO MOVIE. One of my most favourite films of all time PERIOD. It manages to live up to the expectations of hardcore fans to the maximum and so much more. General movie going audiences will also enjoy this as it is in many ways its own movie and doesn't depend too much on previous installments. Do yourselves a favour guys and watch it ASAP. TRULY A MASTERPIECE
1674,"Endgame serves to convlude character arcs established throughout the past 11 years in the most perfect way possible. It does everything perfectly without skipping a beat. The humor lands, the drama engrosses you, and the actiom (particularly the third act) is absolutely incredible."
1675,"An absolute love letter to Marvel. If there was a 5 hour cut, I'm down."
1676,"The film starts off in gear 1, and gathers momentum at a steady pace. When it shifts into gear 5... oh wow! The final battle is every marvels fans biggest dream! And then the film ends with a tear jerker. Amazing."
1677,"Horrible, wrapping things up for the sake of wrapping things up. Random stuff thrown together with no meaning or story."
1678,"Endgame is a resounding and epic end to a 10 year journey of Marvel movies. Even though it introduces tons of plot holes and questions that need answering, its character moments are definitely satisfying."
1679,"Because this movie puts everything on its ear. It's a love letter to ten years for all the fans; it's funny, it's sad, it's family, it's sacrifice, it is everything a superhero team film can ever be. There will never EVER be a film like this made ever again. Not this good. Not this memorable. And not this powerful. It is a culmination of many moving parts that finally work as a perfect clock. And it took over a decade to pull it off. You will be moved. You will cheer. And so help you if you don't even tear up. We. ARE. Groot."
1680,"While infinity war left us loads of questions, endgame stay true to its name. We will remember fondly this finale as years go by because of the emotions we invested and reaped."
1681,"To describe it in one word - BORING. No real emotional pull from the vanishing in infinity war and any attempt to, was handled poorly. The opening Hawkeye scene a perfect example The first 45 minutes really plods.The main plot, when we finally get to it, might leave you cringing as will the character assassination of Thor and Hulk - silliness taken a step too far. Some huge inconsistencies in the story too that really irked me, like one throw of the Storm-breaker piercing Thanos despite wearing the gauntlet in infinity, to being powerless to stop him when he is without the gauntlet?!!! And the ending, why didn't they use the time stone to stop the invasion and ensure no avengers die?!!! And how come Hawkeye could handle an infinity stone when it nearly shredded all the guardians in vol 1?!! The end fight scene was boring and poorly choreographed. Overall, I think the russo's ran out of ideas and were overwhelmed with the task of bringing the various storylines and characters together. A shame it ended so shambolically, I had hoped and expected so much more."
1682,Way too long. I found the first 2 hours quite boring. Very disappointed with this film as I did enjoy Infinity War.
1683,"Personally as person who isn't too much into all this comic book stuff, I watched this and it wasn't even mediocre. This was a terrible movie. The drama, characters and action all where really bad. There were still some good scenes in the movie, however over the 3 hour long movie, most of it was terrible. A lot of the acting felt forced, especially with the female superhero actors. There was not a good presentation or an interesting and surprising ending. Not to mention the terrible comedy spread throughout the film. Constantly repeating jokes that were not funny, and lots of references that were rather unfunny and forced.[換行字元][換行字元]This felt like a nerdy fan film sequel to the really good movie, infinity war."
1684,"This movie is all about the love for their characters, especially the original avengers, it created the most epic battle in history not the best but the most epic, this here is the endgame, the best ending I have ever seen for any movie series or tv series, GOT has to top this, an unforgettable experience"
1685,"Great ending to a ten year plan, those three hours go by way to fast and it's hard to believe your in the endgame now."
1686,This was definitely a rollercoaster of emotions. WOW. This movie movie is definitely the best superhero movie ever to be made.
1687,"Epic Finale![換行字元][換行字元]If you just wait for the action scenes, better you watch The Raid, IP-Man or even UFC & WWE Smack Down. HAIL MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE!"
1688,"The length of the movie increased with long talks, which makes almost no contribution to the plot or highlight heroes characters. Instead of Marvel usual excitement feeling (although I am not big fan of comics) you get the feeling was it worth to spend 3h. If the movie would be brutally cut to 1.5 it would be good end product by Marvel."
1689,"Avengers: Endgame Review (11/10)[換行字元][換行字元]I didn't think Marvel would ever be able to top Infinity War, but I was wrong. Marvel delivers a fitting and surprisingly poetic payoff to the Infinity Saga. The less you know going into Avengers: Endgame, the more you're likely to enjoy it. Obviously, you wouldn't have clicked on a review of this movie if you didn't want to know something about the culmination of a decade's worth of Marvel's superhero storytelling, but trust me: more than Avengers: Infinity War, Endgame is truly a story that needs to be experienced. Forget all the external noise from the deliberately vague teaser trailers, perfectly-calibrated celebrity soundbites, and footage leaks, and just strap in for the ride. There's little that can be said about the film without at least alluding to its twists, but what I can say, with certainty, is that Avengers: Endgame is a marvel, both in terms of narrative scale and sheer logistical ambition. The film walks a tightrope between high drama and cathartic comedy, offering some of the darkest and most emotionally honest scenes in the history of the MCU, alongside some of the most ridiculous and sublime. There are fewer laugh-out-loud moments here than in Infinity War, but it's certainly lighter and oftentimes more joyous than you might expect from a story that begins with the fallout from Thanos' snap. Endgame is a film that feels like it was made by fans, for fans - to the point where some scenes will undoubtedly be labeled as outright fanservice. But it's hard to view those moments as cynical pandering so much as earned and effective homages to the moments, characters, and relationships we've grown so invested in over the past 11 years. While Infinity War did its best to juggle an enormous roster of heroes spanning the entirety of the MCU's history, it's no spoiler to say Endgame rightly narrows its focus to the original six Avengers, giving them each a well-deserved moment, or several in the spotlight. The cost of sidelining so many characters is high, but it pays off brilliantly. I know it's not the end of the MCU, but it certainly feels like it. Endgame's greatest accomplishment is how it deepens our understanding and appreciation of the movies that preceded it. This is truly a climax to an entire franchise, not just a resolution to the cliffhanger of Infinity War. This may not have been the only way for Marvel to end the first chapter of its sprawling superhero saga, but when faced with 14,000,605 possible outcomes, it manages to be a surprising and satisfying one."
1690,There are so many plot holes and movie doesn't even try to explain itself. Waste of my time and money.
1691,"Not a good movie, if your a fan of the comics go see John Wick instead, poorly written cash grab,"
1692,"If it were to all end with this one it'd be a perfect way to go. There is surprise at every turn so avoid spoilers at all costs. There really is nothing that can be faulted with this film, from an incredible score which evokes such emotion, to fan service at its finest. If you read the comics as a kid there are some great little treats in it for you too. Prepare for an emotional journey which is definitely worth the 10 year build."
1693,"What a great film, it has everything you want in a film.[換行字元][換行字元]Storyline is great, the CGI parts are crazy good.[換行字元][換行字元]10 out of 10."
1694,"When the first Ironman movie was revealed, I wasn't even an high school student. After 11 years and 22 movies, I will be graduated from university this year. When watching the movie, I was watching all these years. The movie honored all 22 movies in this perfect final. I will be watching next movies till the end. Thanks for this masterpiece..."
1695,"***There will be NO SPOILERS in this review***[換行字元][換行字元]AVENGERS: ENDGAME is an emotionally and artistically satisfying conclusion to 11 years and 22 films of the MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE.[換行字元][換行字元]Closing out ""Phase III"" in the MCU, the concluding chapter for most of the ""original"" MCU characters/actors, ENDGAME picks up the Avengers story right after the conclusion of AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR - a film which saw our heroes lose the battle to Thanos, who snapped his fingers and half the living beings in the Universe vanished.[換行字元][換行字元]Instead of downplaying the grief that a survivor would feel, Directors Joe and Anthony Russo (veterans of many MCU films) wisely decide to ""lean into"" this grief which gives this film something that is surprising for a SuperHero film - emotional resonance. You grieve with these characters that you have come to know - and love - and share their pain and sorrow.[換行字元][換行字元]It's a wise choice for it adds a layer to this film that many Superhero films fail to achieve. Along with action, fun characters that you want to root for, interesting visuals and (are you listening DC?) - HUMOR, this film has ""all the feels"" (to steal a phrase) and will leave the MCU fan (both hardcore and casual) satisfied with the experience.[換行字元][換行字元]Also...interestingly enough...this film stands on it's own quite well. The guy next to me in the theater was a ""newbie"" to the MCU, dragged to the theater with his friends to be ""part of the crowd"" in this experience. Over the first 5 minutes he was asking his buddy a million questions about who is who and what is what...but after that he just settled into his chair and enjoyed the ride for what it is - even jumping up and cheering at a spot late in the film where EVERYONE in the sold out IMAX showing I was in was tempted to jump out of their chair and cheer (yes - there is THAT kind of moment in this film).[換行字元][換行字元]There is also sorrow...loss...joy...relief...tension...excitement...as I said...""all the feels"". I don't usually tear up at movies, but I felt some glistening in the corners of my eyes and a lump in my throat on more than 1 occasion - sometimes with sadness, but, sometimes, with joy and exuberance. Yes! I had tears of JOY jumping out of my eyes at a few moments in this film.[換行字元][換行字元]But, if it is Special Effects spectacle you are looking for - no worries. There are PLENTY including a finale that is worthy of being the Final Battle in the Final Film for this Phase of the series.[換行字元][換行字元]And...the humor...this film has a surprisingly large amount of light, happy moments as well. I give the Russo Brothers - and the MCU - credit for realizing that humor is a good counterbalance to sorrow, action and suspense. I also give them credit for what character they decided to use as the ""comic relief"" in this film. It's a good choice - and the performer tapped to play the humor is equal to the task.[換行字元][換行字元]But, of course, none of this matters if the characters aren't interesting enough to root for - and this film has it in spades. We've watched these characters grow, develop, bond and tear apart over the course of these past 11 years, so there is quite a bit of emotional investment in the characters - and this investment pays of handsomely (again...if you are a ""casual"" fan or a ""newbie"", you'll be fine). But...if you are like me and are ""into"" the MCU then there is payoff after payoff in this film that is extremely satisfying.[換行字元][換行字元]The actors in ENDGAME are, of course, at the top of their game. They know they are capping a special moment in their careers and they ""bring it"". Starting, of course, with Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. His character goes through a wide variety of emotions through the course of this film and - if this is his last MCU film - he's going out in style. As is Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America. These two are at the heart of this film - and at the heart of the MCU - and they take center stage with aplomb, tweaking their characters while respecting all that came before. To be honest, I never really bought into the Iron Man vs. Captain America ""Civil War"" storyline, but they tie that up nicely.[換行字元][換行字元]Of course the other 4 ""Original 6 Avengers"" - Chris Hemsworth's THOR, Scarlett Johansson's BLACK WIDOW, Mark Ruffalo's BRUCE BANNER and Jeremy Renner's CLINT/HAWKEYE/RONIN - are on hand and they all have their moments and take their bows as appropriate throughout. I also have to give some ""props"" to Don Cheadle's James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes/WAR MACHINE - kind of an unsung performer in these films and is a welcome sight who would have been missed had he not been there.[換行字元][換行字元]The other ""survivors of the snap"" - Bradley Cooper's ROCKET RACOON, Karen Gillan's NEBULA and Paul Rudd's SCOTT LANG/ANT MAN - fit in with the ""original"" Avengers quite well. This group of 10 is fun to watch. Add to them Brie Larson's CAPTAIN MARVEL to mix the drink and the concoction was intoxicating to me. A small ""quibble"" and I do mean a ""quibble"" - Danai Gurira and her character OKOYE is underutlized/underused for my tastes, but...that is just a ""quibble"".[換行字元][換行字元]Oh...and James Brolin is back as ""big bad"" Thanos - a worthy adversary, both emotionally, intellectually and physically for this group of SuperHero's to outwit/outlast/outplay.[換行字元][換行字元]Finally...without giving away any plot points...this story figured out a way to reflect on/pay homage to previous films in this Universe. It was a clever way to bring back stories/characters/moments from the past and to give some of these performers and moments a nice ""cameo"" curtain call.[換行字元][換行字元]I better stop now before I give away plot points - needless to say I LOVED THIS FILM - it was a very satisfying way to say ""thank you and goodbye"" to 11 years (and 22 films) of marvelous film making.[換行字元][換行字元]I'm looking forward to what the next 11 years in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has to offer - the bar has been set at the highest level.[換行字元][換行字元]Letter Grade: A+[換行字元][換行字元]10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
1696,Yeah it's even much better than all Marvel and dc movies and much better than Dark knight. Finally Marvel did it👌 More than a Movie
1697,"But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...[換行字元][換行字元]The past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.[換行字元][換行字元]To me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.[換行字元][換行字元]And the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.[換行字元][換行字元]To me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.[換行字元][換行字元]It seems i maybe in the minority for my feelings towards this film, but im not sugar coating my opinion like it seems a few people are doing due to nostalgia. Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be better, maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible reflects on my score to... Because i just don't give two cents about any of them"
1698,"I've just come back from the cinema and the movie did not disappoint ! Endgame had such high expectations from all MCU followers and i'll have to say it absolutely delivered .The pace was perfect ( not too quick neither too slow , the jokes were ( mostly ) well timed and the plot was smooth . Some of the events could arguably have taken more time/explanation but overall the movie had its moments .Overall , the movie could have been ( arguably ) better but it was definitely good enough ."
1699,"Absolutely perfect ending to the entire saga. There is so much packed into this movie. Emotion, action, drama. I absolutely love it."
1700,"Practically nothing happens in the first 90 minutes, then it eventually speeds up. Usual overly long battle scenes, sone sad moments and enough laughs to keep you interested. Can see more spin offs coming at some stage to keep the money rolling in."
1701,"Just seen this. Reading some reviews on here before going to the cinema had me worried but I personally give it a thumbs up. Infinity war is still my favourite but this film was necessary to end the story. The 3 hours flew by which is a good indication that the story telling was good.[換行字元][換行字元]Many people reviewing on here made it sound like there were flaws and holes in the story but I disagree. Time travel films are always complex and how can anyone argue over a fantasy that is probably not possible anyway. After all, nobody knows whether you would disappear like Marty Mcfly if you were to change your history, do they?[換行字元][換行字元]This film is not just closure of the Thanos story but it is also closure for the back storys of some of the main characters."
1702,"I have watched the movie when it was just released. A couple of months later and I was looking at the reviews. I cannot believe all the 10/10 scores for this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Personally I was extremely disappointed with this final movie. Infinity war was an amazing good movie, end game delivers a very simple story based on the time machine concept with plenty of flaws. While I understand the hype and the popularity of the MCU the movie was not bringing me what I was hoping for. There is no further clarification of what led to this movie. The new hulk is another example what I believe was too far fetched. But I don't think I should continue. Surely it is a must see, but for me remains Endgame one of the less convincing movie of this long series of movies brought to us in the las ten years."
1703,"Russo brother doing impossible thing, they make perfect superhero movies that begining from dark tone and ended with the best moment in cinematic history."
1704,I can't express feelings in words but go to hall and Watch it to feel the real thrill.
1705,Wonderful finish to the best franchise in history. Loved it from the very beginning till the very end. Even the credits that were shown was very emotional.
1706,"This movie has breathtaking visuals and some very good acting from all. The means by which they set out to ""undo Thanos' act of destruction"" is a major cliche that took about half the movie for me to get comfortable with. But the rest of the show was great and they hit all the right emotional notes as well."
1707,Best movie ever in my opinion. A truly epic conclusion. 🤜🏼✌🏼
1708,Watching this movie has me seriously thinking of inventing my own time machine. I would either go back and prevent the Russo brothers from making this movie or at the very least go back in time and not buy tickets to this movie. All my hopes that had been built up for a year were shattered. Dropped. Smashed. Shattered.
1709,"The first hour is too slow and a bit too melodramatic, rather wasteful and boring. The second hour raise it a bit, still not exciting enough though. The final hour is finally where endgame really picks up, and the ending was done nicely as a closure to a great Marvel-eous cinematic journey. It does leave some leads to possible continuation for some of its characters, mainly for Guardians of the Galaxy 3."
1710,Great movie it will be one for the records with a satisfying plot beginning to end
1711,Very good film! It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. There's so much action and twists that'll have u shook. Definitely worth the watch
1712,This movie proves the Russo brothers are in a league of their own when it comes to closing a franchise this big. In my opinion they pulled of the most satisfying ending this story arc could have.[換行字元][換行字元]It's nothing without its previous 21 movies. Must watch for every movie fan.
1713,It might be anticlimatic at the begging but following the next hours it managed to beacame a well acted piece of work. Thank you cast!!!
1714,"Emotional, Impactful, Heartbreaking, Action-Packed, and Hilarious. Endgame is truly the culmination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's 22 film ""Infinity Saga"" and pulls out all the stops for this film, wrapping everything up in a tight bow that feels as beautiful as it is entertaining."
1715,It will literally satisfy every comic book fan snd every single tv fan. You can feel the damage thanos has done rhe movie makes sure of it and it makes it worth the wait when everything is going down.. Just a masterpiece to conclude the end of and era
1716,"This entire movie was based on time travel, it's in the same category as Hot tub time machine. It's so awful its embarrassing."
1717,"The greatness of Endgame comes in the ways it both builds on and pays homage to the many films that have come before it. Truthfully, I find it extremely similar to Infinity War as a movie, but with the core of the film being acceptance of events and moving forwards, rather than the conflicting ideologies and resulting battles of Infinity War. Both are most impressive in their ability to allow an enormous ensemble cast to breathe and never feel rushed or overstuffed, focusing on a few character's arcs and getting the audience invested in them. Endgame also continued to have excellent visual and sound effects, with some stunning action scenes that brilliantly balanced and mixed the strong score with immersive sound effects. The humor was effective and I found the use of homages and self-awareness in referencing past Marvel events or movie tropes (primarily the unrealistic time travel portrayal in movies) to be stronger than the traditional one-liners you find in movies like Ragnarok or Guardians. The plot itself was coherent and reasonable, relying on a fun and plausible ""time heist"", but I found it a bit anticlimactic after the challenging planning that it was so easy as to be almost an afterthought that they secured all the infinity stones (a task that should be monumental). I had my usual qualms with the action scenes, as character's powers or effectivity of specific moves don't seem consistent throughout the fights, but they were fun to watch as characters tried new tactics and it was not just a rehashing of the action we saw in Infinity War. Iron Man and Captain America's character arcs are both satisfying and appropriate for who their characters are and what their goals were. I did find the way Hulk was scripted to be bizarre and frustrating, as he was a character who had struggled to balance the duality of his nature in helping others with uncontrollable rage, and here he felt like a goofy, meandering character lacking well-defined characteristics or audience investment. Thor also had a plausible general story in blaming himself and struggling, but I thought it was played out to an absurd and over the top degree that's not realistic given his character. Still, I have no overarching qualms and felt the movie was handled thoughtfully and emotionally, feeling like the true culmination and crowning achievement that the MCU has built up to. It's satisfying and well done, but I don't think it's a better overall movie than movies like Infinity War or even Black Panther or Winter Soldier just because it's the finale that was done in that satisfying way rather than a more specific or intermediary story. I'm excited to see it shatter some records at the box office and see if it has a chance at a Best Picture nomination - unlikely but definitely possible. A great ending to a great series of films."
1718,"I'm a huge fan of long slow-crawl movies (cue LOTR trilogy) but the first half of this culminating slog was way too slow and artificially melodramatic. This is in stark contrast to Infinity War's well edited, if not somewhat fractured fast paced scenes.[換行字元][換行字元]If anything Infinity War could of used an extra 20min of dialogue and slower pacing edited out of Endgame. In the end, still a fun movie but not without obvious pacing flaws."
1719,"11 years ago when iron man came out who would of thought we would of been here? 20 films later and were in the endgame. Simply incredible, from beginning to end, a feat of cinema. The humour, the emotion, the nostalgia and the satisfaction the movie brings is truly special. There is no other film like it, Stan lee would be proud-heres to another 10 years, excelsior :)"
1720,"I guess they should have taken more time to create the film with good storyline, It didn't meet the expectation which was set in Infinity war. Very slow pace and messy. Not satisfied."
1721,After waiting so long for this film it was rather boring and disappointing. Could of had so much more as a closing film
1722,"Its really great, end it in the best way.[換行字元][換行字元]the most succesfull xmen movie, days of future past, is using the ""time traveler"" formula, and marvel use the same formula.[換行字元][換行字元]i was hoping marvel use other mindblowing idea"

It's without a doubt the best movie I've ever seen and i've seen alot , it's rare that A movie will make me feel Happy , Sad , excited and make me cry all in the same time. I've sat in the chair for three hours without feeling that a second is being wasted , Everything was on point . so if anyone wondering if it's going to be that good or it's Going to be as good as infinity war just take my advice and go see it you will be pleased in every way and the one thing i guarantee you it's gonna top every expectaion you have.

The humour is inserted perfectly while the action scenes are thrilling and despite that ultra long runtime it's paced perfectly.[換行字元][換行字元]Robert Downey jr puts in a fantastic performance as Iron Man as well as Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye.

If you've followed these characters from the beginning and feel emotionally invested in them, you will enjoy this epic film."
1727,"Such a let down & huge disappointment! Infinity War was beyond amazing & perfectly setup for the best ending anyone could ever imagine, until you see this movie. I can't believe the Russo Brothers willingly destroyed our favorite characters we have been built up to love & cherish all these years. The plot holes are continuous & the only thing you learn to count on in this flick. The 1st half is boring & dragged out only to later have nano seconds with the anxiously awaited returned. Such a waste & felt like being robbed of those moments you couldn't wait to see! Beloved Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow and Hulk are all ruined!! The charisma & pizazz is sucked out from all of them. Felt like it was written to only care about Captain America & Hawkeye. There are very few cool moments because it leaves you confused & wanting answers to the new plot holes. Unnecessary deaths & destruction end this era of fine films in to depression & just a ton more questions you feel you deserve answers to after being so loyal & attached. This was supposed to wrap things up & feel like an ending. Nope!"
1728,"First of all I salute to the hard work done by Russo brothers. This film has everything. I see people comparing this movie with others like Infinity war however this stands tall. This is how it should be. We really loved this movie and it gonna be in our mind for a very long time as I don really think that no other movie is going to beat this ever. ( at least for a decade). Whatever is showed has link to other movies, story character , power etc., Love and respect to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.."

It was a really good movie. The last half/ending was much closer to that title of perfection than the first half.[換行字元][換行字元]The first half of this movie was very rushed. Things that were major storylines in last movie were tied up with throw away one lines. Backstories and struggles for certain things were just breezed through and rushed.

1731,Was looking forward to this but a little disappointed with how drawn out this movie was. More action and less talking for me but still a good film with excellent effects. Quite sad too in parts and sad that's the end. Some characters had better parts whilst others sadly not. Could have done more with this film but still makes for a good avengers film.
1732,"It was everything I wanted in a movie and more. Nothing prepared me for the emotion, raw talent and stunning action scenes. Every moment had me at the edge of seat and heart beating out of my chest. The best one the MCU has made in my opinion. And I thought Infinity War was best that would never be topped. Overall they out did themselves with this one."
1733,"It is any movie you could ever ask for. It makes you smile, it makes you cry, and it makes you laugh. It blows your mind and is completely unpredictable. It's all you could ever ask for in a movie. It is the greatest end to a franchise and will be remembered forever."
1734,"I think the movie had been better if the Hulk had more fighting scenes in it other than his acting like a multiple PhD holder. And did they really have to create an obese Thor? I didn't really see the purpose for this transformation, if I could call it that.

But I think we've had enough surprises in infinity war and since it's a popcorn movie I think MARVEL has done its best. We've seen spectacular regiment war scences and astonishing deaths. And that's enough.

1738,This will go down as one of the greatest movies in history. Not a dry eye in the theater right now. I'm not crying! You're crying!
1739,"This movie was a joke,its barely a movie and more of an event this isint even an original movie the only thing this movie did to bring in people was have old mcu movies to make fans feel nostalgic,endames time travel logic was horrible, most overrated movie ever"

The complaints in these reviews completely misunderstood how it worked.[換行字元][換行字元]Second, the other complaint is Thor. Was he weaker? Yeah. Was I disappointed? Yeah, but it follows the progression of his character. He lost his whole family, swore revenge, almost saved the day and missed it by a foot. His demise into self loathing makes perfect sense and allows other characters to shine in battles. Thor tends to be overpowered so this leveled the playing field.[換行字元][換行字元]Third, the pacing is slow and ponderous. But it asks you to follow the characters and their emotions and reactions to the snap. The slow pace allows the characterization to shine and not be overblown by tedious fighting like some scenes in Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, I don't get people's desire for overpowered characters with aimless action scenes. Endgame does a great job creating small moments for personality and giving everyone a chance to shine in battle."

And the final battle is just epic and tops even Lord of the Ring Battles. A must see! the Mist successful movie in history speak dir it Self
1745,"Im a huge Marvel fan, and yes i liked Endgame, but lets be honest... Its not even near 9 or 10 stars. Its more like 6 or 7 stars. Without spoling too much, i have to say the movie is too messy, with duplicated characters, that u can't define who's on each side. Infinity war was way better, than this movie."
1746,"If you've not seen infinity war (which as a stand alone film is better then this) and a fair chunk of the other MCU films then you're gonna hate this. Yes there are plot holes, and a a couple of truly cringeworthy moments pandering to the feminists but overall its a wild ride, its refreshing that it wasn't 3 hours of constant battles (yes transformers I'm looking at you) that just get tedious. There is a story and character development. The 3 hours shoots by, but, you really need to see quite a few of the other MCU films to appreciate it, its not a stand alone film and I'd imagine makes no sense at all without knowing the history - you have been warned!!"
1747,"As close to perfection a superhero film may ever get. I myself love DC but there's no doubt that Marvel reigns supreme when it comes to the lead up build up and storytelling of all the hero films, casting was brilliant and all the ingredients you need to make a superhero film work are here. Even though it's 3 hours long it doesn't feel like it while you are wrapped up in this experience the movies over and your left satisfied although a lil emotional 😢 and with a feeling of bittersweet. A must watch for any comic book fan and as Captain America says ""whatever it takes""... you must see this film!!"
1748,"Saying this is the best movie ever is the equivalent of only watching the season finale of a series without having any context and saying it's the best series ever?! It is entertaining and awe inspiring how they handled the huge cast ensemble, but as a standalone film it is rather lacking. Great if you love the MCU, but it rather bloated in runtime and typically sentimental. Great if you want ""checkout"" for a few hours and enjoy some of the action sequences and the trademark quips expected from this production house."
1749,"Such a great film, great emotion and realism that captivates for the duration of the long run time."
1750,"I can't remember a film that not only lives up to the media hype but blows it out the water. It's truly amazing the plot is solid, the humour is there, but also evokes real emotions. Thank you Marvel you a fitting end..."
1751,"Different people have different point of view , but what we have to respect is , the way the russo's Brought all 21 movies to one is really incredible. We have to respect that . All those movies are from different directors but the Russo's could make this movie epic and let the audience understand it in a very clear way . Respect for that . This movie will be the best movie for me till this date and till the day I enter my coffin ."
1752,"Amazing!! From the get go, tugging at your heart, either with pain, or laughter. We've got it all here, action, comedy parts, despair, nostalgia moments all included. Battle scene was amazing. And a great ending to boot. Hope that we will see a lot more marvel movies for many years to come."
1753,"Superb movie with a lot of surprising plot twist. The movie start slow in the future and ends like a big bang. Great cast, actors and directors. Must watch not only for MCU fans but for all ages and genre."
1754,"It is a love letter... thats what this movie is. Its a rollercoaster of emotions, callbacks from the past, comic book easter eggs, fan service and more laughter and genuine emotions that I thought can be put in a movie. Everybody laughted, cried and were made speachless by the insane moments that occur on screen. Regrdless of this not having an end credits scene it frankly does not need any. Its perfect just the way it is. WATCH IT!"
1755,Robert Downey JR needs an Oscar. Fantastic performance
1756,The movie was fantastic and incredible Sad ending but still one of my favorites marvel movies
1757,"It gave us everything we needed. Heart, humor, action, closure, and a perfect ending. A series can only go on for so long and it was beautiful. Infinity War set the bar high and I'm sure we all expected tremendous satisfaction, although the dialogue was more excessive in Endgame- there was a lot to be explained. I think this was the best result and it's naive to expect more character development, fight scenes, or explanations... there was a 3 hour period and it was executed to the best of its ability. A huge triumph for the avenger saga and I loved every minute of it."
1758,"The film was jam packed with emotion, action, and struggles throughout as the film progresses. It was worth the wait and I have no doubt any big MCU fan would NOT be disappointed!"
1759,"Avengers Endgame really was a movie filled with action, emotions, dept in story and characters and i can't wait to see it again. I won't spoil anything considering Dr. Strange managed to watch endgame 14 million times without spoiling it, but i will say this, you need to watch Infinity war first (if anyone hasn't seen that awesome movie yet, go see it), you need that to understand the backstory. Preferably ALL marvel movies so you get a grasp of each character that might appear.[換行字元][換行字元]But the movie itself doesn't feel like 3 hours, it feels like 1,5 hour, and thats because its stuff happening all the time, and it makes turns you wouldn't see coming, which only makes it better.[換行字元][換行字元]It's an emotional ride just as well as it's a tribute to Stan Lee and all marvel characters. I watched it the 24 of april, but i could easily watch it again tonight.[換行字元][換行字元]On my 'awesomeness' scale this get a solid 10 out of 10."
1760,It was a cool movie and intresting. Not surprised it smashed box office records. RIP Stan Lee
1761,"Avengers: Endgame is truly the end of the era for the MCU. The conclusion 11 years in the making that all Marvel fans have been salivating for (myself included). This could (potentially) be the last time we see some of our favorite heroes we've spent 11 years with on-screen. No pressure! Does it come together in a satisfying way? In many ways, Avengers: Endgame is the conclusion we've all been hoping for, but when it comes to the plot, there is certainly room for improvement. Following the shocking and bold ending of Infinity War, Endgame leaves our heroes sulking for a majority of the first hour over their loss to Thanos, and rightfully so. The opening scene alone sets the tone for the emotional rollercoaster we are in for here. This is a display of Endgame's greatest strength, which is emotional weight. Seeing our characters in fear and desperation in the first hour of the film added to the continuous urgency prevalent here. These emotions only enhance the grander scenes of the film, when there is massive pressure on the characters to be flawless in their various missions. The buildup of the first two hours creates an unbelievably striking third act, where everything comes together in the most beautiful way imaginable. The action is better than ever, and everything fans could have wished for is here, including Captain America wielding mjolnir while shouting ""Avengers Assemble"", Thanos getting his ass kicked, and even Valkyrie riding a pegasus (hell yes to that!). The Russos have done an excellent job of creating a truly unpredictable film, which constantly leaves the viewer surprised and in awe. Sure, many fan theories speculated that time travel would play a key component in the film, but the actual sequence of events is far more complex than we'd been guessing. Interestingly enough, the film is able to juggle some of the most emotional scenes of the franchise along with humor to create a mostly successful cocktail. Bruce Banner's merge with The Hulk was a welcome addition to the film, as well as ""Lebowski Thor"", even though that joke ran its course a bit long for my taste. I'm not sure if anything was quite as good as Captain America whispering ""Hail Hydra"" to the Shield/Hydra agents in the elevator though. There is a lot to love in Avengers: Endgame, and especially if you've been following the franchise since the beginning. However, the film is not flawless. There is one major problem in the film that holds it back from ranking among the best films of the MCU, and that is the incorporation of time travel. We all knew that time travel would play a key role in the film, but what we didn't know was how sloppy the rules would be. Banner and The Chosen One explain how time travel works in a certain way, but the film often contradicts that and chooses its own route. Sure, someone could argue that ""this is a superhero movie, don't think about it too much"", but I'd argue that X-Men: Days of Future Past has shown that time travel can be executed pretty much perfectly in a superhero movie. That film did a much better job of sticking to a specific set of rules rather than just choosing what's most convenient for the plot. Since time travel plays a huge role in the sequence of events in Endgame, the Russos s**ting the bed with this really hurt. I don't want to get into the actual time travel, because I'd turn into that picture of Charlie Day from Always Sunny when he's obsessed with the conspiracies, but here's a link that clearly explains what the film is conveying and how it is actually executed: This is why I compared this to The Dark Knight Rises in the title. The film is much more character based than the previous installment, has some of the best moments of the franchise, and is genuinely surprising (albeit, Endgame's surprises are much more satisfying), the massive plot holes in the film take away from what should have been the best film of the franchise. I enjoyed the film a lot, but as someone who likes thinking about films in depth, I was left pretty cold by the execution here. If you're able to look past these major continuity issues, you'll probably love the death out of this movie. As much as I wanted to, I just couldn't."
1762,"Perfect superhero movie. Tied everything together and answered so many questions. I'm still smarting from Natasha's untimely demise, but it was inevitable. I am going to miss her character so much. Tony not so much....bad week to be a Stark LOL."
1763,"To make it short (the movie was to long already): Infinity War was better, more entertaining and held up to it's expectations.[換行字元][換行字元]This one just didn't do it for me. And I can't stress this enough: It was waaaaay to long."
1764,"I am bit confused and I wonder if I am.the only one.[換行字元][換行字元]Don't get me wrong. I appreciate hard work put by the team but it seems that praise it is getting from all corners is more than what it actually deserves, It is a fiction and imagination is the limit but hey there is a point where you say to yourself it is getting to point of being silly.[換行字元][換行字元]I expected much more."
1765,"I recently watched this with two of my mates at a midnight showing and absolutely loved it. From start to finish it's fun and inventive and full of emotion, with even better effects than infinity War had . By far the best Marvel film. Deserves to be in the top 100 on IMDb."
1766,"9/10 - an impressive cast list, an enthralling storyline, and an epic end to an era enables this superhero flick to stand out among the increasing monotony of the genre"
1767,"Avengers - Endgame offers a stunning and moving ending. The best I could've expected. Many people cried... Thank you Marvel for this experience, I don't know If it'll ever happen again."
1768,"Endgame is everything one could have wanted from an MCU movie and more: fantastic characters, epic moments, and a plot that keeps you on your feet for all three acts. The action, cinematography, comedy, and climax are truly awesome and the final hour of the film left me almost unable to stop smiling in awe and wonder. To cap it all off, the movie has insane re-watchability, an uncommon trait in most MCU movies, meaning I'll probably be buying this movie on home media as well. While the massive 3 hour runtime could have been cut/streamlined slightly (namely in the first act) and the logic of an important part of the plot is a bit confusing (no spoilers), Endgame absolutely makes up for it by providing one of the most epic, powerful, and fun cinema experiences I've ever had."
1769,"Having panned through all 11 years of Marvel movies and watching each one on release, I think Endgame is the most pure, most sufficient successor to Infinity War I would never have imagined to exist.[換行字元][換行字元]It truly excels in ways that Infinity War didn't, and that's the defining attribute to it. While Infinity War was there to unite universes and undo them, Endgame did the opposite, and added in a whole TRUCKLOAD of satisfaction into the mix. You will not find a better duo in cinematic history that complement each other so."
1770,Everyone should go and watch it in the theatre. Ironman is simply the best👍 I didn't know that 3hrs was that short and it disappeared like the other half with a snap from Thanos. 'I love you 3000' from a DC fan.
1771,"Right, this film is excellent. I would say I preferred Infinity War, as it was right in your face from the beginning. Now Endgame, has a lot of build up. So all that rubbish about not being able to go for a pee, in fear of missing something. Do so in the first two hours.[換行字元][換行字元]Watch out for the peanut butter sandwich."
1772,Someone asked me why I cried after watching endgame and I started crying one again and very hard. You need to watch all marvel movies before watching it as to understand this movie you need to connected to avengers by heart. Love you avengers.
1773,"Must watch saga of epic proportions and beyond words amazing, best version of storytelling, superb, mind-blowing, extremely satisfying. All the graphics, VFX and action sequences are so vivid and engaging. True tribute to heros and fans by Marvel for last 11 years of adventure. Must watch on IMAX 3D"
1774,"The second the iconic Marvel intro began, I was crying buckets. By far the best super hero film of all time. A complete finish to the most epic saga. Bring two buckets... one for your popcorn and one for your tears."
1775,This is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen. 11 years and 22 movies all leading up to this one big epic conclusion. The Russo's deserve all the praise in the world for this movie.
1776,"One the the best Entertainment in the MCU franchise, Hoping it will continue to Entertain us"
1777,"As the continuation of the ""Avangers: Infinity War"" movie, this film was successful to make the audience feel very curious about the end of the story. This film tests whether you are really Marvelous or not. When you watch this film, you will feel every second of this film is a pity to miss. Three hours duration of this film feels nothing for me, even I wish it could be a little longer.[換行字元][換行字元]A continuous story from previous films makes this film very interesting to watch and also difficult to predict the end of this film. Anyone who might miss the previous Marvel films related to this film might not understand the parts related to this ""Avengers: Endgame"" film. I think the camera and sound effects is perfect. Each of actor and artist successfully plays the hero character entrusted to them very well.[換行字元][換行字元]A good teamwork is very highlighted in this film. This film teaches that the optimism in achieving a goal, even though it must pass a big challenge. When I watch this film, I feel touched by the struggle and the sacrifice made by the team. Every scene from this film has its own meaning, even It's not hesitate to shed tears for some sad scenes. I want to watch this movie again and again because i just want to say that this is one of the best Marvel films. If possible, I want to give 11/10 rate for this amazing film."
1778,Avengers : Endgame has just released so i am not going to say anything about the film other than its the greatest spectacle i have ever seen and i will likely be returning to the cinema tomorrow to watch again.[換行字元][換行字元]Anyone who is leaving 1 star reviews on this movie is a pathetic human being. If you have seen the film you are clearly a fan of the series and i cannot fathom how any fan of the Avengers can give this less than a 9 at worst.[換行字元][換行字元]Those reviews should be deleted as they are clearly trolls with issues in their life.[換行字元][換行字元]Truly sad that people try and mess around with a movies success by leaving reviews when they likely haven't even seen the film.[換行字元][換行字元]Go see this NOW!!!
1779,"I cried in at least 5 points of the film, some tears of joy and some of sorrow. Seriously go watch it now. Or if you haven't watched the previous 21 MCU films, watch them now and then go watch Endgame. A truly incredible finale."
1780,"I'm not a huge superhero movie fan but I have 2 sons and a husband who love them so i get dragged to watch the movies for opening day. This film was truly amazing and blew it out of the water. From the actors, the cgi and the amazing battle scenes it was all superb The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because of the last 5 minutes I thought that part didn't fit with the rest of the movie and let it down a little"
1781,This is definitely one of the best films I've ever seen. A brilliant conclusion to the MCU and I can't wait for more content. 😊
1782,I had huge expectations after infinity war. This is moving was totally overrated and I couldn't get why they are trying to make 3 hour long.
1783,"Wow there are so many troll reviews by inarticulate rubes who can't even explain their opinions.[換行字元][換行字元]People are entitled to their own tastes, and the super hero genre of the Marvel variety that is a pastiche of action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy doesn't appeal to everyone, but for what it is, for what it succeeds at being for its target audience, Avengers: Endgame is currently the benchmark as a satisfying grand finale in a cinematic universe.[換行字元][換行字元]There can be no doubt that Infinity War and Endgame are masterpieces. That doesn't mean they're the best movies ever made, or that they're better than other masterpieces of different genres, it just means that it succeeds in every element required of it.[換行字元][換行字元]The barrier of entry to The Avengers, especially the last two films, is quite high and requires someone to watch a lot of movies, and without an investment in those characters in the Marvel film that lead up to Infinity War and Endgame, a casual viewer will not care the same way a fan will. Yet that shouldn't detract from how skillfully the writers and directors manage to balance so many elements and fuse so many genres to deliver a unique piece of pop-entertainment that is full of humor, spectacle, and drama.[換行字元][換行字元]The Avengers is not a particularly profound franchise. It doesn't attempt to be allegorical like The Lord of The Rings, it isn't as mind-expanding as The Matrix, it isn't as mystical as the original Star Wars, nor does it make any social commentary like The Dark Knight, but it has plenty of great archetypal characters who embody different aspects and struggles with heroism. Each character plays so well off the other and the cast has so much chemistry.[換行字元][換行字元]No other franchise understands its characters better than Marvel, and no writers have a better grasp of heroic conflict and camaraderie than Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Comparing their work in Endgame to other franchises like the DCU's Justice League or the current Star Wars is night and day.[換行字元][換行字元]That isn't to say Endgame is perfect. A Masterpiece doesn't have to be perfect, and most aren't. Certain elements of the plot feel rushed and loopholes are glossed over. Not all the jokes land, but most are pretty funny. Captain Marvel is way too powerful which constantly makes her a Deus Ex Machina. There are any combination of nitpicky observations I could make about parts that don't exactly make sense, but those are minor.[換行字元][換行字元]Admittedly, I do have a bit of Marvel fatigue after this. It almost feels like Endgame was so epic that I don't ever need to see another super hero movie again. Sure, I'll probably see the new Spider-Man, and even though I really like the films and the character, it's reaching a point of over-saturation."
1784,If this was the last mcu movie I would be perfect happy with it
1785,"I like superhero movies like Spiderman 1 & 2, which have simple common storyline and great action. Avenger 2012 was good too. But these final 2 movie of Avenger are really overhyped. These two avenger movie are not good as Avenger 2012. It is so successful in box office that is the best part of it. It's not a great movie as we expected and rating in IMDB will going to be fall down. my rating for this movie is 6/10. The main problem in the movie is, they try hard to be sentimental but for me superhero movie means a lot of action and good-feel kind of story."
1786,"Endgame is a perfect blend of emotions packed in 3 hour show. There were moments when I was at edge of my seat and some were when I felt very sad. Many references and much anticipated moments are there in this movie and definitely every marvel fan will love this movie. The movie raises a lot of questions and definitely shakes the present MCU timeline. Some may even find plot holes in it. But as a single movie, It was exceptional. Combining so many characters and their depiction on a single screen is a hell of a job and I would really bow for the team behind success of endgame. Waiting for more from MCU."
1787,The best possible ending to a saga that's lasted and thrived for the past 10 or so years.
1788,It's almast 3 hour but you would not feel it too long.
1789,Honestly 10 stars rating because it's over. After 10 years it's over. Worth maybe 7 or 8 stars. Infinity war was better. Thank you Stan Lee. Thank you MCU.
1790,"The more I think about this movie the more disappointed I am. And the more I try to pretend it never happened.[換行字元][換行字元]In the cinema I was sort of swept in all the pictures but as pretty as they were, they don't really hold up very well under closer scrutiny. They are like cotton candy, it looks really nice, is very sweet but in the end, it's just sugar.[換行字元][換行字元]There was very little substance and they tried to fill the movie with surprises and twists and the unexpected to hide it. And they kind of failed.[換行字元][換行字元]There were some story points that were handled very well. Some that could be hand-waved into appreciation. And then some that were just straight up terrible - e.g. the whole Steve's story line.[換行字元][換行字元]After all the build up in the previous movies, this movie was kind of a let down.[換行字元][換行字元]And my question stands: What about Bucky?"
1791,"It deserves a score around 6 or 6.5, i gave 5 to compensate the overhype. Even the ending after the fight was boring. However probably because it was the last one. If it was 2 hrs fine by me but 3 hrs was too much. First hours was seriously boring."
1792,After being faced with impossible expectations. Avengers endgame not only achieves expectations but exceeds them.
1793,"Without revealing too much, I enjoyed the movie. Yes, three hours sounds like a lot, but I managed to do it without pausing for a bathroom break. Now that I think about it, this is the last time I'll sit through a three-hour movie. But enough about that.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie grabs you and won't let go until the end. The three hours pass pretty quickly and even though Stan Lee is no longer with us, I'm sure he got a proper send-off. I just don't remember where. But I'm glad he was a part of the MCU movie saga. All of the Avengers do battle with a powerful enemy. Who will survive? Who will not? All that will be revealed when you watch the movie. If you've been following the MCU closely, this will be the major climax."
1794,"I dont see why people think its that great. We already know whats gonna happen. They just copy it from the comics. You want a good superhero movie. Make the movie first, then the comic book. It will save time and money."
1795,"Don't stick around for a bonus following the credits, there is none. That will save you 10 minutes.[換行字元][換行字元]I like the premise of this story, but the directors simply couldn't stick to the central thread and execute anything focused. Talk about chasing squirrels. This film embraces sidetracks.[換行字元][換行字元]Then there are the jokes: zingers are fired every minute and two-thirds fall flat. The directors are really self-impressed or heavily stoned.[換行字元][換行字元]There's a ton of action, but the film drags under its own weight. Nothing feels lean or limber. Secondary stories aren't trim or judicious -- they play like mini episodes. Too much bloat.[換行字元][換行字元]Makeup looks weird, too: the principal cast looks quite old and several of the actors have noticeable dye jobs. Brie Larson and Tom Holland look childlike by comparison. There was a massive digital department. What happened?[換行字元][換行字元]If you get off watching an hour of fireworks, the end battle should be right up your alley. This is the more-is-more treatment. There are a few cheers, but like the jokes, far too few for the length of the segment. During the battle and following scene, pulling close-ups on the characters is tiresome and clumsy."
1796,Watching Endgame I was so excited for it I was like a kid at Christmas. 2 hours and a half later I woke up and we were at the end of the film watching the final battle.[換行字元][換行字元]Long winded.. but full of those little moments that make it all worth it making into an all time great. Ground breaking visuals and a great finisher for the franchise.
1797,"This movie is literally perfect, from the soundtrack to the editing, the acting especially, everything is amazing. I honestly didn't know I could love a movie so much! I cried at least twice, and it has the best fight scene in marvel history. No spoilers, but the ending will leave you feeling satisfied, like you've just watched the end of an era. Truly a fantastic era. Thank you Stan."
1798,"This movie represents everything great this era of movies can ever give, it's well made and it gives a great ""thank you"" for all the viewers who have been following this line of movies.."
1799,"I have no words to describe how my emotions are right now. Simply perfect. The actors, the effects, scenarios, EVERYTHING[換行字元][換行字元]Glad to have the opportunity to watch this movie and my first premiere ever, 3 hours that went veeeeeery fast"
1800,"Little long but is pretty cool, all the super hero's were cool but not exactly sure where vision was?!?"
1801,"It's was so nice to see that movie, I just cant describe my emotions to this comment but 2 thing I can say that Team Avenger did great"
1802,"Not as action-packed as Infinity War but the story and writing are the best of this generation.[換行字元][換行字元]The action doesn't seem as forced as it does in other marvel movies, it's obvious that the directors wanted to focus more on the story and writing of the film and that's understandable judging by how Infinity War ended and how that would put a lot of weight and depth to the characters and story of Endgame. Don't get me wrong there is a reasonable and realistic amount of action in the first 2 hours of the movie, enough for it to be a 1980s masterpiece.[換行字元][換行字元]The last hour of this movie, just left me speechless; I cannot begin to say how proud I am to be alive to witness this unforgettable hour. It includes everything a masterpiece should include, from amazing camerawork to important representation to jaw dropping action to a rollercoaster of emotions, Making the audience jump, shake, smile, scream, cheer, sweat, and of course cry as if they are inside the movie and witnessing everything.[換行字元][換行字元]The ending just fits perfectly like a 22-movie puzzle, like every single little thing that's happened in this movie and every MCU movie before it is just a piece of the puzzle and now that the puzzle is finally complete, you feel satisfied and surreal due to what you've just experienced. This is a spoiler-free review so if you have not seen Avengers: Endgame yet, I suggest that you do because trust me, you will not forget this one."
1803,"Avengers: Endgame definitely pulls at the heartstrings. The plot was well developed, and it was a great end to a great arc. By no means am I saying this was perfect. There were several parts that seemed to be forced in purely to setup for Phase Four and Spider-Man: Far From Home. All in all, the movie truly deserves the name of ""Endgame""."
1804,"This is the best superhero film I have ever seen! It can't get any better. All hats off to Russo brothers for making this possible. I wish I could go back in time (no puns intended) and watch it over again for the first time. Mind blowing movie, this can't get any better. I will watch this numerous times in theatre, everybody should. Watch it in IMAX 3D for quality experience. There are so many emotions in this, I am not sure if people are ready to handle this. This will be in everyone's heart for a long long time."
1805,Since 2008 and Iron man the MCU has been a force to be dealt with but it finally came to an end last night and I have to say that I'm going to miss all of the old school characters.
1806,"I saw this with my entire family in a theater. It was house full with too much clapping n whistling n some of the dialogues went bouncer. Will watch it again but I feel it is not on par with Infinity War. In Infinity War, the war sequence n the fight scenes were all shot in broad daylight n that too in an open field of Wakanda without the fast paced camera tricks. It was visible who was fighting who but Endgame's war sequence is shot in the dark with too much fast paced camera tricks. At times it became hectic to make out who is fighting who. The entry of Thor during the war in Infinity was epic but in Endgame it was duds. The entry of Captain America with the background sound to save Vision in Infinity War was again epic but in Endgame it is not at all exciting. Rocket's one liners were good though."
1807,"I just sleeping in the movie theather, because, okay this is a ""Endgame"", but this movie doesn't have action and i didn't know why this movie don't a sink me."
1808,Story is too weak to thrill anyone. the fighter and flying worms from thanos were supposed to die even at no strike. The culminating part (battle) of the movie was childish. 2/3 time was boring and ridiculous overacting scenes
1809,Kudos to the whole team! Especially the writer and directors for bringing these amazing heroes together. 2019 is for Avengers Endgame. The whole cast was huge & perfect. It is a perfect Visual Treat!. Don't miss this film. Watch it only in theatres for the best experience!. Marvel's best movie.
1810,This emotional ending is perfectly balanced with the action packed setup from Infinity War. Marvel did an amazing job making an often-surprising and satisfying movie to tie up all the plot threads. There is nothing quite like the MCU and this movie displayed how far Marvel has taken each of its characters relationships throughout the last 10 years. Loved it!
1811,"Nothing to tell,It's an Worst movie of all time in the entire Hollywood film industry."
1812,"Endgame is not perfect but it is astoundingly triumphant, epic, and thoroughly enjoyable. It is a true blockbuster of blockbusters!"
1813,"Many plot holes and goofs, however it's all forgivable, given the large scale, number of characters and complexity of combining various MCU story arcs. The Russo brothers have gifted the real world by bringing to life comic book characters in a way that this generation will cherish forever. Each main character had their own time to shine on screen and has been given the respect and honour they deserve after 10 years of storytelling, which has developed them specially to this moment. The Russo brothers should be proud of their work."
1814,"This movie was EPIC!!! Seriously, Marvel could not have brought phase 3 to a close any better. I have never been one to cry at movies but this one had me in tears at different points. Whether you have followed the MCU fromthe beginning or binge watched every movie the week before (yes, you'll need at least a week), you will not be disappointed. Very excited to see what phase 4 has in store. Cheers Marvel!"
1815,"It was good.... not great.... just good. I was expecting more, but satisfied with what I got."
1816,This was the best marvel film I have ever seen and the action was off the charts I just don't like what they did to carol's hair at all.
1817,"A very good movie, a good end but not the best end."
1818,"This movie was build up since 2008. This has been one of the best MCU moments they ever shown. Not only this Movie was epic,but also emotional as well. This movie shown what is like to have an emotional roller coaster journey.Amazing conclusion to an epic journey.A fitting climax that takes infinity war to another level.I am Already planning to see it again.This is the movie that Marvel fans deserved."
1819,"The end of the eleven years journey is a homage to all the happened, and also a celebration of what this characters means or should means, because they are more than heroes; they are symbols. It's by far the most passionate e emotional MCU movie, it's breathtaking from the incredible beginning to the even most incredible ending. I don't have enough words to describe the awesome sensation that I'm having since I watched the movie last night. This movie was made for us the fans, not only as consumers but as people that have been involved with this characters and this universe for the past eleven years. Avengers Assemble."
1820,"The better the ratings on a sci-fi movie the worse the science, but who cares if we're being fed thus absorb ""fake"" information. More combustion powered & structurally dumb space vehicles making sounds in the vacuum of space & swooshing sounds in air. Well, looks cool as do all the super powers that seem to get crazier w/each new series release. Why are little things like glassy rocks so empowered in sci-fi/fantasy movies? Usual dumbed down dialogue except the three worded line by one famous (and the movie is loaded w/famous) actor (bet you can't guess who). Started slow, but got hot 'n' heavy towards the end."
1821,Cant ask for an even more satisfying ending than what the film offfered!
1822,"The movie was great, there's no doubt about it, but that was it. Coming off the shock value that Infinity War brought meant that nothing in this film surprised me, actually there really wasn't any surprises- everything was just as you'd expect it, which was slightly disappointing in itself. I remember after infinity war, people in the cinema were speechless, crying, sobbing, hugging each other - there was nothing like that here. I wish there were more surprises. It was also a little slow overall but at the same time a good celebration of the last 11 years."
1823,"A marvellously epic & enormously satisfying extravaganza that concludes a decade's worth of narrative on a thumping & triumphant note, Avengers: Endgame is a crescendo, a celebration, a closure & a culmination of a 22-film saga that returns our 11 years of investment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a massive pay-off. A memorable finale of an unprecedented cinematic universe that won't soon, if ever, find an equal, Endgame is Marvel Studios' magnum opus."
1824,"Wow, just wow. Russo brothers deserve all the praise in the world forb somehow pulling this off. This movie will go down as one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments in history, whIle it might not compete with Th Dark Knight Trilogy conclusion. Satisfaction is not even a word to describe this. 10/10"
1825,I enjoyed Endgame a lot. It had a lot of emotion and great fight scenes. I think they did a good job tying up the loose ends and setting up the next phase of the MCU.
1826,"Well, i believe that this movie was the perfect conclusion to the MCU, the intensity of the movie was outstanding and the amount of action scenes was spetacular. Loved what the movie brought to us, the perfect end to a great sequence of movies that made us grow. THANK YOU MARVEL"
1827,THIS movie was a good movie overall I loved it and so will you WATCH IT RIGHT NOW
1828,"Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team."
1829,Surprisingly good ending for this phase of marvel movies. Done brilliantly
1830,First film to make me cry since home alone 4 on VHS in 2011
1831,"This film is the conclusion of the infinity saga series containing all 22 films for the past 10 years. Plotwise is great. It's a great storytelling. Few scenes are weird but acceptable. Marry Sue? Very few. OP? Just very few. It's reasonable and fun to watch every minutes. Nebula's arc is good and the actress is great. Every 6 main character's arcs including Ant-man are decent. There are shocks and twists but reasonable also. Characters from the past return and add very good additional contexts. The screenwriters, directors and producers made a good job. The CGI is good and realistic. The acting is world class. Many characters but they lifts up each other in the good way. Every actors are great. I can see myself go back to watch it ten times, and I can do this all day. Enjoy :) I actually rate this movie 9.6/10, but lean towards 10."
1832,"Without second thoughts I would say that it wad the most impressive work for Marvel.. makes you feel sad, happy, excited and thrilled to the max all in one movie"
1833,"Was a great end to the Avengers Series. There was laughter, humour, action, comedy, along with emotions. This had it all. Not sure what the buzz about Captain Marvel was but was quiet irrelevant to this story in my opinion. Hulk, Thor stole the show for me. Iron Man and Cap great as always. The 3 hours flew past. I give it a 9/10 just because of Captain Marvel spoiling it."
1834,"(No spoilers here) Avengers: Endgame is a triumph. I couldn't think of a more satisfying conclusion to this era of the MCU. It starts off slow, but still very interesting. The first two acts definitely focus more on character work than having a very tightly paced film that doesn't even allow you to breathe such as Infinity War. We start out with the main cast in a state of defeat and devastation from the events of Infinity War and let me just say, we get some great, great, great performances here. The acting in this movie is so freaking good! The first act takes the characters down some really unexpected paths. Some of them I was all for, but two of them (won't say who) I found questionable. Once the second act starts and they come up with a plan to undo what Thanos did in Infinity War, that's when things get REALLY interesting. They time travel back to a few past MCU movies and not only deliver nostalgia and great payoffs, but also gives a deeper understanding and a greater appreciation for these past movies. There were also quite a few ""Oh shoot!"" moments as well. The first two acts were great, but the third was freaking mind boggling! The set piece, the action, the scope, the intensity, the stakes, the jaw dropping moments, the raw emotion, it's all here and I could not think of a better final battle. Just wow! This movie does carry quite a deal of heavy moments and a couple of death scenes which are very impactful. A lot of people in my theater were silently crying at the end. I didn't, but man it hurt! My favorite characters in the film were probably the big three (Cap, Iron Man, and Thor). If I had to choose one, it would have to be Cap. The completion to his arc was just incredible. Poetic, sweet, and extremely heartfelt. Just brilliant. There are a few (and I mean very few) gripes/nitpicks I have with this movie, but the magnitude of this film's greatness effortlessly gobbles up those tiny little nuisances. If you're a person like me who has seen every MCU film, then this movie was incredibly rewarding. However, if you're going into this movie blind or only having seen a few years f the MCU entries, it's likely you'll get confused quite often and miss most of the great callbacks. But I think you would find that there's still a ton of fun to be had with this one.[換行字元][換行字元]Sweet, powerful, epic, emotional, gargantuan, poetic, symbolic, deep, rewarding, shocking, unpredictable, satisfying, Avengers: Endgame is a movie that will most definitely be talked about for generations. The MCU is truly the Star Wars of this generation. My grade: A+"
1835,After so many movies...... It seemed Thanos was more powerful and gave them a beat down without the stones. It would have been nice to see the avengers fight him with all his stones
1836,"Once it's over, it's over. Lots of credits. Very slow moving. Don't bother sitting through them.[換行字元][換行字元]Movie made us both laugh and cry and was perfectly written, acted, and directed. Loved it!"
1837,"It is a great movie, 3 great hours, but not great acting, there is no acting, just super heros costumes"
1838,"This is the best movie ever ! It's funny, has a lot of action and it's very, very, very exciting. And if you do not understand this movie, please don't rate it because it's a very nice movie and I know you need to know A LOT about marvel before you watch it but it's just that people rate it though they do not understand it. If you do not like it, it's different because you can rate it then but not understanding is a different thing. Anyway in my opinion this a fantastic movie. And that's the same for most of the people who understand it. So what I'm trying to say is that this is a movie you will like very much if you see the other MCU movies."
1839,"I'm a bit disappointed on the melodramatic first act. It was a really, really poorly written melodramatic first act.[換行字元][換行字元]It was, with Black Panther and Hulk, the most boring passage of a Marvel MCU movie. Some great parts here and there (mostly Tony, which was basically god like perfect in this movie, including Downey's perfect acting) and Rocket.[換行字元][換行字元]When the actual movie starts (and stops being basically an epilogue, a bad one, to Infinity War), it gets interesting even if a bit confusing (even with three hours, the plot explanation goes fast).[換行字元][換行字元]And in the end, the movie lands the epic ending. No words necessary.[換行字元][換行字元]Also, I would never watch that first hour and a half again. Which is a shame, considering how perfect Infinity War was.[換行字元][換行字元]-------Oh I forgot (this is an edit). Captain Marvel was in this movie (barely). I absolutely ADORE HER in every aspect. Her attitude. Her character. The actress. The looks.[換行字元][換行字元]But oh boy, her power level! Don't know if it's good or bad yet"
1840,The best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best The best the best The best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best The best the best
1841,The hype is promising really good ending to the infinity saga.
1842,I love all the marvel movies 100%!! But this one.... Omg. THIS IS A BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!
1843,My entire childhood has led to this movie and it shattered every expectation.
1844,"All these superhero films these days. The general IQ of the population is at an all time low as people lap this crap up. You have to be a mega geek to like this film. I'm talking mother's basement levels. Overly PC, overly CGI, couldn't care less about any characters. 3 hour film with over 2 hours of nothing happening then a rip off, much worse version of Lord of the Rings end battle.[換行字元][換行字元]All the sheep out there will see it and love it because they cannot think for themselves and have been spoon fed this crap for years. Is this what passes for a good film these days? We live in sad times people. I did not pay to see this movie and I still want my money back."
1845,"Disney ruins what could have been otherwise a PERFECT cinematic finale for a decade of great films with that one forced feministic scene. You know which one. This is why; lets rewind back to the first Avengers movie to the scene when the whole team is gathering preparing for battle; THAT CLASSIC SCENE that was in every trailer and promotional material, we saw all the avengers being ""assembled"", males and female getting ready for a stand in battle, then we saw a second ""assemble"" in Age Of Ultron, the a third one in Civil War, now lets jump to this new scene.... where are all the males? wouldn't have been double ""cool"" if we saw all of our heroes females and males homaging that first movie scene showing off how much the group has grew since then? What was the reasoning; story wise, behind the female characters for doing that specially in the middle of a fight? Instead of bringing together the two genders as EQUALS, DISNEY decided to split them and chose the females over the male ones, ""for reasons"", and now the movie will be terrible dated. On the topic of gender issues in media a wise celebrity once said: ""Swap all the genders of the characters in that movie, if their actions look bad now then that is NOT equality"" Nothing can be perfect; just like with The Lord Of The Rings The Return Of The King; another great epic finale for a film series, the movie could have been without that infamous Legolas vs. Elephant scene. An even bigger crime is that nowhere is a dedication or in memory to Stan Lee to be found nor before nor after the credits. Why?"
1846,"I am out of words, I just watched the movie twice back to back and i still want to go back and watch it again. Russo brothers have given us fans more than what we asked for. This movie has everything, drama, action, humor, emotion. Best way to end the avengers. Although everyone was part of this movie, the original 6 avengers made every second of this 3 hour movie worth watching."
1847,"I was a little taken aback by this movie. It was not nearly as tightly written as Infinite Wars, it had multiple plot holes, sloppy moments, wooden acting. I don't know how they managed to screw this up, but they kinda did, didn't they? In fact, I'd say this is the worst Avengers movie. However, as entertainment, it kept me interested enough to warrant 7 stars. But overall just a surprisingly disappointing end to an era in the MCU."
1848,"Have been on this journey from Iron Man 1,going along not knowing it'll end up here, many will tell you how spectacular it was or is a magnaum opas but it's a journey of us of characters along with whom we have set out to become a better human being, it'll your chords, chok you up, make you laugh, and greatful to be on this journey."
1849,Why they didn't include more fighting? 3 hours is too long to a story without a lot ot action scenes in a Superhero's movie
1850,"Cheap dialogs, non sense violence. The only thing the movie has to offer is explosions. Is it really that hard to make quality superhero movies? Look at Christopher Nolan's series of Batman movies, those are quality films. This movie is flat, it can be consumed as fast food, nothing to offer really"
1851,"Infinity war was a tough act to follow; ultimately nothing was likely to be sufficient as a closing act. Disregarding plot holes, which don't really matter to much in an action film, there are a few aspects which brought the film low.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is very self-indulgent with fan service. A little is fine, but it's a massive component in this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]There's Ragnarok-level humour, which will undoubtedly be to the tastes of many - just not mine.[換行字元][換行字元]The film is very slow to get off the ground. That's fine as long as there is some real substance, but it's lacking.[換行字元][換行字元]Characters have been handicapped in order to curb the power creep, where as others are momentarily escalated in ability. This is not uncommon, but very noticeable in this flick due to the volume.[換行字元][換行字元]Of course, you're going to see it regardless; don't go in sky-high expectations and you'll probably have a good time."
1852,"The movie is the perfect ending to 11 years of MCU. I have never seen a crowd so engaged, cheering, crying, laughing while watching any movie. Hats off to the whole team for the ultimate experience !"
1853,Inevitably..It should become the highest grossing movie of all time... #PART OF THE JOURNEY IS THE END #IRONMAN #we (the marvel fanbase all around the world) love you 3000
1854,I was shocked. Best superhero movie I have ever seen
1855,"This serves as the conclusion to the entire Marvel universe Infinity Stones saga. Not that there aren't going to be anymore movies. Disney likes making money. But with several main actors' contracts being up and bowing out, this will be the end for several of the original Avengers team. What results is something we've never quite see in a film: a season finale, the culmination of a franchise of multiple movies, characters, and story arcs. (The sheer logistics involved making this must've been insane.) And I had the hell of a time with it all![換行字元][換行字元]The one big issue about Avengers: Infinity War, the first installment of this film two-parter, is that it had to juggle so many characters, that there wasn't a lot of time for characterization. However, now the cast is narrowed down to mostly the original Avengers. Brought back is the characterization that made so many of the previous films. Here we find the heroes at their lowest and trying to right things. What proceeds is a great character piece We see the conclusion to some of stories of people we've gotten to know after all these years. The finale is the most I've ever been emotionally influenced by a film.[換行字元][換行字元]Although this is an ensemble piece, Robert Downey Junior's Tony Stark/Iron Man is the big lead, the hero that started the whole universe off and all his scenes, his highs and low, are great.[換行字元][換行字元]Thanos is in less of this, but the cool, collected planner still makes a great villain.[換行字元][換行字元]Fans of the movie also get to see callbacks to so many plot points and surprise character appearances. (Although, some things might fly over your head if you can't remember or haven't had the time or inclination to watch everything.) In fact, be prepared for many surprises in general.[換行字元][換行字元]There is some pretty serious subject matter here, especially the first act. However the script manages to nicely balance this with humor. Both Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man have some great delivery and lines.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie looks great. (Again, the ability to make Thanos' facial expressions look so realistic is amazing.) Although, I wished some scenes were lit a little brighter. You can't always make everything out. The final fight scene is amazing and may be considered one of the all time greats.[換行字元][換行字元]Admittedly, the movie doesn't have quite the tension of Infinity Wars. The second act is interesting, but not as strong as the beginning or end.[換行字元][換行字元]Considering the hype of Captain Marvel being in this, she really isn't used much. Karen Gillan does a great job as Nebula and she appears more than in any of her other films, but I kind of still wanted to see more interaction between her the and the other cast mates. A majority of characters from previous films are in this, but if you wanted to find out whatever happened to Lady Sif or Sharon Carter be prepared to be disappointed. I'm really surprised about Sharon, considering that the directors who forged her character did this movie, too.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, this movie was an event that will make you feel all the feels, and I recommend you see this before it's spoiled.[換行字元][換行字元]P.S. Don't worry about sticking through the credits. No end final scene this time. (They really wanted to set this up as a final chapter.) Thought there is a slight something if you're a movie completionist."
1856,Honestly Endgame is the one of the best movie in the world Youll laugh You'll amaze And you'll cry Forget the time travel theory's Otherwise it's best movie of all time
1857,"Please give me back the 3 hours spent in the theater to see this.[換行字元][換行字元]All plot is overall stupid, it's like sooooooo long... and stretched..[換行字元][換行字元]To much hype for.. nothing actually."
1858,No words can describe this amazing end to 10 years of films.
1859,"Fantastic capstone to sit atop the MCU. I went in with high expectations, and they were all blown away. You have to see this one in a theater!"
1860,"Ugh. This three hour opus did not need to be three hours.[換行字元][換行字元]Sure, it had moments. I love you 3000 being a stellar one. America's ass being another.[換行字元][換行字元]But mostly ick. Still I watched it as I have been a fan of the rest. Glad I waited for it to come out on dvd."
1861,Just Awesome. An epic conclusion of an epic storyline. Makes you both happy and sad. One of the best superhero movies ever.
1862,"Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, Avengers: Endgame does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga"
1863,"Even though I was able to predict the plot, this film was absolutely amazing. Incredible action, tear jerking & the perfect end to the Infinity Stone Arc. Only reason I didn't give it 10 stars was because 1 character I can't stand. Luckily they weren't in it much."
1864,"I usually don't write movie reviews but wanted to do for this one because this one was special and I found some reviews a bit misleading. Let me start by making it clear that infinity war is over! It ended;this is endgame-a conclusion rather than some big battle. Yes, there's definitely action in this one but as I said ""this is no war"". It has humour as well as depressing moments. Now a very important thing is that this movie is all about character arcs:turns, completions...so it's meaningless to watch it without watching previous movies. Now the main review: definitely engaging and emotional. It is a movie that dwells on its characters rather than big CGI battles. It has many intelligent and interesting moments. People who are going in expecting just epic battles without breaks will definitely be disappointed. So it's better to go it to enjoy the characters that have been developed over these years. Yes, it is a very big chapter for the mcu and a very satisfying end to a saga. Everybody can definitely enjoy it if they like mcu for its characters. I found some people complaining that this movie lacked action , infinity war was better and so on. I don't think I can tell which movie is better because both are very distinct (yet connected ) movies. Infinity war follows a warlike storyline whereas this movie prefers to deal with resulting catastrophic situations. This movie does have action but don't go expecting 'Infinity War'. It's the ""Endgame""-a conclusion."
1865,...................Why? ..........................why?? ...............................why??? .....and why????
1866,"I felt like my 10 year relationship had just ended.... but it was good, really good!"
1867,"I've been looking forward to this for so long, and it surpassed all my expectations. It is a thrilling ride, an emotional journey, and has comedic moments as well. It even causes tears to fall. I can't wait to watch it again."
1868,One word to describe Endgame: PERFECTION!!!! Im curios about Spiderman - Far from home!
1869,"I have been giving thoughts if I should still write about Avengers: Endgame. My brain is just blacked out. I cannot think of anything. Maybe because the movie left me broken after seeing it. And I'm afraid that if I try to remember the scenes from the movie, I might end up crying.[換行字元][換行字元]I felt sad after watching Infinity War, but Endgame just rips your heart out.[換行字元][換行字元]I was very silent after the movie. I went straight home after watching it. I can't handle it. I just watched the most anticipated movie of 2019 and the excitement and anticipation were replaced with too many emotions that is very impossible to contain. I thought I was ready to watch it, but I wasn't.[換行字元][換行字元]I haven't written a review that doesn't contain spoilers, so I would like this to be different. And it's really hard to write without spoiling the movie if the very core of the movie is how we are attached to the characters all over these years. We have been rooting for them for too long and seeing the conclusion of the franchise is giving us mixed emotions. All good feelings, I assure you but as I mentioned too much to contain.[換行字元][換行字元]I will watch it again, not to be broken again, but because this movie might be our last connection to the characters we ever love. (You'll know when you see the movie.)[換行字元][換行字元]I'm sending this warning to all MCU fans who haven't seen it. Be very ready for every possible and impossible thing that might happen because this movie will give you an emotional blow. You will clap. You will jump. You will shout. You will cheer. You will cry. And heck, you will weep. I know I did. #AvengersEndgame #EndgameReview"
1870,"End game is the best marvel film that i ever watched ! The only thing that I didn't like is the sequence of the story , it was a little bit bad However , thank you russo brothers for this two Masterpieces . It is the pattern for every coming superhero film ."
1871,"I'll keep it simple,[換行字元][換行字元]This movie is good. I give it a 7,4 but IW was better (I give IW a 8,9). The first half of the movie is kind of slow, the second half is faster.[換行字元][換行字元]You need to have seen a couple of marvel movies before you can understand what's going on in this movie. Or you have to have read the superheroes backgrounds and/or powers."
1872,"Well the Avengers series of the MCU left it all the screen in their Endgame. Despite a predictable end to the battle with Thanos, it brought a lot of great comedy and also a few tears. The movie didn't get of the best start, it picked itself up. It was interesting to see some of the blatant message in the climax, which threw me out of the movie for a second with an ""are you serious."""
1873,This is the first movie I would say is not made just for general audience
1874,It's over boring movie and wont reach the level of other marvel movies
1875,It deserves a solid 9 easy. Never cried that much since I lost my ham sandwich
1876,This is one of those rare movies that it seems pointless to write a review because its so good. In fact its so good finding something to criticize here will only make you look petty.
1877,"Bang on, perfect.[換行字元][換行字元]Everything I could of wanted[換行字元][換行字元]Sad but had to be done"
1878,"OUTSTANDING bittersweet end to a long cinematic saga brilliant performances by RDJ ,,,,,SCARJO,,,,,CHRIS EVANS .... Well done to all the cast crew and the writers and directors of this film for pulling this story of and giving us the best that the MCU HAS TO OFFER.... I only hope that i can continue to follow along for the next phase hopefully THE MCU WILL avoid the SJW crap, BUT i fear that, that is where we are heading its been a wild ride and this might be my last stop."
1879,"The Russo brothers' poignant, powerful finale more than lives up to the hype: It's a thrilling conclusion and a deeply emotional exploration of loss and love, duty and honor, friendship and family."
1880,"Incredible, touching, funny... Emotionally satisfying and intellectually stimulating. If you love these characters, you will love spending these three hours with them."
1881,"I have no words for how bittersweet this movie was. I'm not in the habit of spoilers so have no fear this review has none of them. I can say you'll be amazing, you'll laugh and of course you'll cry..but for me I'm kinda upset in a way like a bittersweet chocolate bar I really like but kinda I hate I ate way..lol. And I know these are fictional characters and I shouldn't be so invested but that's what Marvel and The Russo Brothers do..they have taken us on this journey with these characters and now it's like we're all hanging over this cliffside with them..not knowing where or how the journey will end knowing we probably won't looking away cause we love them. I just don't know if I can move on with the next phase.. theses dorks are my people and I think they outdone themselves this time."
1882,Exceptional! Run! Don't walk to see this movie! And don't let anyone tell you what happens in it before you see it.
1883,"This movie even with a 3 hour runtime does not fail, it keeps you hooked. It brings a lot of the characters story arch's to a great end, and opens the door for future films. This movie contains a great plot with great acting, it truly lives up to its potential."
1884,First of all the movie trailer doesn't show anything of the movie so you can't know what happens. This movie was the best way to celebrate much 10 years it contains great action beautiful end. And you stay in the seat in each second of the movie amazing movie .trust me go watch now
1885,"But this movie managed to make me do it twice with the emotional deaths.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is more story focused, but this is a benefit as it not only allows storylines to be tied up and for some fan service moments. The action is brilliant and the final fight is everything you could want from the ENDGAME!!!"
1886,This is a spoiler free review of my experience going to see avengers endgame In the Cenimas and a shot OutTo Disney for a job well done.[換行字元][換行字元]I think my reviews headline pretty much says it all Disney has thoroughly impressed me beyond measure With endgame and the 21 previous films leading up to it. I was never so excited for a films release in my Entire life I actually stayed up all night for this one to go watch it in IMAX 3D at my local AMC theater. Went to the 3 am screening something I wouldn't see myself easily going through for any other film. then I went to go see it once again 2 weeks later in 4DX at LA Live regal Cinemas in Los Angeles . 4DX is a very cool way of experiencing this movie one that I am so glad I invested into watching. The immersion technology Is truly epic and gets a big thumbs up from me. you can truly get to appreciate this film for all that it is in that format the added sensory effects really enhanced The experience which was already on of the best I can ever remember.[換行字元][換行字元]This film was nonstop action packed trillride that hit all the feels in spades I cried I laughed I cheered I was left on the edge of my seat in pulse pounding suspense and awe struck glory the entire time. I was like a kid in a toy store on Christmas morning with endless money in My pockets or something.[換行字元][換行字元]as for dislikes I can't find a single compliant with this film really other that then one perhaps With a Scene twoards the end. that i won't spoil other than by aying I didn't completely agree with. Because I thought of it as a feminist calling card moment against men but i could be i nterpreting it incorrectly to be fair. that said I'll leave my personal Opinions about That scene out of this other than what I've already written as it would probably take to long To explain detract too much From what is otherwise the best film ever and would probably offend Some people which is never my intention[換行字元][換行字元]Anyways folks if you haven't seen it already what are you waiting for ? it's definitely worth the 3 hours of your time and I highly recommend going to see it in the Cenimas while it's still playing you'll be glad that cha did. 😊
1887,"The movie it's awesome, spectacular, emotional, it's perfect, it's the end of an era."
1888,"This by far the best marvel movie I have ever watched, the emotions are strong, the battle was amazing, and when I watched it, i was shaking so much, and I couldn't breathe cuz of the fight scenes, and we lost some character's I won't say, but I cried!!, this movie is s must watch am telling you, it well be the best 3 hour and 2 mins of your life!"
1889,"An amazing movie, emotional, funny and with so much action! One of my favourite movies! It is worth watching! You have to see it!"
1890,Endgame is the ultimatest MCU Movie i've ever seen. Love it. Awesome.
1891,This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in my entire life!! It's the best super hero movie ever!! It deserves a lot of Oscars. It's just epic!!!
1892,"Breathtaking with lots of humor, emotion, and pure epicness! Marvel at his best![換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is a movie that fully has your attention from the beginning till till the end. The Russo Brothers did a outstanding job with an amazing amount of storytelling. Finally they bring all the pieces from the MCU Universe back together and we all get what we deserve. I only can tell you this; Before you watch Endgame, make sure you seen all the Marvel movies (chronologic order), it all makes sence. Besides that, Endgame also gave a great message to the real world, a message we can all learn from. Watch, enjoy and you discover it for yourself.[換行字元][換行字元]I hardly cannot believe Avengers is over. In my opinion the best Marvel movie ever made and a (tears) end of an amazing Era. Anthony and Joe Russo and Marvel Studios: Thanks you all for this amazing and epic journey!"
1893,ENDGAME is not a movie. It is an ultimate pay off to 11 years and 22 movies.
1894,"This movie was soo epic. You're not ready for this movie and therefore the epic conclusion of more than 10 years. Tears will be shed, laughing will happen because this movie has everything. That's why it's a 10/10! See for yourself!"
1895,This movie is worth every Penny. Best Marvel movie ever. Starts little slow but it gradually improve the pacing of the movie.
1896,"That's it, not even a drop of sense on this one. They completely ruined Thanos Hulk and Thor and after that they dug a hole so deep and had no idea what to do with it. I don't even want to write anymore because the more I think the worse it gets.. they rushed this one too fast. With so many possibilities to do it, it's really sad to end an era like this."
1897,One of best movies I have ever seen. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I loved every aspect of this movie.
1898,"I was ecstatic-- So ecstatic to see this film. But after just watching it. Honestly I don't know what to feel...[換行字元][換行字元]The first 2+ hours was a snail's pace. I felt there were too much unnecessary dialogues. And being true to heart of watching all the Marvel movies, this one made me yawn at least 3 times.[換行字元][換行字元]The ""good stuff"" only came towards the last hour. But even then the action sequences wasn't THAT great in comparison to Infinity War. It was a brief good entertainment to say the least...[換行字元][換行字元]I believed the writers were trying to make it more of a sentimental kind of superhero movie instead. Which, don't get me wrong, it's a nice approach. As there were some touching moments and it can definitely bring out the tears (mostly likely affecting the sensitive folk) ... I just felt it was a tad bit much (emotion > action). Maybe a nice balance of emotion and action would do be more suiting, as I've always felt this ""balance"" in the previous Avenger movies.[換行字元][換行字元]All-in-all, it was still a good movie. Not that great as typically people would expect (from the overhype and all). The ending was a real nice touch to the franchise. Now THAT brought on the water-works. Salute to that![換行字元][換行字元]So thank you--- thank you to all those who've worked on Endgame. I believed you tried your very best and though it didn't satisfied me fully. It still left others happy, overall. So people, do give it a watch. As there's still some worth in it. *Salutes*"
1899,"This movie is everything. It's funny, sad, heartbreaking, heartwarming, and so amazing. Stunning visuals and storyline, Endgame is basically a must watch and it was a wonderful experience for me watching it."
1900,"This movie is the best climax oh marvel cenematic universe ! All i can say about the movie is that go and watch, bcoz this mivie deserves to broke all the records.it is imotional,funny,thrilling,there was everythimg in the movie !"
1901,Infinity war was amazing... this... nope. Hollyweird just doesn't know how to finish a story anymore. Paint by numbers and submit to a committee. Was it bad? No. Was it good? No. Robert Downey Junior is the only good thing in this film.
1902,"This is not just a movie its full of emotions.You gonna laugh you gonna cry you gonna cheer.Its everything you are all waiting for, Just wanna say thank you to marvel studios for making this possible."
1903,"Their won't be no more waiting for the greatest fans in the world including me...whoever comes and goes those actors character will always remembered in our heart...this movie made us laugh, cry and more than that showed us how to love a movie... Whatever we think that's gonna happen in this movie just the opposite will be showcased...this film is outstanding the final scenes in this movie is mind-blowing... Just enjoy.. No words to describe... Chris Evans (Captain America) and Robert Downey Jr. (Iron man) love u beyond this film..thank uuuu..."
1904,"Avengers: Endgame actually manages to keep audiences pumped and delivered the thrills and action as expected. Here we see our favorite heroes coping with their losses during Infinity War, and how their ragtag team assemble for one final chance to get things right. Of course there are risks, and Thanos, being a true menace, we are always on edge to see how events will play out in the end. There probably is no individual character arc, but we do see a collective arc in the evolution of the Avengers as a team. We also get to see our favorite heroes back in action, and Thanos as Thanos being Thanos (trying not to spoil anything here). In fact, I thought 3 hours runtime would be agonizing but it felt like any 90 minute movie. The first act seemed a bit slow, but the second act gets our pulses thumping because we saw what had happened to half our heroes the last time, and the third act is an epic battle worthy of all the wait. There is a balance between drama, action, and comedy. However, for me the action scenes are brilliant and the Russo brother manages to show the capabilities of our heroes in full. As part of a massive narrative, it works perfectly. But as a stand alone movie, you will not get the full experience. That said, I wonder what's next for the Avengers."
1905,"Let me preface this by saying Endgame was awesome. Considering this movie had to wrap up 21 previous movies while still leaving room for future adventures, I'd wager that very few could've pulled it off like the Russos did.[換行字元][換行字元]If I have one overlying complaint of the movie, it would have to be pacing. Most people say the beginning half was too slow, but in my opinion it was actually too fast. I rarely say this about a movie for any reason other than wanting extra content, but this movie needed to be 4 hours long at least. There's just so much happening within these 3 hours that it doesn't even feel like 3 hours. Most of the legitimate criticisms I've seen stem from this, and it's really my only complaint. The fan service didn't strike me as a negative at all, I thought it was done very well. All in all this was an exceptional movie, and the main problem I have with it basically boils down to ""I wanted more""."
1906,"Perfect conclusion to the 22 film saga satisfyingly wraps up several characters' multi-film arcs, while opening up possibilities for several others; that said, it's not without its faults, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly."
1907,"The movie is great, but not the best marvel movie to date. If you mix Infinity war + the last 1 hour of this movie, you actually get a masterpiece movie (10/10). In the 2 first hours, the movie was slow, and it felt more like a tribute to the 10 years of the marvel universe. I guess they wanted to connect the fans with the older movies. The last hour was excellent, and the action exceeded expectation. Of course, there are some holes in the plot, but Marvel does not let us down. Once again, another movie that Marvel fans won't forget easily."
1908,"This movie has everything. Comedy, action and tear at your heart strings. An all around superb movie. Absolutely well directed and the actors were bringing their A game. You have got to see this movie. If you saw Infinity War this movie is the icing on the cake."
1909,The Russo brothers knocked one out of the park with this movie! Sign them up for movies within the Star Wars franchise. Marvel tied a beautiful bow with this movie in order to wrap up the Avengers series.
1910,"Warning: This movie will exceed your expectation!!![換行字元][換行字元]Marvel has quite mastered the art of story-telling![換行字元][換行字元]The trailer has been teasing us with pretty much nothing and what a way to promote Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]In the rarity of today's world, where most trailers almost tell you everything in 3 minutes.[換行字元][換行字元]This review is about to reveal nothing just like the trailer did other than what an epic conclusion!![換行字元][換行字元]Tears 7/10 Intrigue 9/10 Mystery 8.5/10 Ending 9.5/10[換行字元][換行字元]p.s. There is no post end credit scene. Save yourself 10 minutes of time."
1911,"The MCU movies have been not just about the storyline they portray. They were the last frontline of cinema in times of on demand tv shows, at least from my recent experiences at the movies in a rural area of Germany. People setting alarm clocks for ticket sales and sitting through double/triple features after midnight, this is when movie magic really happens for me and I fear that this is the culmination and the end of this kind of cinematic culture. Nothing like this has been done before and it is uncertain if we will ever see such an epic journey of interwoven films again like this.[換行字元][換行字元]This is a thank you to anyone involved in the creation of these film, since I am grateful for this experience and always was looking forward to the next chapter in this story. I hope there will be more stories like this to be told on the big screen, but I fear nothing will ever compare to the excitement before watching endgame in the midnight screening. This is what great moviemaking looks like and my wife and I laughed, cheered and cried along the way. Thank you for this masterpiece!"
1912,"A thoroughly entertaining film which ticks all the boxes. A surefire sign that the film works is that despite being very long, the pace is perfect and keeps the viewer engaged throughout.[換行字元][換行字元]The script is witty but never frivolous. The plot works well and is not overly complicated.[換行字元][換行字元]The final chapters are a worthy conclusion to the franchise and are genuinely emotional.[換行字元][換行字元]Highly recommended."
1913,"The entire cinema, even the annoying little kids that clearly should not have been there on the first day lol- gasped, laughed, cried throughout the entire film. It was insane, it was emotional, it was gripping, it was sentimental, it was EPIC and it was PERFECT. I am so completely and utterly satisfied.[換行字元][換行字元]I have just no words for Endgame, I watched it 12 hours ago and am still processing that sheer brilliance. I have already planned my Round 2 watch! It deserves more than 10 stars, Russo Brothers' did an amazing job at balancing this movie with just about everything that it needed and left nothing to imagination.[換行字元][換行字元]I am a huge bollywood stan and am used to 3 hour feature-length films, but Endgame had me looking at my phone in what felt like only an hour...but in fact 2.5 hours had already passed!!!"
1914,Left the movie in chock.....a good kind of chock😁
1915,"Just watched the movie. Despite my best wishes, I simply cannot find myself singing praises to such a poorly-done movie. Ranging from the grossly obvious CGI to the poorly written-out story line, Endgame is extremely underwhelming. Throughout the movie I found myself sitting in utter disbelief as to how Endgame went so wrong after a fantastic Infinity War."
1916,Favourite movie. Film yg sangat membuat saya terharu dan berdecak kagum.
1917,"Can't be expressed by words. THIS IS EPIC, Y'ALL MUST WATCH"
1918,The beast!the best one!....................................................
1919,It is very difficult to put in words how you will feel after seeing this movie; but you must. It is absolutely perfection.
1920,Spectacular film. Spectacular performances. Not just a great superhero movie but a great movie all round. The Russo's smashed it.
1921,"People are silly when they say they dont like it. There is admittedly a lot to unpack here. I personally am going to have to watch it at least two more times to catch everything. But I loved it, it was a sincere practical ending. I'm glad it went down this way"
1922,"No one goes to see a comic book movie expecting to see an art house film. It happens sometimes but it is not the normal. What you expect to see is a fun movie with some philosophical concept and some emotional depth, comic books were never just about the action. So is this a great film? I don't care. Watching it I never stopped to think if there are plot holes or if the cinematography is good, I just enjoyed it. And enjoyed almost everything about it. The Russo brothers are not the new Goddard or the new Bergman (or even the new Spielberg) but they are talented and intellectual people, they had a goal and they delivered by not only doing fan service but also story service. The MCU has a great future.[換行字元][換行字元]So, is it a great film? Comparing it with cinematic masterpieces I could give it a 6-7/10. Comparing it with other blockbuster movies I could give it a 12/10, it's that good..."
1923,See it!! Its the best superhero movie of all time.. dont miss it!
1924,This was the worst movie from the whole series. I'm disappointed.
1925,Thanx Marvel for doing such art and make it exists.
1926,"Three hours of fun. It is worth every penny to see this movie. I saw plenty of action and there were some tearful moments, too. GO SEE IT!"
1927,"Watched it in 4DX. Premiere morning. This film makes me happy, sad, gives me peace and anger at the same time. It's a new caliber of superheroes movie. 3 hours means nothing.[換行字元][換行字元]As other marvel films, the sound, the effect and CGI is a top class. Story wise, yes we will find some minor loophole, and yes, it's argueable, but I can't think of any major plot hole that can makes me hates this film. Especially it's a film that conclude all previous films.[換行字元][換行字元]If you feeling happy, angry, sad or peace, believe me we are did.. and that's why this film is amazing and beautiful. A film that truly 11/10. It's a no brainer if you think and feel the same as me."
1928,"I don't wanna spoil anything but god damn ..this was amazing, funny, dramatic, sad, action packed...everything about it was just perfect.. The 3 hours went by like they were nothing. And im gonna go watch it again on Friday because this was a emotion roller coaster and i need more of if."
1929,"The best film of the year so far. You must watch this film in an imax, also the imax illustration is incredible."
1930,This movie is amazing! Its a must see movie! Please watch this movie it has so much fun and exciting things in it.
1931,"Its kind of sad it end here. Its so graceful that the end game doing an amazing work as usual Avengers does . And It does even the best among all. Just a super experieances to be in the cinema watching this . The audios are actually cheers and clap all the times while the movie is playing . Its a wonderful moment of all time !! What a Great work for the Hero movies like this , like all !"
1932,"Well, this has been what we all have been waiting for quite some time now. 10 years in making, characters we grew find of and vast and complex storylines. They all have ended up to this movie. I wanted to watch this movie on the opening night and couldn't wait to get in. As someone who has been following the Marvel universe fairly thoroughly and watched almost all of the movies leading to this one multiple times, to be honest, I wasn't blown away. The problem for me was that while I was enjoying the movie, I couldn't help but to realize this is going to be THE last one, so all of a sudden I wasn't that impress with the way many scenes were being handled. Especially, when you compare it to some of the other Marvel movies which were fantastic. If I were to single out one problem, it would be poor writing. I don't know whether they had time issue or spmething else but the material is so weak and the dialogues are so forgettable and superficial that were robbing the beauty out of the fantastic visual effects and sound effects and acceptable directing and casting. There were numerous occasions I was literally yearning for a killer line by the characters to hit me write in the heart and lingers with me for the rest of my life but the magic was far far from there. It was weird in a sense that they have already had many splendid writings in the Marvel movies to this date but why the most important chapter (the finale) should be like this is truly astonishing. All in all, it is not a bad movie in any ways but for the folks who have been following the Marvel movies seriously or semi-seriously, you will be a little disappointed that why this potential has been wasted in this way."
1933,"I know many DC deek riders will disagree but Endgame is definitely much better than Nolan Trash knight and any other superhero movies. Direction was perfect, A Perfect end, 11 years journey was ended in just 3 hours, Ending 8 minutes was totally unexpected. Every superhero fan should watch this movie actually it's not a superhero movie it will give you some Life lesson. Genius will get this👍"
1934,"Endgame brings my childhood back to life, brings me tears actually. Remembering playing with all the action figures of all the Avengers & others in the early 90's, seeing all the mcu movies, the Russo's brought this legendary era to a perfect conclusion. All your hopes & dreams will be fulfilled. If you follow these comics you'll feel like a kick again & really become attached to these characters over the last 10 years. This movie truly is bittersweet. I wish it wouldn't end but like Downey Jr./Stark said, ""part of the journey is the end."""
1935,Best marvel movie ever...... ............ ............
1936,This movie was complicated and weird. The child friendly Barney/Thanos started attacking random hero's like iron man and other people. I found this very odd because Barney teaches us to have fun but he is ending other people's fun. This was complicated because they kept on referring to Barney as Thanos which made it difficult to understand what was happening.
1937,"Even though Avengers: Endgame wasn't a perfect movie, I still found it to be a satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga. Most of the performances were great, the story was epic and emotional, and the action sequences were well-done. Right now, I'm not sure if this is my favorite MCU movie or not. While Infinity War was more consistently good, Endgame had better moments. Overall, I would highly recommend this movie. However, I think you should watch the previous 21 MCU movies at least once to get maximum enjoyment from Endgame."
1938,"This is it this is epic this is emotional this is everything we want in movies, yes this is it"
1939,Amazing movie. I really enjoyed it. it had a lot of avengers assembling to beat the mad titan THANOS
1940,I don't have to think twice to say this movie is the best movie I ever watched .
1941,"First off, I am a fan boy and lifelong comic lover. With that said, this movie was personal to me and truly felt like watching my family on the screen. Marvel Studios and Disney did such an amazing job piecing so many movies together to get us here. The anticipation was huge and properly met. This movie was epic and although it had some plot holes, mostly intentional I think, the closure so many characters reached (as well as the loyal fan base with this being the epic conclusion to the Avengers Saga) makes it a true, emotional rollercoaster of a masterpiece! This was everything I hoped for and had plenty of surprises fans hadn't guessed. Great movie and I will rewatch this time and time again!"
1942,"Wow , first time to stay 3 hours long in the cinema . It's quite an experience in IMAX with laser . Movie is alright , just like what i expected . But 50 USD worth ticket per one is insane !"
1943,Little bit sad but overall I love the ending. Its worth for 3 hrs watching.
1944,"For the disappointed fans, please bear in mind that it took 22 movies over 11years to make this happened. And you thought it was easy to suit everyone's liking? With some saying that the characters were ruined in this movie. It's 5 years later and you expected Thor to keep his shape. That's 5 years of guilt that he had to go through. Hulk didn't get even throw a punch in this movie? Come on, man. He had enough screen time to make his character shine. It's the story that builds up the action not action builds up the story. And that is 22 films into this major plot. Have we ever seen anything like this in movie history??? You should at least be thankful that this is happening in your lifetime. I'm giving a 8/10 for the movie and another +2 for everyone that made this happened over the the last 11years. Would you have better plan to make this movie in a period of 3hours? Then do it yourself!"
1945,This movie is better than joker. Hm.. Totally suckss. Couldn't understand a single thing.
1946,"I think the movie is selling only due to it's predecessors, most of whom were built with great care and vision. action wise, infinity war was way ahead of this slow paced dashed hope. only relief at the end is that thankfully it's over and they can now focus on movies with one or two superheroes at max."
1947,You don't have to be a solid fan of marvel comics to enjoy every film they made. I just enjoy every bit of the movie.
1948,"I saw this in the theater, It was awesome, and just when you think it can't any better it does..."
1949,"Masterpiece , Awesome , best movie of the decade 🙏🙏🙏🙏"
1950,"End Game holds the same epic scale as Infinity War but with everything the first part lacked. This time around, the Russo's provide a more personal, character driven-tale filled with important character moments that I felt Infinity War severely lacked. As a result, despite the stakes being lower in this instalment, I was 10x more invested in the story and action and I truly worried for our heroes this time round.[換行字元][換行字元]Our two main hero's, Cap and Tony, are definitely at their best here, despite their tensions from Civil war being brushed aside a little too quickly. The two actors are masters of these roles right now and all of their work pays off, with both characters seeing incredibly satisfying ends by the film's climax. Not to mention, other returning hero's also have satisfying, but admittedly controversial arcs, like Banner and Thor (who isn't as interesting as he was in Infinity war, but is still much better than the pre-Ragnarok rendition of the character).[換行字元][換行字元]Because of the more personal story, the action feels less noisy and instead more tense and satisfying, with the final battle being by far the best that the series has offered.[換行字元][換行字元]While Thanos takes a back seat in this film, he still remains menacing in his moments onscreen and an incredible motivator for our heroes that we've come to love over the years.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, End Game improves every weak aspect of Infinity War, and acts as a perfect conclusion to the Infinity saga."
1951,"A great film in all respects, specifically emotional"
1952,The CGI part is messy but the Avenger lovers would like it.
1953,Best series i have ever seen with a perfect ending. 3000 love for average film.
1954,"Well, I finally got around to watching ""Avengers: Endgame"", even though I already watched ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"", so I already knew some of the events that were to transpire in ""Avengers: Endgame"". And I am not really fond of the superhero genre, but I still watch the movies when given the chance, as they are usually visually fantastic and provide adequate entertainment. And of course with all the hype that ""Avengers: Endgame"" had gotten, of course I just had to sit down and watch it.[換行字元][換行字元]First of all, the movie was long. A little bit too long actually. I did feel that directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo were taking their sweet time getting to the core of the storyline, and just dancing around the bushes. In my opinion, the movie did suffer from this.[換行字元][換行字元]Visually, well let's just go with 'wow'. Yeah, the movie was phenomenally stunning to look at visually given the CGI and special effects. But of course, being a Marvel movie, then you'd have top of the line special effects. And it is the visuals that carry the superhero movies quite a long way down the road.[換行字元][換行字元]Story-wise, then I felt that the plot and storyline portrayed in ""Avengers: Endgame"" was a little bit too predictable and too generic. You already knew the movie's outcome when you sat down to watch it. Of course, Marvel weren't going to kill off a heap of their most beloved characters. No chance of that happening. So there weren't really much of any surprises along the way. And the time traveling aspect of the movie? Seriously? That was just downright idiotic.[換行字元][換行字元]What worked for the movie, aside from the great visuals, was the impressive ensemble of actors and actresses that made an appearance in bigger or smaller parts throughout the course of the movie. Thumbs up for that. However, I found some of the dialogue to be a bit too corny and felt that it was written for a young audience.[換行字元][換行字元]Was ""Avengers: Endgame"" a fulfilling closure to the Marvel storyline? Hardly so. The movie, while being entertaining enough, felt a bit shallow, with parts of the story quite poorly written. But if you, like me, come to the superhero movies mostly for the special effects, then ""Avengers: Endgame"" will definitely blow you away.[換行字元][換行字元]All in all, I am rating ""Avengers: Endgame"" a six out of ten stars."
1955,"Epic conclusion, really enjoy all the mcu movie... Definitely must see Amazing ,emotional movie[換行字元][換行字元]Love it"
1956,"I am not a typical science fiction movie fan but i love movie as long as it has good story, graphics and can make me feel become part of movie.[換行字元][換行字元]After having watched Endgame i was literally in shock due to emotions i felt. even a sane person like me who know the difference between real life and reel life cried, smiled, laughed and man!! those goosebumps i felt during some science where Avengers get hope of success were incredible.[換行字元][換行字元]Yes i agree first part of movie was not that fast but it was great since it built a pavement for bigger building, and also make us feel how heartbroken a man feel when he fails to save his loved once after trying everything.

1957,"You really think this movie is one of the greatest movies all-time? Better than Forrest Gump, Inception, and The Matrix? You must be joking!!"
1958,Absolute trash!! The ending was terrible I felt like there was no closure there was so many mistakes it was sooooo cheesy and the storyline was absolute trash. We deserved so much better. Nothing will top infinity war this was an insult. It had its moments but there was very few
1959,"Failure with no purpose , and the rating is all about fans"
1960,Mind-blowing man what an end You people are gonna love this😍😍 There are fight scenes which are amazing and the jokes 😂😂 and the emotional scenes which will make people cry 😭😭😭 Overall I give 10/10 for this movie Great effort by the Russo brothers and the cast and the whole team dedicated to do this film
1961,"Took a while to process my thoughts and gather words. Still haven't recovered from the existential crisis this film caused because I don't feel like wanting anything anymore because I feel like it gave me everything I needed.

1962,Infinity war is 1000 times way better. Infinity war is 1000 times way better.
1963,One of the best Sci fi movie of all time.. end of an Era for great Tony Stark.
1964,"Among all of The Avengers movies, I think this is the greatest movie of the entire series."
1965,"Can't ignore the truth that this is a super hero film! While except the last several minute, other plots can attract any attention. Can't even compare with Avengers: Infinity War! Narrative thread and music disordered throughout 3-hour movie."
1966,Mindblowing ending :)[換行字元][換行字元]Cant wait to see What happens If an new avengers movie comes out :)
1967,"It's 10 years of beautiful moments and memories marvel brings to us. Movie is full of emotional moments. Anyway, it's beyond ""film"" it's just life itself."
1968,Could have been better!!! marvel has a toxic fan base people freak out on lame jokes in the movie whenever something is going in with a good flow! Terrible CGi overrated poor storyline could've been better!
1969,"Worth it. 11 years and 21 movies later, the journey was an unforgettable one. The emotions conveyed on my face have not done justice to this epic finale. What are you sitting and reading this for ? Go and watch the zenith of Marvel Comics come to life."
1970,"After The Davastaed Events Of Last Year's Avengers infinity War Saw All Of Marvel's Awesome And Cool Superheroes Which includes Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Maria Hill, Nick Fury, Star-Lord, Drax The Destroyer, Mantis, Groot, Scarlet Witch,Vision, Black Panther, The Wasp, The Winter Soldier And The Falcon All Turn To Dust And Ashes By a Snap From The Mad Titan Himself Thanos After He Collected All Six infinity Stones in His Gauntlet....

Anyways Avengers Endgame is Truly One Of The Best And Perhaps The Greatest Final Avengers Film Of All Time With Action-Packed Moment Scenes, it's a Little Bit Of Emotional At Times Epespecially Since The Scene That involves Black Widow Who Scarifices Herself To Retrieve The Soul Stone And Avengers Endgame Has Great Humor Moments As Well. P.S. This Final Avengers Film Goes Out To The Great Late Stan Lee And For All Of His Cameo Appreances in Every Marvel Superhero Movie That He Started in."
1971,"Let be honest here, after infinity war marvel really had a lot to live up to, and they simply set the bar to high. There were several missed chances to provide fans with a truly epic conclusion. The entire thing felt rushed. The story felt rushed and not well thought out. To be honest I'm just really really upset. I took part of the day off to sneak out and go see this movie without my wife because i was confident i would see it again with her, but i don't think i can sit through that again. It kinda felt like the last star wars, or the solo movie disney did. They simply ran out of gas. The take off was spectacular but there just wasn't enough gas in the tank to bring it home."
1972,I can't describe my disappointment. The movie was very boring with predictable happy end.
1973,It was everything for me. The way they linked all the ends was marvelous. I found all the happiness and sadness at the same time. Love you Iron man 3000. And now we all do know who's Captain. And sadest thing was to lose widow. And I still love Red witch She was incredible. At the end Thank You Marvel.
1974,"There must be a lot of brainless fan boys highly rating this movie ... compared to its predecessor (Infinity War) Endgame was a real let down. I won't reveal spoilers. But I will say the pacing was very bad.... very very slow at the start to the point I was nodding off in the theatre .... the movie before had great pacing of action, drama and comedy...... Endgames first half was just boring. Also balance of heroes in the first movie was done much better than this movie which really should have been called Captain America & Iron Man + Avengers. And time travel as a plot device is a very lazy way of solving issues ... I cringed when that came up ........ Thanos and his lieutenants were a threat in Infinity War... in this movie they felt really dumbed down."
1975,"The first two-thirds of the movie is very inventive. Swinging from bleak to It plays around with the narrative and the concept of time in this story. This slow burn, full of trademark MCU humor, is unpredictable and welcome."
1976,Awesome time travel story with lot of emotions and an epic fight
1977,"The movie drags on at points and the beginning and goes into some tropes that create problems.[換行字元][換行字元]Feels like a clear step back in character writing for the villains, excellent final act and epilogue.[換行字元][換行字元]Infinity war is ultimately the superior movie."
1978,"Try as did to like Endgame , the pace was poor, script nonsensical and apart from a few laughs, won't be going to watch it again like Infinity War. At times it was embarrassing to sit through it. Especially the ending. One to forget."
1979,"Endgame - it is here. And it is bigger, stronger and more exciting then ever.[換行字元][換行字元]Prepare to get your mind blown and hold on to your seats. This movie is a wild one as you probably expect. You will get a few decent laughs. A dozen of epic sequences and big reveals. That will even shatter the long debates between hardcore what could happen or who can do what.[換行字元][換行字元]Some characters will change in unexpected ways and will make you laugh more than you will probably expect.[換行字元][換行字元]It will go for three hours and you will not want it to stop."
1980,The movie was ok. I seen it yesterday. First 2.5 hrs is no action or fighting at all. The last 30 mins was a big fight. Captain marvel showed up in beginning of movie and the end. I def couldn't watch it again for 3 hrs
1981,Avengers: Infinity War better than this movie. A film that cannot meet expectations.
1982,I just want to say how amazing this film is from start to finish. This will take you on a emotional ride.[換行字元][換行字元]You will not he disappointed
1983,"Super Duper Blockbuster of the year.. but sad to hear that the legends will not able to join the next MCU movies. Emotional Endings and as we say for Marvel ""Every ending is a new beginning"".[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you!"
1984,I've never written a review on IMDB before. Im writing this today to describe how incredible of a viewing experience this movie truly is. Your life cannot be fully lived if you have not watched this movie. It is the greatest cinematic masterpiece in regards to bringing closure to a series I have ever witnessed. I'm glad to have lived during the time this movie was created.
1985,"I have seen a lot and I mean A LOT of movies and nothing beats this movie !!! Holy hell !! I mean just absolutely loved this movie !! The movie just is flawless ! It had me at the edge of my seat, had me crying like a baby (non spoiler), the acting from everyone was absolutely flawless and Josh Brolin as Thanos was AMAZING !!! THIS MOVIE DESERVES 100000 STARS !!!! I know it's my opinion but anyone who thinks this movie was not at least good just wants to be famous for trolling cause this movie is beautiful !!!"
1986,"This is the best action movie I have ever seen. If you are a Marvel fan, you have to watch it. Whatever it takes! If Marvel movies are not your things, you still enjoy the movie with those action scenes. One day, I will tell my children that I have lived at the right time with legends, and I have seen it."
1987,"After all the hype I was convinced it couldn't top the last one. I was wrong. Aside from personally not liking the direction they went with one character, I have literally 0 complaints. It's wonderful. Go see it."
1988,"Amazing ending for the avengers! Although my favourite was the Ironman, it was nice to sacrifice for the good of all the others. It was an epic and heroic ending for him. I liked a lot the humor of hulk and especially Thor. Also I enjoyed the fights between Thanos and avengers. There were not overpowered scenes. Every little thing was perfect !!! Undoubtedly this movie movie deserves a 10/10 Bravo bravo bravo!!!"
1989,"Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie. It made me smile, cry, laugh, feel anxious and somewhat annoyed by the fact that the theater decide to show me a trailer of the new Spiderman letting me know in that way that he doesn't die in endgame (which was kind of a spoiler but not really).[換行字元][換行字元]The movie was great but I won't give it anything more that an 8/10. It still is a superhero movie even though it is supposed to be the grand finale. Women should be more involved and know that I say this without feeling like a feminist (I'm a guy). Captain Marvel only shows up for like half an hour max (of the total 3 hours the movie goes on for).[換行字元][換行字元]Another point is deducted due to the fact that the creators bend the limits of reality. Time travel has some consequences that sometime worked out and others didn't with the latter being like that only to progress the plot exactly how Marvel wanted it.[換行字元][換行字元]Bottom line, terrific acting and even though it isn't said as much as it should, a long round of applause for the staff especially the CGI team."
1990,"This movie dosent deserve to be this high on IMDb,it was bring and by far the worst avengers movie with a disapointing and predictable outcome,it ruined thanos and the heroes one with no casualties like every superhero movie,endgame was by far the worst most overrated marvel movie"
1991,"Couldn't have asked for anything more, what and ending to a great 11 years of cinema. Leaves you feeling imotionally drained, and wanting to watch it all Over again"
1992,"This movie lives up to the hype, fantastic directing and story telling.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie lifts some of the most iconic moments in the Marvel Universe straight from the comic page.[換行字元][換行字元]Roll on the next 11 years of Marvel Magic!"
1993,"This is the greatest MCU movie ever done,and even if there are some mistakes on the development of the plot,I loved this movie because it gives a beautiful conclusion at the MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]Russo' bros did a great job,because they managed to develop a lot of different characters in a movie without being banal. Personally I didn't appreciate fat thor and a bit hulk,but I understand that they have done that to evolve those characters."
1994,This is the best Movie. I enjoyed the film very much and appreciate.
1995,"This movie rounds up the story for every single character in the series, leaving you with no holes, no regrets, no nothing but tears of joy, sadness and fullfilment. This is an amazing movie, especially if you have watched the remainter of the series, and also most other newer Marvel movies. Enjoy."
1996,"A movie that celebrates the lat 11 years of Marvel Movies, focusing on the first avengers and making you feel happy, sad and nostalgic in 3 hours long."
1997,The movie is not even worth half the rating it has got! It should be 3 or 4
1998,"They robbed us with the last move, for goodbye! It is all about the money!"
1999,Hell yes! The inner comic buff in me was screaming out the whole time.
2000,The most epic movie i've ever watced. Perfect!!! It was way better that i expected especially the fight scene!!! 10/10 Masterpiece
2001,"Endgame is the Culmination of 21 movies over 3 phases in a span of 11 years. And what a conclusion it was. The Story arc for the main characters have been beautifully completed in this one and also setting up new arcs for other characters. This film will definitely fulfill all the expectations of the fans of the movie and even the comic books. It has moments of laughter, joy, and utter thrill. Mixed with emotional ones too. When dealing with time travel the directors have an immense task of not screwing it up. Nonetheless, Russos have kept it clean and slick even though it leaves a few plotholes. But, this surely is their greatest work, yet. And onw of the best movies to have ever come out in cinema history."
2002,It was good but not great. The first hour is way to long. A nice ending and a good attempt with a lot of old references.
2003,Too many plot holes. The first 90 minutes were really slow. The next 90 minutes were too rushed. Infinity war was wayyyyy better.
2004,"For some reasons I didnt find it as good as its predecessor. Story was average ,at some point it felt it is not moving at all. Linking movie with the pre sequels is very bad specially for those who are watching Marvel movie for the first time. Acting is by far the best from all the characters and bringing back all the characters together in one movie was a great task by Marvel Universe. All in all this movie is not for non-marvel fan. If you have been an ardent fan of Marvel Universe ,this sure will be a joy ride."
2005,Long. Very very long. May have rated it it higher if an hour or so shorter?
2006,I mean what is there to say other than wow this movie is just incredible. WOW
2007,"This movie is the best marvel have ever made.[換行字元][換行字元]A 3 hour masterpiece , don't read the reviews just go see it ."
2008,"I'm going to try and keep this short and to the point as I have a tendency to get carried away when I'm excited...[換行字元][換行字元].....no Spoiler's here.[換行字元][換行字元]To sum 'End Game' up in one word, I will say - EPIC! And I really mean epic in every sense of the word. This. Film. Is. EPIC!!! The Russo brothers have succeeded in delivering an ending that feels deserved. It seriously pays off. There are so many references and call-backs to the films that have now spand 10+ years that show these two film maker's are trully passionate about these character's and telling their stories in the most satisfying ways. Trying not to sound cliche here - the film really IS a love letter to the fans. End Game is an epic (I know I've said ""epic"" a lot), engrossing, superhero extravaganza that will go down in film history as a masterpiece! I can confidently say that this is the best superhero film ever made! Not sure if Marvel can or will ever reach these heights again but one thing is certain - I will still be around for the ride ;)"
2009,The last scene of this movie is wonderful! I want to see this movie again because it is a master piece
2010,"The Russos couldn't have subverted our expectations in a better way. Simply, because they didn't give a hoot about our expectations. Instead, they gave us a a continuation of Infinity War with a most unexpected conflict. In other words, they went for the head; all we cared about are the stones.[換行字元][換行字元]They also proved that they understand every character in this universe better than anyone. They delved into their minds and hearts in a way fans ever hoped and fancied. They truly fleshed out our beloved avengers by showing them as more humans exactly as we felt about them at every important moment in every movie in the MCU. They convinced us that these characters really experienced these moments, and thus cared about them as much as we do. The incredible cast, who are at the top of their game, couldn't have complemented what the Russos did for their characters more perfectly.[換行字元][換行字元]Whilst the unique storytelling of Infinity War never feels ""cinematic"", I absolutely loved it with its epic quality and how I felt that I was flipping pages of a graphic novel instead of watching a movie. The Russos used once again the same exceptional style of narration here, except that, to my surprise, it feels as ""cinematic"" as it gets! I have absolutely no clue how they have managed to do such a thing, but what I know is that this made me realize that Infinity War is flawed, especially in this aspect, way more than I thought. Everything here works twice as good as it did in Infinity War: comedy and drama. Also, this made the fast pacing don't come at the expense of the cohesiveness of the story.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie did make it a bit easy for itself sometimes (and we can see that in certain decisions that some character took, and a couple of things that are quite perfunctory that they could have gone deeper with), but the movie also took three thousand risks that entangled itself in what could have an endless loop of nonsensical chaos only to serve the franchise's fans, and it did as good as it gets.[換行字元][換行字元](9/10)"
2011,"Greetings from Lithuania.[換行字元][換行字元]""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) was funny, a bit sad, very entertaining, spectacular and maybe a bit too long for me personally. I did enjoy this movie from start till finish though, and while its not my personal favorite from them all, this was a very solid movie in my opinion (and i'm not a huge fan of these movies to start with, so tears haven't been found during my watch).[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, ""Avengers: Endgame"" brings half of the Hollywood famous actors into one big, entertaining 3 hours (!) long escapism. At the end i enjoyed this film much more then i thought i will be."
2012,"It is overrated movie - and not in the same level as infinity war. I think the two movies could have been merged into one 3 hrs movie and spare us the hype of 13 years old fans all over the world.[換行字元][換行字元]It is not worth it.[換行字元][換行字元]Most of the parts are slow paced and dull, and the action sequences are not new or even surprising.[換行字元][換行字元]Full of cinematic cliches."
2013,"Marvel, since under Disney management, fails in innovating and goes for the safe route of recycling its blockbusters. The movie feels like a weird mix of burger, pizza, skittles and Ben&Jerries. Very disappointing of Marvel."
2014,This movie we waiting for years. Those how how are full of spolier are show the movie before it releasing. Do something about it. This type of people watched this movie on a small screen on mobile.
2015,"Please keep in mind that this score is coming from a person who is NOT a fan and that this is still a generally positive review.[換行字元][換行字元]For the first time for me, I must credit the Disney front office, and especially Feige, for pulling off one of the most ambitious projects in film history. It has become clear to me that this entire 22 Marvel movie series beginning with Iron Man was taken very seriously by everyone involved, and while I respect the directors' visions for each movie, having the oversight over the entire Marvel project was what really made the franchise an unprecedented success.[換行字元][換行字元]Now that being said, onto the movie itself. I'll avoid spoilers, so I'll just say I came out feeling just whelmed for this movie. Unlike Infinity War, Endgame felt more like the typical Marvel movie to me, and that means for negatives it suffered from some pacing issues for the sake of exposition, its music especially during more lowkey scenes felt uninspired, and emotional scenes felt very subdued due to some directorial choices, whereas Infinity War did a lot to cut fat and, perhaps due to its position being 2nd to last chronologically, had some actual impactful scenes.[換行字元][換行字元]For Endgame specifically, there was a ""thing"" about it that also felt very out of place in contrast to what the tone was (if you've seen the movie you'll know what I'm talking about).[換行字元][換行字元]But with these negative points in mind, there were some VERY gratifying scenes, both for those Marvel fans (which I didn't care too much about) and for those who understand what kind of expectations this film needed to meet. And because of these scenes and their execution, I didn't feel cheated out of an ending and I can understand why fans would cry.[換行字元][換行字元]Congratulations Marvel fans, it's very rare that a fanbase can see their media being remade to still meet their high demands, and I think Marvel has done it for you guys.[換行字元][換行字元]Just please keep discussion open though. Just because someone doesn't feel as strongly as you do does not mean they disrespect your opinion; some people enjoy asking the tough questions to get to a deeper truth."
2016,"Funny, moving, intelligent and edge of your seat action. A film to be watched, and then rewatched."
2017,"I first seen Iron Man when I was 6 years old. Now being 16 and seeing Endgame I am so happy I grew up with these movies. Endgame is an epic conclusion to an amazing story and I am excited for the future. It is action packed, full of emotion and funny at times too. Multiple scenes gave me goosebumps and brought tears to my eyes. I do not think I will see a better movie in my entire life."
2018,"This movie is absolute garbage. The hype for this movie was incredible, but the movie failed to live up to the hype. 20 mins fight sequence in a 3 hour film 😂. This movie is a waste of time and whoever watches this crap, please help them"
2019,I don't think was grt it was ok but won't watch again shame too
2020,Guys what are you doing lets make this movie a legend to our younger generations let them have the feel of our era's best movie! 10 on 10 guys do it for the sake of iron man!
2021,This movie was just plain amazing. I can't imagine it being any better. Easily 10/10.
2022,"Absolutely loved it, every character gets a good chunk of screen time and they all use it to full effect, its laugh out loud funny at times, really touching at times."
2023,Amazing avengers ... best so far[換行字元][換行字元]So funny and full of action and suspense ... loved it 100%
2024,"This movie for me deserves a second theater viewing for sure!! :D[換行字元][換行字元]11/10[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers, Assemble"
2025,It has distance to become like DC films and needs better dialogue
2026,"Happiness, sadness, excitement and action under one roof. Really I find this film far beyond the perfection. I would never be bored after seeing such amazing movie. Avengers ASSEMBLE."
2027,"I loved how the story of the Infinity War was conceived. With all the fight scenes and the emotional aspect of the movie, especially the end part, everything was superb. But this is supposed to be a wrap-up film. The directors and writers just destroyed it all. What's the point of doing a hype over Captain Marvel for this movie when you just give her a few minutes of screen time? It would be forgiven if you give her an amazing fight with the villain during the climax. But what have you done? With just a few kicks and punches and that's it. It doesn't give a scratch over Thano's face. What a crap!!![換行字元][換行字元]You also ruin Hulk! He is supposed to be the strongest Avenger after the events of Infinity War, after all the disappointment and frustration he has experienced when Hulk won't face Thanos. But this time, he's just as good as nothing Avenger. I wonder why they did not give Thanos and Hulk a fight of a lifetime. I'm really surprised that they did not even get face-to-face when all hell breaks loose.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie is dubbed as an action movie but got 75% of the time talking and mumbling.[換行字元][換行字元]There's no justice at all to those beloved characters and this movie. You have ruined my expectations."
2028,Amazing movie!! I love this ending. I was blown away
2029,"After watching Avengers Infinity War everyone who watched that film had a question ""what is going to happen next?' and this film answer our every single question. This is not just a film, this an experience that you will never forget."
2030,...great cast but lack of script.[換行字元][換行字元].........................
2031,"Very entertaining movie, but nothin too special in my opinion. Would still recommend it to everyone"
2032,"I went in the theater totally hyped, i couldn't stand still. I left the theater with a poker face and somewhat enraged. Don't get me wrong, it's the best Marvel film ever. It was just that it bombarded me with so many emotions that i didn't know what to feel on the end. Nobody was ready for this. And it was glorious."
2033,"To say the least, it brought so many story lines together and had brought the MCU to a rebirth of sorts. Saddening parts like the loss of Tony Stark and the end of Steve Roger's reign as Captain America. 10/10 . ( I would have given it a 12/10 but the scale doesn't go high enough). Amazing, well thought out and emotional movie."
2034,"I watch all films with an open mind and went into this 3 hour long film without any preconceptions.[換行字元][換行字元]This film really let itself down. The writers completely changed some of the characters, they tried to make it funny and failed at every attempt where it was cringe worthy and boring. The story was dragged out to its limit and went on for way to long.[換行字元][換行字元]Don't waste your money at the cinema, maybe Google the outcome."
2035,"I was in tears when it was all over, so many years and so much energy put into this saga and I just loved it all."
2036,"The most anticipated film of the year: Reviewing ""Avengers: Endgame"" (NO SPOILERS)[換行字元][換行字元]Saying this film gives fan service does not even begin to scratch the surface, as it is littered from beginning to end with quips. humor, forced appearances and minor characters. While being a send off to the old and an introduction to the new, this film was literally the end of the MCU as we know it, making me personally fear for the future of the franchise. It's not a bad film by any means, but it also fails to live up to the hype and emotion promised, although my screening was filled with thunderous applause, laughter, and literal sobbing at the end. Endgame is sort of a mess, and the story goes everywhere until finally reaching the climax. The film is split into three acts, all of which go entirely different directions, the first act is somber, yet humorous, for no reason at all. The second act is slightly confusing, but brilliant, bringing us back to different moments remembered throughout the MCU, and the third act is an all-out battle, not filmed particularly well. As far as films that wrap up a series go, with the 3-hour plus run-time, most of ""Endgame"" falls into the extremely average category, as more character growth should have been realized and the full potential of the original six Avengers, minus a couple, was never fully realized. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Jeremy Renner stand out in their respective roles, where Scarlett Johanson, Mark Ruffalo, and Chris Hemsworth feel greatly under utilized. The more modern Avengers cast is fresh, for the most part, but we begin to see where the MCU has over-saturated the franchise itself, as some characters that are even in briefly are far too invincible for a Universe based in modern times. The conclusion of the film will bring tears to some, but it's the closing the original MCU deserves after 11 long years. See it in the theater. ""Infinity War"" was the superior film. 7.5/10"
2037,"A nice fun movie for comic lovers and families to watch. Entertaining. This film is really good but not great. It is much better than Infinity War and miles over that nonsense we saw called Age of Ultron. In spite of how good this film is, this really did not need to be 3 hours long. Maybe 2 hours 20 minutes, most of the beginning scenes were out of place and even some of the ending scenes. The action scenes were good quality, one of the best I've scene in a movie. The acting wasn't great, but good. Although this movie's storyline isn't The Dark Knight/Rises, Shawshank Redemption, or Empire Strikes Back quality, I am confused as to why the rating is a 9. The storyline is pretty average. Again, fun movie to watch, but not a movie I would watch more than twice. I've grown up a comic fan and have loved super heroes before they were considered cool, but don't expect this movie to meet beyond your expectations. It is all hype. That said I give this movie an 8 at the most."
2038,"The Infinity Gauntlet trilogy was one of my most cherished comic books growing up. I would have never imagined it would become a movie one day. With each movie after the original Iron Man that truly started shaping the MCU, it was clear Marvel was taking the direction of adapting my beloved comic to the big screen. I was very apprehensive but they surpassed everything I could dream of. After some 30 MCU movies, they got the formula down to a science with the right amounts of action, funny, epic, touching and overall awesomeness to please most people and the result is a memorable experience that is a perfect conclusion of this generation of MCU. Bravo, and from that little kid who didn't have much besides comics growing up: thank you!"
2039,Funny. Lovely. Action. Epic and at the same time full of meaning. Everything is going perfect
2040,"While the film isn't perfect I couldn't help but pump my fist and squirm in my chair at every moment. It's so exhilarating and exciting. I do agree that the time travel in the film does not obey its own rules at all, it still supplies the viewer with tons of fan service that they will remember for years to come. I left the movie satisfied with what I saw, a perfect finale to many characters story's."
2041,"A perfect ending for our hero, the movie is still funny and sad sometimes, battle is epic and many scenes remind me of 10 years of marvel and comic. best movie ever"
2042,"I've never been this devastated in my whole life knowing that everything that i've love will finally come to an end but the end is worth-it! Mixed emotions ,i've been laughing and crying the entire film and I ran out of superlatives to describe this magnificent creation. THANK YOU MARVEL."
2043,"Honestly,the expectations were high. After Infinity War,and after Ant-man and the Wasp and Captain Marvel,the adrenaline was in the air. If there's one thing that Disney has done well, it's the media campaign.I wasn't expecting a movie with so much anxiety from the time of The Dark Knight.But let's get to the film now. First of all: three hours in duration.No problem. The three hours while watching pass without you even noticing. Second: plot.I don't want to spoil, but if I had to divide the film based on the success of the story, I'd say: 1)First thirty minutes: not very exciting. 2)From thirty minutes to two hours:excellent, indeed extraordinary. 3)Last hour: nothing memorable.Simple fan service,except for some twists done well. Third: action.So and so.As evidenced by the trailer,Thanos is faced by Captain America, Iron Man and Thor.Here,the confrontation that follows is the most memorable and exciting moment of the film;indeed, of the entire MCU.Really.The rest,some fistfights here and there. Final response: if you are new to the MCU, you will like it.If you are expecting a lot of hype like in Infinity War,expect one,big (as for me) or small,disappointment. Good vision to all."
2044,"Just for back with my wife and some Friends from the movie theater, and frankly i thought that this movie was pretty descent, however way too overrated.[換行字元][換行字元]It had a good concept, cool CGI, emocional ending and some funny parts.[換行字元][換行字元]But it also had a huge lack of charactet development, way too much time wasted on dialogs wich could've been used for more action and other characters that bearly appeared until the very ending, not too impresive fight coreographies, way too much expectations for too little impact.[換行字元][換行字元]Like i said, it's pretty good, but overrated, i personally liked Infinity War much better."
2045,"A great way to conclude the first 21 movies with this epic 3hr conclusion. The complexity of which this movie ties in/goes back to multiple other Marvel movies is unreal & makes sense. You will laugh, cheer & cry....."
2046,"Avengers Endgame was a good movie. I don't know what it could've done differently. It had action, comedy, drama, and big surprises. Everyone had a chance to get their story told on screen and be the main focus. I did feel though that sometimes the movie did drag on a little, but it was necessary to get the characters emotions across. For some reason I could not stand any scene with Captain Marvel. She just had this intense arrogance about her that rubbed me the wrong way, considering every other character was already fully developed by the time she arrives onto the scene. The story was great, it had the perfect blend of comedy, and drama that just kept things flowing. Although whenever it came to the drama, I did get a little bored. I love drama, but these moments just felt like they were taking forever. Also, I feel the battle scenes could've been more intense. They were too far and few in between. I enjoyed the ending, it brought closure whether you liked it or not. I feel with movies like these, movies that bring an end to something that has been built up over soo many years, is always going to give you a sense of dissatisfaction. I don't know if it's because of the sadness that it's all over, or maybe the story didn't play out how you wanted too. I don't know where that feeling comes from, but this gave that to me. I don't really have to say whether you should watch it or skip it because unless you're living under a rock, you've either watched it or are going to watch it. I gave this movie an 8/10. It was a good movie, but I felt Infinity Wars was better in terms of delivery, battle scenes and excitement. Check it out for yourself."
2047,"No words can describe this masterpiece movie. you will enjoy every single minute in this movie. You will enjoy and cry in the same time, at the end you will be satisfied."
2048,"This marvel movie is a little different than other Marvel Movies, BUT! Its better and its so good! Its Worth your Money and time. ITS SO GOOD JUST WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (My opinion)"
2049,"An epic finish of The Infinity Saga. Great movie, great story, emotional movie etc. Congratulations to all Cast & Crew you guys did a great job and specially to Robet Downey Jr. Mr Kevin Fiege and The Russo Brothers you guys are the best!"
2050,Honestly just great. This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. Words can't describe. A must watch
2051,"This is without a doubt the very best movie I have ever seen in my entire life and the most unexpected,most emotional movie,the events,the characters,......wow"
2052,"Violence is main means of conflict resolution, but story is primarily about courage, self-sacrifice, heroism, collective good. Themes include teamwork, perseverance, courage. Central characters are willing to die (and kill) to save universe and rescue Earth from grief/trauma they've experienced. Also shows how important family and friendship are, how concept of family is more than pure biology: People can have incredibly strong chosen families, with friends who love you unconditionally. Emphasizes idea of being who you are, not who you think you're ""supposed"" to be."
2053,Couldn't have been a better way to end such a perfect saga.
2054,"A beautiful ending to a legendary story. No spoilers from me, a must watch. 100,000,000/10"
2055,The rating says it all. A well deserved 10/10. The movie was beautifully made with some of the best acting of the year. Oscars should have endgame competing for all the major awards.
2056,"After what happened in Infinity war, the only question I had was ""how can they top that?"" That question was answered, no other superhero movie will be able to beat Endgame. The movie just gets better and better and the huge finale is done spectacularly and has everything you want to see and much, much more. The set up for this was perfect, the build up to this was perfect, and the pay off was perfect. Avengers: Endgame is done flawlessly and perfectly."
2057,"Endgame wraps up the entire MCU in a nice little bow and allows you a decision: stop watching Marvel products and feel a sense of closure, or keep watching and use Endgame as a springboard for what's to come. Either way, this is an incredibly satisfying movie. The only reason I couldn't give it 10/10 is because this also, sadly, reinforced how much I hate Captain Marvel and Brie Larson; her five or six minutes of screen time were the only minutes that I didn't thoroughly enjoy."
2058,"Masterpiece! An amazing movie of the year. You can laugh, smile, angry, even cry in just one movie. Climax performance by Cap and Tony made me cry a lot. Maybe for some people who doesn't understand the story would be say it's boring, but if you understand and focus to the movie, you'll get the soul of this movie. I Love You 3000."
2059,"A bit like a compilation album, some really great tracks but generally just filler. Cinematically it was epic, spectacular, CGI filled superhero awesomeness but the film was slow to start (after a brilliant emotional first 15 mins) and I was mostly underwhelmed by the plot. I felt Thor was ruined by the joke and some parts were just cameos for the sake of it. I did sob with my son at the saddest part, but I still feel a bit... meh.... maybe I need to watch it again to see if it's better second time around!"
2060,I'LL MISS YOU AVENGERS... A big fan Of ironman 💔💔💔 great screen play.. A logical story with A lot of drama.. A Long movie And Very Funny though
2061,Best movie that I've ever sawn in my whole entire life this is definitely a box office hit
2062,"Avengers: Endgame is a movie full of stunning visuals, smart and witty dialogue, incredible acting and above all this movie has heart. I laughed, I cheered like a lunatic, I cried like a baby. This is an epic conclusion to an 11-year journey. The Russos really know what they are doing in the superhero genre and I can't wait to see what's next for them. Go see this movie. 10/10"
2063,This film was an emotionally resonant and wholly satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga. It goes to show how much it pays off when a visionary takes his time carefully crafting a Cinematic Universe. 11 years culimated into this awe-inspiring spectacle.
2064,Endgame brings all the previous marvel movies together to make a satisfying adventure that will have you wanting more. I was walking into the theatre expecting something amazing but i was blown away this movie is a must see and one i would watch again. So many parts of this film shocked me in happy and sad way! But marvel never forget to add some good old humour that made me laugh out loud a couple of times. The acting as always was really good this film is so well paced not rushed especially when you need to put so many characters and storylines in to a 3h movie the Russo brothers did it again!!
2065,What A Combo Of Action+Emotion+Comedy Marvel You Nailed It Loved This Movie 😍😍😍😍
2066,In marvel they can kill entire world with fingersnipping but in reality entire world don't know marvel. Film is too long to cover all stories background which needs knowledge of all films. But I don't know why sudden feminism. Marvel newbies find it very odd and boring and even end fight is not as great as promised and praised by few. Maybe marvel iron fans will love this but this film is not for all. It is meant and made for marvel fans and for their appreciation in which endgame succeeds
2067,It's got nothing do with whether you are MCU fan or a DC fan.The movie itself has made a benchmark.Hatsoff to the Russo brothers and the entire team of Avengers.Assemble Avengers Cheers 👍
2068,"No spoilers here , I won't write anything , I just wanted to share that this movie is one of the best movies of a lifetime that you can watch now. Go watch it !!!"
2069,"I loved it so much and I think I'm gonna watch it over a lot in the future! Great job at marvel, once again! Still processing all the things that happened in 3 hours of runtime. I normally don't cry, but this time I did sometimes blink a tear away. I had also lot's of moments where I laughed very hard (hopefully not too hard for the ppl around me :p). It was awesome, epic, well written, funny, heartbreaking, beautiful, exciting and much, much more... Go watch it, you'll enjoy it too!"
2070,That was a brilliant end of one of the best journey
2071,"You made a masterpiece, joyful, full of emotions and perfect moments. Finally, Robert Downey jr.,you are my favourite actor. God, I still can't believe that end."
2072,Best movie ever. Nonstop since the first second. I just watched it 2 hours ago and I'm still shaken and wired up about it. Definitely going to watch it again.
2073,Beautiful storyline and ending! Amazing job from everybody in the cast.
2074,I just going to experience best 3 hours in my life
2075,"If the film is viewed as a separate film then it is excellent in every respect, but since that is not the case then the film is mildly said to be a failed case. First I missed it with infinity war. A lot of mistakes that were not allowed to happen. Hulk, who during the whole series of avengers is unbeatable and who is beaten more and more becomes stronger and stronger, he is the greatest weakman, and also the vision that at that moment was the most powerful member of their family. I can understand that Tanos was extremely dominant about the stones, but the fact that the person who wrote the script was a lot of work, and then they made so many illogicalities that do not happen in children's films, for such a film is extremely bad. Then hopes fell on the end game. Hoping that at least a portion of these errors will be corrected and made a much better film that follows all the previous happenings in the entire series of Avenger, Iron Men, Torah ... did not happen. The opposite happened. They made many more errors than they could ever make. I'll only include a couple of extreme errors. The first who watched the Guardians of the Galaxy meant that then it was said that no mortal can hold infinity stones, let alone use it, and here they played with them as with clicks. Suddenly, the captain of America becomes the god of lightning, is it realistic that you did it, and after all, I do not know why Tanos needed stones at all when he threw them out of stone as a toy, if we already found out that the hula was beaten because he had a stone at that time power, what did he have now? Again I emphasize the film about the special effects and from the technical side fantastic and that it is completely separate from me would get a grade 10. This way, on my part, it can only get a score of 1."
2076,This is the wrap up for all the MCU Movies. Epic Ending. Must watch before you die.
2077,This is a superhero movie. It doesn't deserve a 9.3 rating. Better than Godfather? Shawshank? Are you kidding me?[換行字元][換行字元]It belongs at 7-8. Rated 6 to adjust for voter stupidity.
2078,"The storytelling is obviously inspired by unserious ""fun"" episodes or specials for TV, with its lack of real drama or any kind of directorial sophistication, just simple problem solving and casual action. Based on that, I can understand why people give this movie such a crazy-good rating. Its production values are truly monumental, or rather, the computing power is truly impressive, and the studio did good work.[換行字元][換行字元]But being what it is, I still can't rate it higher than average."
2079,"I can never be bothered with reviews but this films rating is beyond a joke. Plot is awkward and ridiculous... even for Marvel. Acting is non existent. Direction and editing just feels amateurish. I couldnt deal with anymore after the 1st hour it was excruciating. It feels like they gave a class of children the old ""how would you end the avengers"" lesson and just put all the answers in a bag and picked one.... and then just made it work.... or so they thought. I may feels the urge to watch the 1st half again and hope it inspires me to watch the conclusion but its highly doubtful."
2080,"This movie was a complete mess, after all the years of build up, I didn't care. It was like putting an entire smörgåsbord into a very small bowl. All the flavours and textures blended and lost their appeal. Only two characters stood out, Thor and Antman."
2081,"Avengers End Game is a thorough enjoyment through out the entire three hours. Not even a single moment I felt bored and full of humour and as well as emotional. Probably this may be the best of all the avengers series.[換行字元][換行字元]Coming to characters, I always like Doctor strange. So, at first I was kind of worried because doctor strange had to sacrifice in the Avengers Infinity War. But then I also like Ant Man which convinced me that I would enjoy. Of course there is more heroic characters like Iron Man, Captain America and etc but I most liked the Ant Man and Doctor strange and I need to say that I am not disappointed at all not even for one percent. For others also, it will definitely be satisfying as the movie holds greater screenplay and perfect dialogues and more of that amazing 3D and background score which makes Avengers End Game makes the perfect movie."
2082,"Avengers Endgame couldn't be estimated without all previous cinematography of marvel universe. It's a logical ending and consolidated result of all it work. During the film you could see improving changes of clothing, stuff and visual graphic which have been made from previous films. Everywhere the film is repoted to be overestimated. But in my opinion the plot of this is pretty goodish. Despite some needless scenes and scenes with low-level humour, all performance is fascinatingly to watch."
2083,"To sit there in the cinema and laugh your heart out one second, then the other scream of excitement and the third cry of sadness is not easy for one movie to pull off! THIS is the best Marvel movie so far and the best end that it could ever be! Marvel fan or not. You want to see this one. If it's just for the special effects, the costumes or just the raw jokes you are going to enjoy it!"
2084,"I cant say anything that hasent all ready been said just watch it then buy, this is a movie to own for sure"
2085,"I want to get this out that I don't think marvel is overrated. Although I'm not a huge fan of the whole universe, I can understand why many are. I really like a great deal of the movies, my favourites is probably guardians 1 and 2 I'm very happy that this is a financial success, it's always fun to see marvel out do themselves at the box office, and this film is nearly the highest grossing movie of all time. Critically however I find this movie overrated, Unlike infinity war this film meanders a lot. Many of the jokes don't land and some of the scenes are down right stupid. I though the last action scene was great and the dialogue like usual is fun If you think this is the best movie ever I don't want to change your opinion, personally I cannot understand this being 0.5 ratings below the Godfather"
2086,"The movie is good, but me and my teenage daughter and her friends saw it tonight and all were a bit disappointed. We all feel Infinity War was much better and I personally felt the first hour dragged out too slow and long. Don't get all the 10/10 scores."
2087,It is the best movie I ever seen.this types of movies came once in a decked.the actor and actresses are give there best. I ONLY just wanted to say see this movie
2088,I went in feeling I was not ready for the ending. I laughed a lot and cried a couple of times.[換行字元][換行字元]Some characters story are beginning some are ending. But For me I feel that they were respectfull to everybody and I can honestly say that I am at peace with this ending. Ill deffo go again this saturday.[換行字元][換行字元]A well deserved 10 for the end of a decade of filmmaking!!
2089,"Mild spoilers ahead: This movie could lose some 60 minutes and nobody would notice (or probably will - it would be more fun). Some great acting wasted. Exponential comic absurdity mixed with cheap philosophy. SFX could be much better for such an epic attempt. Weepy ending with forced pathos ruins everything. I was truly glad when it finally was over. 3 stars for wrapping this up, hopefully for good."
2090,I am speechless.... This movie is so cool and yet I am sad that this marks the end of the Avengers.
2091,"Beautiful everything, watch it. Its speak better for it selves than any critic can ever do"
2092,"If you didn't saw that movie, do it. If you didn't saw any marvel movies, watch all avengers films, or (if you have time ofc) watch all marvel films, even if they not so good as this one. The amount of epic in this film can be compared to all LOTR and Hobbit films combined. Just watch it. Just do it."
2093,"No disappointment at all with this movie, the build up with all of the they marvel movies and then to end with this it was just amazing"
2094,Amazing finish to the marvel cinematic trilogy. The movie had lots of great comedy and action interwoven and of course Thanos makes it ev
2095,"This movie is in its core a fan service. It has everything you want , expect and then some. It makes you understand the characters much better, and hell of an ending. If you are an MCU fan watch it, a comics fan watch it. There were tons of references to comics as well and they were great."
2096,"Had high expectations for this movie, but is was the worst =("
2097,"It really what we can call, the best end to the avengers. The visual effects are wonderful with lots of laughter and emotional scenes. The 3d 4dx worth it."
2098,What a boring long movie. OK special effects are great. But the story line is boring. Nothing happens in first 90 minutes. The rest of the movie is a lot of fuss about some stones. Boooooooooring! I was happy the long sit was over. I read the reviews here and I honestly do not understand why people are so enthusiastic about this movie.
2099,"... it somehow leaves you (or in that case just me) with a kind of an empty, shallow feeling. That said it is very entertaining, all the bits and pieces you'd expect are there and the scale surely is epic. It certainly doesn't feel like a 3 hour flick so that does say something. But for me I think it is time to move on, but I definitely will watch Guardians 3 now that James Gunn is back on board ;)"
2100,"This movie make me laugh until cry. Just enjoy every scene in this movie, and accept the ending sincerely.[換行字元][換行字元]I hope Marvell with Disney will make more Universe like MCU."
2101,"I won't really say much because i want everyone to go in fresh like I did.end game left me speechless the movie is perfect you will absolutely not be disappointed... I've given a 10 out of 10 rating to 7 movies and 1 tv show, for Godfather 2/The Shining/Berry Gordys The Last Dragon/The Wizard of Oz/March of the Wooden Soldiers/Avengers/Wild style and my tv show Seinfeld well guess what add END GAME to that list baby!!...i will say this get your f%CK!% popcorn ready for this $#!+ here!!!"
2102,Wish it was longer. But 10/10......[換行字元][換行字元]. . . . . . . .
2103,"This movie is a love letter to the MCU and it's fans, beautiful in every way, i cried, laugh, cheered, smiled, i was surprised, amazed, sad, happy, exited, and i can go on and on but you get the point, an incredible ending to my favorite saga ever."
2104,Stop reading the reviews & go watch it in theaters..... Its worth it
2105,It was the most fantastic movie I've seen in recent years.There is no other film that tells the Marvel heroes so well.
2106,First half of the movie is bit slow for marvel movie but it was made that way to bring story together.[換行字元][換行字元]Second half of the movie was excellent. Had to agree that Russo brother are really good in providing a good closure to this franchise.
2107,"This movie is amazing! Everything it has been said to be and more, highly recommend!"
2108,"Let me ask you a question. When your kid was born...were you nervous?[換行字元]Wildly. Yeah.[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]-Did you feel qualified? Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing? -I literally pieced it together as I went along,I thought about what my Dad did, and...[換行字元][換行字元]-My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt. -I thought my Dad was tough on me.And now, looking back, I just remember the good stuff, you know.

That kid's not even here yet and, there's nothing I wouldn't do for him."
2109,"An all you can eat experience, but as most ""all you can eat"" restaurants the food quality is not the best. Shallow plot with many loopholes. Total waste of time."
2110,"What a film! Avengers: Endgame did not disappoint. The Russo brothers have managed to perfectly balance drama, character, humour, breathtaking action and big stakes amongst a cast bigger than a high school yearbook! Though there a couple of questions and potential plot holes that remain once the credits roll, you almost don't mind as the journey was worth it. For any comic book fan this was exactly what marvel comics do translated to the big screen. You get the grand battle featuring the entire ensemble all at once, with everything on the line. Exactly translated as you'd see in the pages of Marvel comics. A perfect ending to an amazing saga."
2111,"I read the user reviews before I saw this movie. I thought perhaps the negative reviews were a bit unfair. But no! The cinema was filled to the max- I have never seen this before! Today's paper reported it is the highest grossing movie in history! Why? The audience were enraptured, laughing at seemingly unfunny moments, and cheering when good guy characters emerged. I think everyone drank the kool aid! Most of the movie is ordinary and just like other Avenger movies. Special effects were used to insert characters in cameo roles. Nothing new here folks! I have tried to analyze its popularity and have concluded that it is really simple to please the masses. People dont want complex scifi, a simple good- bad guy formula with a touch of routine comedy, good looking actors made more attractive with special effects touch ups, and some character familiarity will do the trick. Throw in a lot of multicultural references and political correctness and voila! Big bucks."
2112,"This has to easily be my favourite MCU movie and I am so damn impressed with how they managed to pull it off that you care about everyone in it at all of the time. This film never stops and I even cared about and was into the action, which I rarely did before.[換行字元][換行字元]I will rewatch this for sure, which I often don't want to do with most of Marvel, and absolutely don't know what to even say anymore. I love it, and as someone who likes superhero movies but often doesn't love them, that just blows me away.[換行字元][換行字元]It is so well put together, and just wow. I mean wow. I mean I fell asleep while watching a bunch of these flicks, surely not with this one. Three hours. And they made it work. That's so insane."
2113,"I did enjoy the first half of the show. It was subtle and emotional. This was the first time ever in the franchise that they show us the capability of the actors they hired (except for Chris Hemsworth and Tom Holland of course as they have been pretty much one-note. Well, it might be because of the script. They can still prove their ability in many other movies in the future).[換行字元][換行字元]Then the action part came in. The central theme of the Avengers franchise. The time traveling was intriguing and everything, but seriously the end was a mess. That scene with force-feminism was ""cringy"" to its best. The death of the character(s) also felt forced and unnecessary."
2114,Great movie! The emotions are all in I cried and got goosebumps They did great👍🏻👍🏻
2115,"I'd prefered seen dumbo ! I loved infinity war, but this one is so disapointing ! It's just à other movies of 33% Ironman, 32% captain america, 31% thor. And 4% for the rest of the bande without a good scenario or strory. Characters are not treated properly I feel used / stole my money. Captain Marvel is not in the movies at all. Even Thanos is so badly explain..."
2116,"Absolutely perfect conclusion of 10 years of MCU and the excellent ending of Avenger. Don't read reviews, not even spoiler free one. Go see it you won't Regret it! 10 on 10!"
2117,"Good Movie and it har its moments but.. it just felt like this movie was out of place in MCU.. I dont know.. was hoping for more, specially when this is the last movie of the era..."
2118,"This movie made me feel so many emotions and was simply brilliantly written. I can not describe how excruciating the year and a day long wait was, but it was so incredibly worth it. Bring tissues."
2119,"In today's age of XXLsize TV screens, fancy home theatre systems and outstanding content available at the click of a button, the primay reason for watching a flick in a movie theatre is the community watching experience and nothing could surpass the experience of watching Avengers: Endgame! It was nearly akin to watching your favourite sport in a stadium with the audience vocally rooting for the home team! A must watch, even if one is not tuned into MCU![換行字元][換行字元]PS: Dont wait up for the post credit scene - there isn't one!"
2120,"This was a terrible movie, no one and convince me otherwise. Over hyped and with a poor storyline. There were some good moments and scenes, sure. But overall? No. Just no."
2121,Don't believe the reviews. I suspect it's people paid to do positive reviews. Either that or I saw a different movie! Nothing much happens for 2 hours. There was no plot to speak of and i could have written better dialogue! The soundtrack is the best thing about it seriously
2122,"There are numerous plot holes, and honestly, it has been overhyped. Is it worth the watch? Yes, once. But the childish humor and ridiculous plot do not make this a 10/10 or anywhere close."
2123,"If I could give more than 10 stars, I would. Right out of the gate I was absolutely floored, I had very high expectations for this movie and it still surpassed them by a huge margin. I was not prepared, you can't predict or imagine how incredible this movie is. Calling it a movie doesn't even do it justice. This is an EXPERIENCE. It blows every other MCU movie out of the water, while still honouring the legacy. Thank you Russo Brothers, no one could've done anything like this. Words can't describe how fantastic, epic, insane, cathartic, shocking this is. A true GIFT to the fans. Seeing it opening night in a jam packed theatre full of fans was wonderful. We laughed, cheered, and cried together. So many moments absolutely blew my mind and currently thinking about them again is giving me shivers and making my heart leap. THIS MOVIE IS FUNNIER THAN YOU EXPECT. I laughed so much! It didn't feel forced either, the humour flowed really well with the emotion. I cried tears of joy way more than I expected, and tears of sadness. But this movie was the most satisfying possible ending, I left happy. I did not think I'd leave happy. I have literally just one complaint and it's so small I can forget it. I'll need to see this a bunch more times to soak it all in. My heart is full, and I will cherish this first viewing of many, forever."
2124,Goooood moves and amazing thanks for thas good luck
2125,"We have seen it far too many times now.. 90% greenscreen fighting against bad guys and the good guys end up winning. Just More of the same old recipe, other than that it was executed as good as all of the other superheromovies. For me, im done.. Its Just the same, if you like it to be the same then its probably 8/10 for you"
2126,"Got me feeling so many things, perfect end to an amazing era. Feel blessed to have been on this from the start, on the premiere. Best way to spend three hours on a screen!"
2127,"Just saw the film. Beautiful. Funny. Sad. Awesome. My friend and I can gladly say this film summates the vigorous journey that we have all been on since the first Iron man in 2008. The Russo's have wonderfully done it again, with this film out-shining many of their previous films, and many of the other marvel films. This film has the ability to manage a complicated storyline having eleven years and twenty-two films lying on its shoulders, and yet still is able to incorporates stunning visuals, brilliant acting, great dialogue, beautiful cinematography, score, and more. The film is hands-down, the best film marvel has created. It beautifully captures the true heart, love, and pain that these films have always produced for the fans. It is amazing. I myself, will be remembering this one for years.[換行字元][換行字元]Enjoy it, you earned it. The long await has finally come.[換行字元][換行字元]P.S. I feel like this film is honestly Oscar worthy. Robert Downey Jr's performance is amazing, where he beautifully captures this extensive journey of material in film, which all started with him. His time and effort, which has created this cultural phenomenon deserves praise. Also, the Russo brothers. These comedically genius brothers have positively made their mark in cinema, through this film. If they do not receive a nomination for either best director, or the film isn't nominated for best picture, I don't know what the academy is doing. I know they don't normally go for comic book movies, but this, this is something different.[換行字元][換行字元]Have fun people."
2128,"End game and infinity war were a bit ott. The phrase jumping the shark did spring to mind, which is always a danger when invoking magic and time travel in movies to resolve the unsolvable. I say this as someone who is a fan of Dr Strange (and Constantine if I can mention them together).[換行字元][換行字元]I think the humour worked better than the sentimental segments and overall I'm glad I watched them.[換行字元][換行字元]As a lifelong fan of Marvel, which means comics before movies, I always felt that live action movies never captured the essence of the comic book. Animations are much closer (and the DC animations are suburb)."
2129,Great movie got everything movie needs and it very entertaining.
2130,Its a great present story which uses the past 11 years of the whole series in order to give it the best ending possible. You are not expecting a movie this good!
2131,"I watched the movie multiple times, and will probably watch it multiple times more. It was fantastic and if you enjoy the genre even a little bit, you will absolutely love this movie. Watching the previous Avenger movies is kind-of required. Just steer clear of that utterly forgettable Captain Marvel movie."
2132,Absolutely spectacular. Constantly engaged and is the most satisfying film an MCU fan will watch.
2133,"Yes, this movie is good. But does it deserve the insane praise it's been getting? In my opinion no. My screening ended with a round of applause as if we just watched the best film ever made with the words ""insane"" and ""incredible"" thrown round. This movie is neither, it is certainly not ""insane"" as I found this movie to be very predictable at times, not all the time, but in scenes that are supposed to be very emotional and shocking didn't surprise me at all. At times this film was also pretty messy as so much was going on so I would forget what was happening when a scene was being revisited. Not all negatives though, I only wanted to mention negatives because everyone seems to think this film is incredible. The comedy in this film was very well done, I found myself laughing many times but I found it to be a bit weird because the premise is that half the universe has been killed and they were making jokes left, right and centre after 20mins. Personally I feel this movie is one of the most overrated ever. I fear that many have forgotten what a truly great film is, this may seem snobby but this movie is just entertaining and far from perfectly made."
2134,"The most awaited movie from MCU would definitely blow your mind. The story starts off a bit slow just to give you the character referencing and build plot to the grand finale of this epic battle. It has too many jaw dropping moments, some cleverly written jokes and a superb climax. I would strictly recommend not to miss this movie."
2135,The movie has a slow two hour start. The time travel thing was a bad idea. The end was good and saves the movie from receiving a six rating.
2136,"This is my first and will probably be my only review on IMDB. I have just come out watching Endgame and in the 3 hours run time have gone through every emotion possible. This is how you make a film, wow, just wow. The action scenes out of this world, the emotion tears you apart, the comedy was excellent and by the story and how they wrap it up is triply amazing. I can not rate this film enough ... as they say haters hate but if you appreciate you will not be dissapointed. Thank you Marvel !"
2137,Just how much time we need to see a movie like this again
2138,"This movie is incredible. When i wasnt in shock, i had the grin the whole time. It really reward the fans who followed the MCU since IronMan 1. I laughed, I cried, and it trully was tour de force. I dont thing i will see anything like that in my lifetime. Bravo"
2139,Truly epic and incredible experience worth every penny
2140,"Emotional, exhausting, funny heartbreaking. From beginning to end it takes you through all the emotions and ends 11 years of films brilliantly. Never had a film that gives me chills at so many different points. So worth the wait and definitely lives up to the hype. Visually stunning"
2141,"More than 3h of ""yes sure..."" BS. The franchise is at its end and CGI won't rescue it."
2142,"This film is hard to talk about without spoiling it, it is a 3 hour movie and the furthest I'll go in terms of talking about what is in the movie, is to say that we have seen nothing of it from the trailers. The movie is very heartfelt, and that's performed by the excellent character development. Throughout the years of the MCU, you feel like you know these characters, but not that personally, and this film definitely fills the missing gap there. We actually get to see these characters not fighting, doing things many of us wouldn't imagine and it makes these guys we have seen on the big screen for the past 11 years so much more lovable. This movie is also truly ror the fans, coming into this movie with not much knowledge about Marvel wouldn't make you feel the same way of the movie that a fan would in terms of understanding and emotions. Avengers: Endgame is pieced together masterfully, by the Russo Brothers, who I must acknowledge for directing a movie like this. They did an excellent job with pacing, plot and keeping the whole 3 hours completely discrete and unpredictable. This movie very much feels like a culmination of what the past 11 years, and 22 movies in the MCU have lead up to. The final act is absolutely astounding, and really shows you what the MCU has come to, being one of my favourite scenes from not only all of the MCU but also that I've ever seen. Make sure not to miss a single minute of this movie, with all of it being important. This movie was so close to being perfect, making the right choices, bringing an emotional tone we've never had before and so much more that worked, but there were a few tiny problems. Firstly, CGI seems a little bit off in some or the scenes, which is a bit disappointing but minor enough to the point that no casual watcher would notice. Second, some of their jokes just don't land, especially in one scene at the very end. Third, it feels like it could be a bit shorter, with some scenes in the second half that didn't really matter. Overall, this movie is astounding, but only for Marvel fans. The 3 hours doesn't feel that long whatsoever, maybe feeling a bit long towards the end, but the movie keeps to be very entertaining all the way throughout. Avengers: Endgame is the best representation of Marvel as a whole, and is easily the best MCU movie yet, with Captain America: Civil War right below it. There are many theories online, and I'm aware of most of them, I can confirm that nearly all of them aren't even close or barely play a part in the movie. It definetely will hold up as the best movie of 2019, and I can't wait to see what's in store for the MCU. Keep in mind, there's no after credits, it doesn't matter how long you stay. Besides, the very final scene itself feels like an after credits scene."
2143,"Plot holes everywhere, cheesy lines,basically the average superhero movie and no one sees how bad it is because they're blinded by hype, endgame was a mediocre poorly thought out rushed movie that feels more like a cashgrab"
2144,"It's been said, that there will never be another phenomenon like Star Wars. With this film however, the Marvel Cinematic Universe saga is the only one that came at least a bit close. The closure of a 10 year old journey is simply beautiful, epic and surprisingly emotional. Marvel Studios brought a unique and already iconic ending, that will define blockbuster cinema for decades to come. The Russo Brothers have shown yet again that they are not just incredible storytellers, but that they have a huge respect and love for each character in this series. I have never shaked and cried so much during a Marvel movie before. An event in cinematography's history that I am going to cherish for the rest of my life. 9/10"
2145,Do watch all the marvel movies before watching this one..
2146,"This is the best Marvel Movie ever, make you cray, make you laugh, sad, angry, excited and then satisfied."
2147,"No superhero movie can ever reach the scale, this movie was able to do."
2148,Was everything I expected and more! Awesome movie.
2149,"Started slow at first but I could see why...setting all the characters in the past up and tying things altogether- brilliant fight scene at the end. I did not expect all the marvel troops to come out of nowhere like that; it really did give me goosebumps. A bit of everything sad, happy, great action and story.....well done!"
2150,Had huge expectations from End Game after the ending of Infinity War and it just fell flat after initial 40 min's.[換行字元][換行字元]Movie feels boring at lot of places and the ending....lets not talk about it... could have been more sensational. There are few moments having humour...but those moments are very shortlived. What worst...made martyr of character whose movies were the best of all Marvel Universe.
2151,This is until now my best experience in cinema.[換行字元][換行字元]When see the movie you will know how its connected with all the previous movies of Avengers.[換行字元][換行字元]I recommend to see Avengers Infinity War then Avengers Endgame immediately.
2152,"Well, Avengers: Endgame... you know your watching something special when throughout the film the audience is cheering, laughing, crying and clapping! Endgame is an emotional roller coaster that bids a perfect farewell to the heroes we have grown to love over the past 11 years. Avengers, Disassemble..."
2153,"So by this point you all know what this movie is and what it's about. I'm just going to give you the good and the bad:[換行字元][換行字元]The Bad: Some of Captain America's decisions at the end seems slightly out of character. Since it's the last movie, I kind of wish we spent more time with the ""Classic"" versions of these characters. It does assume that you have seen all of the other movies.[換行字元][換行字元]Good: Pretty much every thing else. Strong finale. Possibly one of the best versions of superhero fight scene ever put on film. Nebula's full good guy turn surprisingly works (it helps that film Nebula is much more likable than comic Nebula). It gives the Lord of the Ring finale a run for it's money while giving all the characters even those who are there for brief cameos a chance to shine."
2154,Just. Wow. What. A. Movie. Loved. Every. Bit. Of. It.
2155,"Speechless. Whatever you were hoping to expect, you got more. Incredible acting gave this film a gratifying flow, everything was smooth. There was humour, very funny indeed and not at all cringeworthy. And mostly, which is practically in every review, is that it was very emotional. For someone who has never, and I say never, cried in a cinema, having watched some all time great films like Schindler's List and The Shawshank Redemption, this film brought a tear to my eye, no only because of all the drama that was being built up during the film, but understanding that this was a quintessential conclusion to an unforgettable 11 years of the MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]Every character got their part, it was perfectly balanced. I can't emphasise how good the visual effects are, they draw you into the film. The visual effects were supported by outstanding acting, and I've got to give it to RDJ and Evans, the remarkable talent they have can sometimes go completely unnoticed. As per usual, the others were spectacular.[換行字元][換行字元]This is what you call a superhero film. This is what you call the perfect conclusion, the best one to any film.[換行字元][換行字元]IF THERE IS ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS FILM, IT IS IT'S DURATION. IT SHOULD BE 6 HOURS!"
2156,"It wasn't bad, bu it's a simple action cliche, with humor, without drama or deep message. What special about infinity war, is the conflict. The villain is not all evil. He wants to create a better world for everyone to thrive. Infinity war ends with a dissonance, and many viewers, me included asked themselves - maybe he is right. Endgame starts with a simple answer - the world is a mess after Thanos actions. I think the world can thrive even with half of the population, but here right from the beginning the answer is simple. Endgame switched from the attempt to make the bad guy have deep character, into a clear message: ""Thanos is all bad"". Well this message continues through the entire movie, and I hate the fact they ruined the deep complex villain character, with a ""want to destroy all, including his comrades "" boring villain."
2157,"The last Scene is incredible, a very good end of amazing story"
2158,"I think this movie was great from beginning to end. You got both side of the characters personal lives, from hitting rock bottom, to becoming worthy. It was an awesome range of actual life. The championship, on top of the world feeling, all the way to rock bottom, alcoholism, despair, depression, defeat, worthlessness, and loneliness. It made the characters more human. You usually only see heroes in triumph, this showed what it is like to experience defeat, and the bounce back in a more emotional and dark way than we are not used to. Tony someday it up perfectly in his line, ""we are the avengers, were are not supposed to be the re-avengers"", Paraphrasing obviously."
2159,"After watching Avengers Endgame , I am ready to say, with all my heart, that this movie is the most unique, fun, touching and satisfying movie ever... Oh and it's not only the best superhero movie ever, it's the best movie in history 🙌 --- ASSEMBLE!"
2160,"Its a gem and full of emotions. you burst into tears, you laugh like you have laughed never before. Its a 3 hours long movie and you can not take eyes off the screen for a single moment."

2162,"Of course it couldnt be as good as Infinity War. And to be fair it could be terrible, wich it isnt. But it is still not great in any way. 1 good joke and just a bunch of revisiting past episodes, thats it. Thats End Game. They sure leaned on tear jerking hard, and it did get me a little with Nebula reaching out. but overall it just shows that going into time travel paradoxes can be funny or stupid. And here it is second one i am afraid. Not a waste of time, but far from Infinity war. They would get so ,much respect if they actually ended it with IW))"
2163,"This movie is everything i wanted it to be. The third act is insane and emotional. The other two acts are great too. All the acting is good, the directing is great, the special effects are great, everything is good. The only things i didn't really like much is how there was a little too much humor. I also didn't like how they portrayed hulk in it, i couldn't really take it seriously. But the positives outweigh the negatives. The only MCU movies that i think are better are Infinity War and Civil War."
2164,"Without doubt one of the best films I've ever seen. I was completely gripped from the beginning. Fantastic performances by all of the cast (not that we'd expect any less), I find it hard to pick a favourite character because they're all so awesome, in this film more so than ever. I was on the edge of my seat throughout all of the action sequences, and have known few films to evoke such intense feelings of hope, and also great sadness/ loss. The humour throughout the film is spot on, and in one of the most important final scenes you could have heard a pin drop in the cinema, it was like everybody was holding their breath - staring at the screen in complete disbelief. As far as I can tell, no one saw that coming which is a credit to the writers and directors who were able to piece everything together so cleverly. It's an absolute masterpiece. Just one warning, though - if you're anything like me you'll need to go armed with tissues."
2165,"10/10? What film were you watching? 1/10? C'mon, we've all seen a lot worse. It wasn't as much as I hoped for, but I didn't leave the theater pissed off either. Ergo... a meh 5/10"
2166,One word review masterpiece. Can't explain or give further . Its beyond reviewing. Speechless. A must watch .
2167,Kids wrote plot for the movie. Ppl are getting made for nothing
2168,"Seen it last night & I definitely enjoyed EVERY bit of this film Stan Lee would be so proud of this film & everyone that was a part of this!! This was worth waiting for EVERYONE did such an EXCELLENT JOB making this film not only that it was also worth watching for 3 hours if anyone is really into any marvel film! I would LOVE to see it again and again! I can't wait for those that's been waiting for this day to come finally see it! I've NEVER wrote a long review like this before lol! Shoutout to EVERYONE in this movie, The Russo Brothers and lastly Stan Lee( R.I.P.) again I know he'll be so proud!"
2169,"This is simply the greatest super-heroe movie that I watched, have everything that a geek needed, its a huge tribute about everything that MCU represents, its shocking how they got all the events get work in 3 hours (and I have to say that don't look soo long), it's very emotional, beauty photography, and amazing visual effects! The plot it's impeccable, the action it's incredible, it's a big war and I just screamed out loud and vibrated with many moments that I just didn't wait, in fact you can perceive that it is the end, and I cry very bad, and still i'm crying remembering every things. This is it, Marvel got it again."
2170,I Have Watched Every Single Movie & Every Single TV Show... This Is Awful.[換行字元][換行字元]They Hyped This Up So Much Yet Was So
2171,"Good movie. A good ending to a great saga Loved the acting and direction was superb but the length of the movie was tediously long. the movie fails to keep the tempo. The character arch of some were strangely distorted. overall a great movie. loved the ending. Tony Stark, Captain America, thor, Hulk, Black widow and Hawkeye will always remain in our hearts."
2172,Perfect ending for the mcu brought all 22 films together
2173,Marvel just keeps delivering. This a fantastic topper for the 21 previous movies as well as establishing more for the future. And apparent plot hole have been quickly filled by the writers.
2174,Its an awsome movie...every over should watch it who likes sci fie movies..
2175,JUST GO AND WATCH IT. ITS A MASTERPIECE AAAAA A A A A A A A A A A A A A A AA A. A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A AA A. A A A A A A
2176,"This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. Visuals, the actresses and actors, and plot. Everything linked up. I love this film and would recommend it to anyone."
2177,"I Just expected better than that, some shots are rather poor I was waiting for a breathtaking movie, but I didn't get.. anyway, still nice movie"
2178,"I have a strong sentimental attachment for the MCU. I watched the movies for 11 years, and this was almost like a breakup for me. Infinity War was one of my best movie experiences, i was beyond shocked, exited and emotional. And happy, beacause no movie of the mcu has accomplished that in me, and was because the bad guy wins (happy endings got boring honestly), all those uncomfortable one-line jokes and witty remarks were few, all the encounters and character development were meaningful and wonderful set, and the battles, my god, the battles were so epic, so imginative and so so great. all of what this movies lacks. it´s 3hrs of pure emotion, with a bad written story and not particularly appealing visuals. It seems as if they went with the first draft of the scrpit. i can´t understand all the glory this movie gets. I feel very ripped off"
2179,"Trying not to spoil anything about this movie will be the hardest thing i'v done. So many points that just hit home and as of now all i want to do is talk about those moments, but, i wont cause this is my spoiler free review and that's why ill sound vague, what i can say is that this movie was a raid, crazy one, it kicked you when you were down and then found a way to get you up and running just so it could shut you down. OVER AND OVER. And not once i thought ""yea that bs im not falling again i know whats coming"" nope they balanced it just as well as thanos balanced his knife in A:IW. I'm sure i can find flaws in this movie and if i'm really honest no movie is 10/10... But the thing is, I don't want to it was an amazing conclusion for the journey i'v been on for the last 11 years and i wouldn't end it any other way for ME it was a perfect ending for ME no flaw or minor plot hole could ruin the feelings this movie sparked and so for ME it was a 10/10. perfect movie."
2180,This movie was the best avengers movie and I think it wrapped up the Captain America and iron man storyline very well. This movie was very emotional. The movie did not feel like 3 hours long it felt like a one hour movie . Overall great movie and great Characters really enjoyed it.
2181,"I really love this endgame movie, every scenes are awesome."
2182,"I will not tell you anything about the plot, simply because almost everything in it can be considered as a spoiler, but I can convey my attitude. It was neither good nor bad.[換行字元][換行字元]The plot is linear, simple and predictable. Classic Marvel.[換行字元][換行字元]There was a lot of humor in the movie. Too much, especially considering the atmosphere of loss and hopelessness, which was at the end of the ""Infinity War"" and which one is trying to get to believe here.[換行字元][換行字元]And I liked the final action scene.[換行字元][換行字元]So in fact, I have nothing more to say about this movie. An entire era has passed. This is just the end.[換行字元][換行字元]This is endgame."
2183,This film was hyped so much i couldn't wait to watch it....the film is good but i didnt get the wow factor i had when i watched infinity war.....all the trailers and the online leaks wasted the ending for me....i still love marvel movies and will go see every one that comes out but for me this was good but not as good as I/W
2184,"Epic !!! What a ride , some really heavy scenes as our heroes battle with their sense of guilt from losing to thanks previously As they pick themselves back up theirs some great laughs and interactions with older selves once they find a way to manipulate time The final battle scenes on earth ate truly amazing and and the original Avengers stand their ground and go for to toe against the mighty thanos Captain Marvel battlefield entrance is spectacular and what a brilliant conclusion as the batan is passed from old to new"
2185,I slept during movie first time in my entire life.I can bare any kind of movie in my life but this was litery garbage movie. My humble request is to stay at home give time to ur family dont waste money on this movie.
2186,"If you've been following Marcel cinematic universe for more than 5 years, this movie will probably become your favorite movie, it potentially can be one of the greatest movies of all times , so give your reviews !"
2187,"For a marvel fan that willing to spending hours to rewatch all mcu movies to prepare for endgame, Endgame is all the dream i had wish for marvel to release. The combinations is just indescribable feeling. All the emotions and the characters feeling are in one place. It's worth it too watch it in the theaters more than 1 time. Also, the idea and easter eggs is interesting. ILY3000 TONY STARK"
2188,Robert downey jr is the best actor I've ever seen ever. Hope he'll comeback one day as a Grandpa in iron man legacy. Love this mcu studios
2189,Although it's a slow build all the emotional investments count in a film that is more about the characters we've come to love as they work through loss rather than the next battle they'll fight. Each of our original heroes complete their arcs. A fitting end to a mammoth undertaking.
2190,"Let's get this straight from the start: Infinity War is far more entertaining and a better film overall.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is a nice way to send off the storyline with a fan service movie, giving some nice nostalgia for the previous Marvel films in the series and the characters we've come to know and love, but there are many problems with the overall plot and film itself.[換行字元][換行字元]It would take quite a while to go in to it in too much detail, but to put it simply: Infinity War was also a long movie, but never felt long. I check my watch after what turned out to be 1 hour of Endgame and couldn't believe there was still another 2 hours to go.[換行字元][換行字元]It's possible I'd hyped it up to myself too much beforehand, but even then, plot points would have annoyed me regardless. I'd say the overall feelings afterwards were: nostalgic, sad (I admit to some tears), happy, ""it was alright""... but ultimately a little disappointing and frustrating."
2191,"After watching Avengers Endgame twice I can honestly say that it is the BEST marvel film to date. Without giving anything away, which is very hard, this movie is very emotional and intense. I have been a fan of this franchise since the beginning and this is the best ending they could've came up with. The way this movie plays out is not how I would've expected and I love that. It truly is Marvel's victory lap. While it is long it is very worth it. There has never been a movie like it before, with 21 films worth of build up, and there will most likely never be a movie like this again. As I said I've seen it twice and plan to go as many times as I can. It is a one of a kind experience. AND for the love of god don't spoil it for other people or yourself!!!! The best way to watch this movie with a clear mind. Free of any spoilers. If you do this, you are in for a real treat!"
2192,"Endgame is the best Avengers movie, hands down, and one of the best Marvel movies so far. Someone who has only watched one or two MCU movies before going to watch Endgame is basically going in blind. You won't find the symbolism of this movie unless you've watched all the previous movies, but especially the Captain America, Iron Man and Thor franchises. Things come full circle in the end and it's an emotional movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Before watching Endgame, I read many opinions on it and I have to agree that the movie is not uniformly paced. Personally, I like it this way. Some things felt rushed, yes, but it leads to the overall tone of the film; desperation. Things get a little sloppy when you get desperate.[換行字元][換行字元]Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth were amazing, as always, and provided memorable performances, with Tony Stark and Thor providing comic relief from time to time. I love that every Marvel movie finds a balance between humour and action and love. At the end of the day, Endgame's a very human movie that teaches us to do the right thing, even if it hurts us; to fight for the ones we love; and to live without regrets."
2193,"No spoilers here, although I would struggle to drop a spoiler as this film is surprisingly complex for a super hero film. But then Marvel / Disney have redefined cinema as we know it with these 22 films and this film caps off all of it in spectacular fashion. Expect to laugh hard and maybe even cry. One amazing, epic end."
2194,I had higher expectation from this movie but it turned out to be superheroes drama/comedy mixed with little action. There was very little action in the movie compare to past Avengers. 3d effects were not up to mark either. I was fairly disappointed by this one. If drama is your genre then go for it but if you like action then skip it.
2195,"This is a masterpiece. Don't listen to the bad reviews they have no idea what they are talking about. This is great at showing character development, especially with Tony Stark. Probably the best movie I have ever seen."
2196,"I have watched the first part many, many times. Every minute of it was accounted for with importance to the plot - not wasted on snowflake emotions.[換行字元][換行字元]This second half has an excellent plot, but oh, my - how it dragged on with talk and tears![換行字元][換行字元]I also didn't like Pepper suddenly being outfitted as a fighter?! lol! And, considering the future hero roles revealed in this one, can we eventually expect a white Black Panther, too?! Don't get me wrong - I don't want to see a white Black Panther.[換行字元][換行字元]Several other points of disappointment, too.[換行字元][換行字元]Bummer."
2197,"Honestly couldn't have ended it better. Wrapped up a few incomplete stories, and ended it in the most beautiful way possible. Kudos to the Russo brothers, the movie is hands down the best I've ever watched."
2198,Truly is the crown jewel of the MCU. Could not have asked for a better ending to such an amazing story spanning the past 11 years and 21 movies
2199,"A must see...CGI was outstanding, acting great! The heroes made you love them even more. What a ride, so glad I jumped on board."
2200,"Pros[換行字元][換行字元]You wont notice the time. 3 hours??

2201,"The alternate title for this film: ""How to Cram a 90 Minute Movie Into 3 Hours."""
2202,"This movie was definitely a 10/10. So much action, suspense, and a lot of emotion. I am not one to cry, but some scenes especially the death scenes made me feel like I might. Make sure to stay for the after credit scene. Once the first set of credits are over, the after credit scene will role. It is more of a tribute to the original avengers though. After that there is nothing else but credits."
2203,Such a payoff to the past 11yrs. Everyone needs to see it ASAP!
2204,"Incredible, one of the best films I have ever seen."
2205,I am in love with this film completely. The whole film left me completely depressed but satisfied with the ending
2206,This film is a very satisfying finale to 11 years of build up. The acting as always is amazing. The film as some great action sequences (especially the final fight). The film is able to combine the comedy that most of the other marvel universe films have and has very emotional drama. Overall Avengers:Endgame is a spectacular conclusion to the infinity saga that also has a lot of great fan service packed in to it and it does not drag even with a 3 hour runtime.
2207,"Hulk's glasses appear and reappear routinely from shot to shot without any shots of him putting them on or taking them off. In any event, with so many magical superpowers floating about ... one would think that Bruce Banner shouldn't have myopia or need to go to the opticians (on a buy one get one free basis) to get two sizes of glasses."
2208,"This met and exceeded ALL my expectations! The filmmakers made damn sure that each and every loose end was tied. And they also made sure to give us just enough to imply that it's not over, that we will see more of some of these characters. It was full of excitement, thrill, laughter and heartbreak. I am not exaggerating when I say that this is probably the movie of the decade, hands down. It's fun, perfectly paced, thrilling and all around perfect for a fan that's been watching these characters for 11 years. Thank you MCU for making every hour I spent watching these movies worth it."
2209,"Another fantastic work by Russo brothers. This film definitely deserves to be the 19th best movie yet. From the soundtrack to the effect and plot, everything was spot on. The cast, Chris Evans and Robert Downey jr. did the they homework and they delivered in their every second of the movie. I don't want to contain spoilers but I have to tell you will be shocked like I was after leaving cinema."
2210,"Well, I never thought I would be in a movie theatre where men and woman were crying in a superhero movie, but it happened. Robert Downey gave his best performance to date imho. Cheering, laughing, crying, and a good old fashioned round of applause at the end, says it all. A very good movie, I scored 8.5. I would definitely go and see it again, after I did I might give it a 9. Fitting finale to a fantastic franchise"
2211,"It is one of the films that you must see before death. After that you can stare to somewhere and say, well, it has everything, yes i expected more but it had everything which it must have."
2212,"Endgame is certainly one of its kind. A movie that will be marked as the film of this decade. Building up from Iron Man to Captain Marvel, a 10 journey filled with joy, adventure and tears. And we need a perfect ending to all of that. Endgame is the perfect ending. A movie that has everything a fan will ever dream of, an amazing cast and a wonderful climax. It is such a huge payoff from 10 years worth of building up. To look at this from a Fan's perspective, it is an awesome movie and it is a masterpiece. But to look at this from a critic's perspective, it is not the best movie. It certainly lacks some elements to a perfect movie. But this to me, is such a wonderful movie and I definitely loved it. It has everything I wanted and I'm gonna give this movie a 9/10."
2213,"Pretty sure Robert Downey Jr got his lines wrong. What he clearly meant to say is back to the future is clearly a way better depiction of time travel. Long gone are the days where movies had real emotional empathy and believability, they must have got washed up in the shores of time. Great Scott, if only we could go back to when these film had tangible sets and characters with substance and weight. This movie begins where infinity war left off with half the population doing a disappearing act, involuntarily of course. Our main protagonist Iron Man is lost in space and somehow found out of nowhere with very little reason. The new kid on the block has a talent for picking out people from space with, with her arms, or so it would appear. Eat your heart out superman!! Yet we are willing to let most this go, the task of expanding the universe further seems exhausting enough. With a barrel load of character to tackle not even three hours can save this mess. Maybe because they have to stick to their Hollywood Marvel formula and get the routine thirty minute, am I watching a kid play Mortal Kombat? Battle scene in!! The only thing missing is the vintage finish him voice at the finale. Reminence of the battle scene in ""ready player one"" springs to mind. Don't misinterpret me I don't mind a well built up epic conclusion but unfortunate this felt like a reversal of what had already materialised in the previous outting. As far as character and acting goes our main bunch handled themselves to the usual standard. We had nice chemistry wisecracks and charisma throughout the film and with regards to pacing it's a little slow to start off with. It's a good thirty to forty five of we're getting the band back together!! Without giving too much away it is a very linear one dimension story but still packs a bit of a punch with some humour and emotion from time to time. With regards to empathy I felt more for the characters towards the end than in the early stages. I felt like they failed at the start where you should feel really sad for the friends they lost but they all seemed to have moved on five years on. Scarlett Johansson's character was the only one who made me feel like it had actually happened. Overall it was an average finish, nothing to go to mad about."
2214,"Just watch it. Even if you can't afford it, just sell your kidney it's worth it believe me."
2215,"This movies is the best movie that I ever saw even better then infinity war in few level, I was so excited to see the movie."
2216,"I have been with Marvel for the past decade and have loved their movies. After watching Infinity War, I was devastated. End Game is even better than that film in every way. I won't spoil the movie for you but I can assure you that you are going to love every single moment of this film. There are so many epic moments that you are going to witness. You will laugh and cry every now and then. It is a wild ride from beginning to end. It reminded me why I love movies. Just go and watch it on the biggest IMAX screen possible, if you can get the tickets."
2217,I dan't believe this only has an average rating of 8.8. Probably the best movie in it's genre.
2218,"I loved it - anybody that went into this movie and didn't love it, I don't know why honestly - you laugh, cry and just are happy at the end :)"
2219,"As much as we might miss some of the characters who died in Infinity war, this avengers movie was not necessary. The story ended perfectly in last movie. I feel that this was an effort to bring back lost characters for whom most of the little boys and girls cried for in last movie... and in doing so, making tons of mistakes and dynamics change that made it near unwatchable. As much as it upsets people, Thanos was always right. And this was just a sad attempt in making him the unreasonable bad guy... sad."
2220,"During any adventurous and thrilling journeys, the ultimate goal is to reach the destination.. But often when we reach the destination, no matter how beautiful it is, we realize that it was the journey which was more special which led us to this destination...[換行字元][換行字元]Something similar happened with me after following the journey of Marvel Cinematic Universe aka MCU and witnessing the destination in the form of #Endgame...[換行字元][換行字元]Apart from being the culmination of past 21 movies, for me, Endgame stands out the way it treated our favourite superheroes by focusing on their vulnerable human side.

2221,No words can express my feelings right know ... the movie is beyond words ... i spent the half of it crying ... man it's godly awesome ... a movie to remember ... thanks Marvel
2222,"First, half of ""universe"" died and the rest can't go on, all heroes was crying without a life sense. Can't believe that. A child on a bicycle angry ¿for what? He was too young to loose the faith. The humanity always rise after a war, even if they lost the war, Germany, URSS, Jews, Spain, Japan. Terrible film message.[換行字元][換行字元]Second, all the effort to bring out the Captain Marvel before the endgame and with the hope in her to solve the Thanos issue. For nothing, Captain Marvel do nothing... all expectations for nothing.[換行字元][換行字元]Action only until the end, the rest of the movie was boring.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank god Marvel is over, no need to know nothing about Marvel Universe. It was almost a bad addiction finally cure."
2223,"This is a movie that you can greatly enjoy.[換行字元][換行字元]That being said, what we are seeing here with the ratings is far from the truth of what the movie delivered. We see a lot of problems with this movie that I even dare to say, were not present in Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]Major plot holes with the story and the way they try to ""explain"" what's happening is dissapointing. A very weird pacing giving you this very different movie feeling between the first 2 hours and a half and the last half hour. And the worst part of the downsides, I would say, is the fact that the movie is incredibly predictable. In infinity war they were able to deliver more than a few decision making/plot twists/situations you were not expecting at all, but they failed to deliver even a single one in this movie. You can know exactly what is about to happen through pretty much the entire movie, as well as with the fan service moments.[換行字元][換行字元]The comedy was better in this movie than in rest of the Avengers movies, or individual movies of MCU related to them. The way they wrapped up the stories of the characters is very good too, and the last 10 minutes of the movie are amazing.[換行字元][換行字元]Bottom line, it is a very enjoyable movie with some great moments...but it does not deserve an incredibly high rating (coming almost entirely from die hard fans with no arguments), major awards nominations, or even a place above its predecessor, Infinity War."
2224,"I think it was a fitting ending. Some emotional play and pulling at heart strings but I think the Russo brothers got the story-telling wrong here. It does appear as though they ran out of ideas for Endgame since all the great ideas were used up for Infinity War, which I think was a way better film in every sense.[換行字元][換行字元]I think if most were honest with themselves, they would agree that this wasn't really a good film but gave it a 10 anyway due to the emotional connection and Endgame being, well...the end."
2225,"A fitting way to launch the next phase of the Marvel Universe, so satisfying and the 3 hours disappeared in a blink of an eye. Will definitely watch again in general release."
2226,"Though the movie is decent, it in no way compares to Infinity War which was at least twice as good. This movie had two hours of boredom followed by a great third act. Wish they could of done this for the entire 3 hours vs just the last hour."
2227,I watch probably 1 movie on an average every week from last 3 years and have watched a lot of boring movies but this is the first time I could not watch a movie to the end Can't be more boring movie then this
2228,"The best superhero movie ever, spectaculer, happy, sad, funny, unexpected, and more. That's what describes this movie."
2229,The words can never describe how awesome the movie was. I brought my own diaper to last the 3 hour movie.
2230,Excellent movie experience but only for marvel fans
2231,I dont think that anyone could have done this better than the Russo Brothers. Thank you so much for this epic ending. I have left a piece of my heart by watching this. Cant wait to watch it again. WHATEVER IT TAKES!
2232,Just AMAZING AMAZING AMAZINGLY TALENTED GUYS WHO ARE THE ONLY REASON FOR THIS ONE I THINK I WILL BE GOING BACK
2233,"I will write this without giving a single spoiler. As many of us Marvel fans have started this journey over 10 years ago, I can confidently say that we have grown up and grown so very attached to each character. We've connected with these Superheroes on so many levels, love, joy, happiness, and so many laughs. I'm usually a tough critic with movies, but I cannot say any other than this wasn't just an amazing Marvel movie; But an amazing movie in general. Every aspect of this movie brings you so much closer to the Hero's we fell in love with as children and showed us why they are hero's. This is a must watch Movie. And as funny as this sounds, this Superhero movie was Beautiful, thought invoking, motivational and so very loving. We could not have asked for anything better. Lastly I will say is, Marvel gave us a perfect start to the world of Marvel and most importantly a complete and perfect start. I honestly want to thank every single person involved with this masterpiece and say how much I appreciate what we e been given."
2234,"I watched the movie yesterday but I didn't give a review because I couldn't think of what to say, until now. Avengers Endgame is truly an awesome and perfect finale for the past 22 movies in 11 years. The end to such a grand saga couldn't have been better. The movie is epic and out of the world. The hardwork of the cast and the whole crew can surely be seen in the movie. The audience wasn't expecting such an amazing ending to the infinity saga. The movie has perfect amount of action, comedy, emotion and the flashbacks and the references to the previous MCU movies truly culminated the 11 years journey. The end of the saga couldn't have been better."
2235,"The movie just perfect, from the story,visual,acting,and the battle are just perfect, this is movie in generation, must watch quckly."
2236,"A film with a great closure but that does not surpass its predecessor in terms of quality refers to it, although it is true that we should not let go of fanaticism the film is good but it is not to be considered a jewel or that it is above several cult movies"
2237,This is one of the best action/superhero movies I have ever seen. It wraps the infinity saga up real good.
2238,Infinity war was way better. Infinity war was way better.
2239,"Avengers Endgame, as insanely hyped as it was, had 3 hours to show an incredible wrap to 10 years of the MCU. It was unique and all the people saying many aspects of the movie were ""predictable"" are not necessarily correct. Endgame brought surprises other Marvel movies couldn't have done at it's supreme extent. Personally, I caught myself finding the movie less predictable than predictable towards its core plot. This movie is a must see, and you will find yourself captivated all the way through.[換行字元][換行字元]😇 Thank you for this masterpiece, Marvel 😇"
2240,"One of the best movie I've ever watched easily, not a 10/10 but very close."
2241,"Less action, too many drama, and not all heroes in super hero modes, no twisted ending .. little boring."
2242,"No spoilers here. Story is unexpected and very original. If you thought you knew what will happen - well, you were wrong. First half is a bit slow, but still interesting, with all the small pieces coming together. Second part is full time action, almost as good as Infinity Wars, but a bit weaker in details. I do miss more of Dr. Strange more, but, on the other hand, Captain America was much better than expected. Humor was good, as always.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, this is a great movie and a decent ending to the saga. I think everyone will be satisfied."
2243,"From 2008 to 2019, the journey of MCU has been the greatest experience i have ever had. The introduction of all the characters in every movie is so compelling that it touches your heart. The ""Avengers: Endgame"" is the tribute to those 21 titles that made this story more exciting. This is the end of one era. I'll miss all the geniousness(Iron Man), the god(Thor), the positive attitude(Cap), the green guy(of course you know), the agent (Nat and Clint), the ""that's the endgame up there"" guy(Thanos), the overpowered girl(Captain Marvel), and of course Nick Fury, The Lazy lads(Guardians), The Witch(Dr. Strange), the stark son(Spider-man), Ibambe(Black Panther) and every other characters involved in the MCU. I can't live without the science fiction, comedy, tragedy, drama, action, relationships, goose bump experience, super secret boy band, the break ups and patch ups, the love, the hate, the anger, the vibes, the post credit scenes, the hopes, the surprises, the craziness and fan theories, the friendships, the hero, the villain, the unexpected dissappearence, the tragic deaths, the cameos of Stan Lee. They complete Marvel.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you Robert Downy Jr., who started it all. Thank you Stan Lee. Thank you Kevin Feige.

2244,"I really did. The writers just continued to made changes to characters that were convenient for their story. Just like in Infinity War. And why such a spotlight on a single character, while others are barely seen in the movie. Too many plot holes, inconsistencies, and overall character changes. Disappointed :("
2245,"Worst than Batman VS Superman infinity war is better than this movie, please bring back my money !!!!!"
2246,"The only word I could muster after the screen cut to black was ""Unbelievable.""[換行字元][換行字元]The Marvel Cinematic Universe is an achievement in film like we've never seen before, and Avengers: Endgame is the perfect culmination of this journey we have been on over the last decade. I genuinely cannot comprehend a more perfect way to end this story along with several character arcs.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame takes all of the best things from the previous 21 films and packs them seamlessly into the 3-hour runtime that still somehow leaves you wanting more. All of the main characters give pinnacle performances here (one in particular, which you might have a guess but I will refrain from saying here).[換行字元][換行字元]Hours later, I am still mostly speechless. Nothing else I can put into words will be able to do this film justice. You simply have to experience it for yourself.[換行字元][換行字元]If you're a lifelong Marvel fan, you will swoon over this film. It will touch your heart. It will go down in history. Now stop what you're doing and go experience Avengers: Endgame."
2247,"Avengers endgame is phenomenal, not only is the pace and score absolutely polished to perfection but it's everything a fan would ever want it to be. There are only so many words that can describe the pure sense of this film and that's because they're simply an understatement. Avengers endgame is the glorified film of all time and it met every single expectation, and then some. The character arcs are not fulfilled else where like in other films apart from what we've seen in the MCU for the past 11 years, that says something...that deserves something. I give Avengers Endgame a 10/10, to add to that I give the MCU a new scale, simply because it's in a realm of its own. A enjoyable rollercoaster that chokes you up in the end. All good things come to and end, and this is this is it."

2249,"Wow. Simple and pure. I started this journey watching Iron Man 1 back in 2008, and left the cinema thinking finally, a super hero movie done right. Reflecting everything I loved about comics and enabling me to relive my childhood on the big screen. 11 years later Marvel brings out the endgame. A beautiful conclusion and tribute to what has been a joy for me to be partake over the past 22 movies. Given the sheer amount of characters in the mcu, they have done brilliantly giving every one heroic screen time and really embracing each of the characters as best as possible. I was in tears at the end. Not out of sadness but out of pure gratefulness and joy of having experienced this journey. Endgame is a masterpiece in terms of entertainment and concludes this generation of heroes in the most appropriate way possible. This was the star wars of my generation and honestly I can't help feel a tinge of sadness of how things turned out in the end, but simultaneously so grateful and content with how it was done. All in all, I just wanted to say Thank you. Thank you for making an incredible series of movies and really doing justice to my childhood and to the marvel universe. Avengers....Assemble"
2250,I have never ever cried at a film....... until now. The most incredible and thrilling movie I have encountered. Marvel could not have made this film any better. They captured every moment perfectly. I really can not put into words just how fantastic this film is!
2251,"The ending is unique and earned. Very few series finales end with this much gravitas, you definitely do not want to miss this!"
2252,"This movie is incredible, I watched twice in theatre, This movie helps you to feel, Pain, Anger, Sadness, Happiness. The action scenes were another level even you can't imagine the last fight scenes.[換行字元][換行字元]I miss you, Natasha,"
2253,Watched the digital download today. 10 years in the making and it was everything I hoped it would be and more
2254,"The plot was messy, and so vast, with so many amazing characters, who were all simply diluted into one giant mess of a movie. Didn't really find the humour amazing either."
2255,"If you're going for the Avengers film to expect action, Endgame may disappoint you a bit. It's not as packed with action as some of the other MCU & Avengers movies are. However, it does have a good storyline. It just seems a bit slower in the first half. Now many do say that plot development is crucial too. People need to relate to it emotionally. And that completely valid and I agree with them. However, there are times where the plot development seems way too long winded. Regardless, this was the Finale and it stood up too its expectations. So all in all a great movie!"
2256,It was an endgame -the toughest villan always makes a great movie -thanos was one of them
2257,"Im not a huge Marvel fan, but i like to watch their movies, and after seen Infinity War, i can say, this was worst. The first couple of hours was just fill time and i wasnt enjoying that much. The last hour, with the battle and all the events, it trully become really good. So, a 7 for hour 1 and 2, and a strong 9 for the last."
2258,A film like that can't be made again Such a beauty
2259,"So many others have captured how I felt about this movie, that regurgitating what they said would lessen their impact. So all I want to say is that this movie was slow, disjointed, badly executed in writing and a complete disappointment. Even my 9 year old grandson said it sucked. Sad...."
2260,"This is the only way I can describe the movie. It's like the directors and producers all got together and really listened to the fans. They really understood the perfect ""ending"" to this masterpiece. Of course there will be more movies, but there will never be something as big as this. I sat in the theater and laughed, cried, yelled, cheered, and just had an amazing experience. This is what the movies are all about. I won't include any spoilers, but I encourage people to see it. I plan on going a few more times. It was the perfect ""ending"" for this phase. I'm really interested to see where Marvel goes and what they will do, but I'm sure I'll be in attendance when they make their return. As a comic book fan, I couldn't have asked for a better movie. I'm still in awe!"
2261,Never thought I would give a ten to a movie but damn that was a good ending
2262,"'Avengers: Infinity War' undeniably impressed me, given it's cliffhanger ending. I was anxious to see 'Endgame' and see how things wrapped up. As you know, the plot consists of the heroes trying to patch things up after Thanos' destruction. I will try not to give too much away in this review, because spoilers can be, well, spoiling![換行字元][換行字元]While the film is quite exciting and surprising things do happen, all I could think about was getting to the end, when everything fell into place. The final outcome was not what I would've done with the story, but it's nothing to complain about. Also appearing is a peanut butter sandwich (you'll see).[換行字元][換行字元]It's quite exciting and full of both drama and humor, along with cameos from characters we haven't seen in a long time. It's acted fine, nonetheless I still think the performances in 'Infinity War' were far superior, for some reason.[換行字元][換行字元]However, I found that I didn't enjoy this installment as much as 'Infinity War'; I suppose not being a full-on Marvel fan made me surprised but not too sad when characters died then. I was simply impressed with how plot developments were actually made! Marvel usually suffers from 'nothing ever happens' disorder, where they get too afraid to make something big occur for fear it will upset the fans. In that department, 'Endgame' is also an improvement.[換行字元][換行字元]It may be the end of the explosive, cast-of-thousands Marvel movies, but it's of course not the end of stand-alones and spin-offs. 'Avengers: Endgame' is a fine little movie, but I know regardless of what I've said in this review you'll see it anyway. So I say, ""Have fun."""
2263,"Avengers endgame is the end of the infinity saga and it is the perfect ending. I may not be good with words but this movie was amazing! I am seeing it again tomorow for the 7th time! It is a little slow in the first hour, but it makes up for it because I am invested in these characters. I am happy with what they did with Thor and hulk because it makes sense in the context of their character ark. Thanos in this movie is not as good as he is in infinity war but that was the same with the heroes. Captain America for example was not very good in infinity war but now he is amazing in endgame. People like infinity war for the villain, and I think people should like endgame for the heroes. After all, these are superHERO movies!"
2264,This is realy end game the end of each movie in mcu all spoils are for the beginning of the movie you can't imagine what will happen
2265,Maybe my expectations were too high but in the end this move was just OK. It isn't bad - and it is a must see if you are invested in the Marvel Universe - but it isn't great. Maybe it gets lost in trying to include too many characters or maybe is Disney trying to be PC and intentionally make it try to appeal to too many people but in the end it made it less interesting. It has its crowd cheering moments and is epic - but when the big spoilers happen I almost didn't care. Hopefully Marvel can reboot with the X-men and Fantastic 4 because the current group has run its course.
2266,"AE is the Final battle of Infinity Saga which concluded the story of every movie since 2008. The time travel explanation was good.It felt like Inception. The ending was the most fulfilling for Iron Man and Captain America. This movie couldn't have been better. The only problem with this movie was with the dubbed version in Hindi, they made the crap out of it, it was the worst dubbing ever. Please Marvel India take this into consideration. Love you 3000"
2267,"Slow and ponderous with little or no character development or display of the talents they are supposed to have until the end of the film. The plot or storyline is simple and dull. I fell asleep in the film and my only regret is that I woke up and then had to watch the rest of the film, boring and predictable and will not engage you if you have a mental age of over about 16 or under"
2268,"It takes some time to get going. Then there is this obsession to try to be funny, that is sometimes a bit annoying. The Final Battle is way to overloaded and that not very subtile feministic scene at the end of the battle is kind of pathetic (you will get what I mean, when you see it). I love female superheros, but that particular scene doesn't make sense at all. Please stop ruining good movies, with political statements. It's worth a watch, no doubt, but I was kind of disappointed. Its way to melodramatic for a freaking superheromovie."
2269,"I have watched it thrice now. Was excited all 3 times. This movies is ""America's Ass"" bloody amazing. Triggers all emotions and I felt them all even when I watched it for the third time. This movie is everything you would want and even more. Russo brothers are legends. I don't know how they pull of something this great making sure the movie gave importance to each and every character in it.... I know how hard it can be when u got a lot of superheroes in one movie and you got to make sure u don't screw it up. Russo,s did not... Thank you for this.[換行字元][換行字元]Such a great way to end this journey. What an ending! ENDGAME"

2271,I LOVE MARVEL!!! This movie is incredible!! I just wish Stan lee was here to see everything he had worked to create!!
2272,"Thor is like a God. He and hulk are the strongest in all and what the hell you did with them. After infinity war, Thor and hulk must have a epic battle with Thanos but what we get, disappointing. Thor's power are like useless also his get up.....hell. storm breaker is lifted by Thanos and he is killing Thor by it, what the hell is this. Why this much disgrace to Thor. It is an emotional movie but it must have epic action, this is for what I am watching marvel movies from a decade but unfortunately and I am very disappointed with the end game. They hype was at the sky after the epic battles in infinity war and what we get in end game, a kind of a love story. Why don't we watch 50 shades of white then.."
2273,This movie should not exist. Please remake it. Infinity war was much better. I was kind of suspicious when they started promoting it so much.[換行字元][換行字元]We need better ending to all these years of loyalty. So many things in this movie are unreasonable. Why why why
2274,A well made collaboration of masters pieces which turn out to be an extraordinarly Marvellous Masterpiece movie of all time . Thank you Russo brothers ....
2275,"Indulgent rubbish. Do yourself a favor and just watch infinity war because this film is boring and by the end, I just did not care anymore!"
2276,Loved the integration of all the heroes and the way it ended
2277,"After 11 years of build up something big was definitely going to happen,but this movie took my expactions and doubled it.Dont't watch it if you haven't seen the rest of the MCU movies.You need to know everything so this film can have the biggest impact."
2278,"No words to explain, but the movie is its own worth. 1000000 stars ✨."
2279,"From the moment I saw the idiotic quantum tbeory scene, I realized that there the movie depended on a lot of bull sh to weave a crazy plot over different time zones and eras and different planets."
2280,"God damn I laughed and I cried and I laughed and I cried, now I'm watching it for the second time, probably the third, I can't even remember how many times...."
2281,A befitting end to one of the greatest movie eras ever witnessed.
2282,A very decent ending keeping its Main Characters in the spotlight and not unnecessary focusing on the sundry avengers..[換行字元][換行字元]Cheers.....
2283,"I liked the first half a lot,there were many funny moments that worked (mainly overweight Thor and Rocket) mixed with good action. The second half turned more to the emotional side and some moments didn't make sense at all (main characters left alone by the aliens to have a heartfelt dialogue in the middle of a battle),it kept dragging on and on much like the last 20 min of LOTR return of the king making sure all main characters get a proper emotional ending. Bottom Line : could have been the best MCU movie ever with a shorter second half and less emotional scenes. I still consider the first iron man and guardians of the galaxy the best MCU movies to date."
2284,"Overall a good movie and a great conclusion of the saga, but way to long, it could be easily in 1.5 hours."
2285,"I see most people who have decided to review Avengers: Endgame thought the movie was horrible, so I think this film deserves a better rep for those who have yet to see it. Endgame is the conclusion we have all been waiting for from the MCU, and personally I think Endgame did a brilliant job at giving the audience something to cry about, laugh about, smile about, and just love. Being a huge fan of the Marvel film franchise, I did not think that the ending this movie gave us was lacklustre, or less exciting than Infinity War. Personally, I would have to say this movie was even better than Infinity War, most likely due to the fact that it is the grand finale of all these movies, but honestly the movie was just that memorable. There was never a moment where I was bored during this 3 hour film. Whilst most people snark at the idea of sitting down for that long for a movie, once I had watched it I fully understood why it had to be that way. To finish this big of a legacy takes a lot of time, and within those 3 hours I could just feel myself submerge into the wider MCU one last time (needless to say, there will be plenty more Marvel movies), and I definitely enjoyed every part of it. This movie is definitely worth a watch if you like action, romance, heartbreak, and just an overall good story line. Avengers: Endgame definitely deserves it's praise and so much more."
2286,"It's not one of the best movies in The Avengers series, but it's appreciable. The movie is a bit slow and has less action than the previous ones. One thing I noticed is that the right leftist thinking has come to Marvel once and for all. I imagine the next movies will be based on such an ideology. The presence of Captain Marvel and her attitudes in the plot is proof of this."
2287,I Enjoy every minute of film. Greatest Avengrer movie. Heartouching in a few moments
2288,"Finally got around to watching this film. I wanted to like it... I'll stick with Logan , Deadpool and the gritty old Batman's. It's clear the direction Disney is going to take marvel and it's straight to cartoon land."
2289,"To start off, this movie is beyond perfect and incredible. The longevity seems troubling at first, but I can promise that they used every second of those three hours beautifully. When you thought 22 movies would have given the audience enough character development, then treated us to plenty more fulfilling story lines that guided us through the way to the end. Going on that note, if you haven't seen all of the movies, if you aren't a true fan, and if you're just going to this movie for the action, why waste your time? It will still be an incredible ride, but in order to get the best experience possible, you have to have that emotional connection and dedication. This movie will make it worth it all. Before seeing the movie, I was introduced to a few possible spoilers that ended up being true. Even if I knew for a fact that they were true, nothing can prepare you for the gut wrenching and beautiful moments that were captured. I absolutely recommend everyone to go through the marvel experience and see how these 11 years leaded up to one of the most amazing movie franchises in history."
2290,"Couldnt help feeling that Endgame is to Infinity Wars what Dark Knight Rises was to Dark Knight.[換行字元][換行字元]A good follow up but the bar was already set too high. Very entertaining, with a satisfying ending, but got there after quite a few plot holes and unanswered questions.[換行字元][換行字元]It felt like the writers wrote the ending first and then tried really hard to take us to that end, regardless of what plot holes they were forced to leave in the wake.[換行字元][換行字元]PS didn't really like what they did to Thor and Hulk. Good for laughs maybe, but the characters deserved better"
2291,"Absolutely heart breaking from beginning to end. I'm not going to sit here and spoil the movie for anyone, but if you love Marvel movies you'll love this."
2292,This movie is near perfect. I held my bladder for 3 hours. Thank you MCU. I felt like a kid again today. This is how superheroes movie is supposed to be.
2293,"If you see the extremely negative reviews that are very vague as to why they disliked the movie so much, they most likely didn't see the movie at all and have a beef with either certain cast members or producers of the film, or they are disgruntled employees of the film industry. Writing misleading reviews is a way they think they can ""stick it to the man"" although it doesn't really do a whole lot. Nevertheless, Endgame was a spectacular ending to the MCU (the first generation at least). It terms of HOW GOOD the movie is compared to other top marvel films, it's on the same level with Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther and Ragnarok. In my opinion, a sure fire contender for top 3 MCU films so far"
2294,"If u ever wonder this is has to go 3 hours? I'll tell you the can not cut any minute out of it. Every plot makes sense and storytelling is smooth, and above all, the process is unpredictable if you haven't been spoiled ofc"
2295,"The first half felt sappy and chatty. I found myself fighting the Zzzz in this first half. But the second half felt like a time travel thriller (a la mission impossible team). The climax with the actual battle was good, like epic battles we have seen before from the Marvel Universe. I was disappointed that there wasn't an end scene. I have grown accustomed to expect an end scene leading up to a new Marvel movie so I felt jipped watching the ending credits and not seeing an end scene. I think it's like a 6 3/4 out of 10 and I rounded it up to 7/10"
2296,"Infinity was one of the best films ever! This is a disgrace of a follow-up. Slow, elongated and boring. I sat through 1.5 hours and gave up, waiting for something to happen. My advice, do not bother!"
2297,"You must have already seen it, or you would see it this weekend.[換行字元][換行字元]Or you will see it this month, in worst case you may see it next month.[換行字元][換行字元]But you will see this movie at least once in your life, it's just that good."
2298,Nothing will prepare you for this movie. Nothing. It's a marvel. Bring tissues.
2299,"Can't believe how long this film was, it was far too long and far too spread out. The characters were overly simplistic and there was too much action scenes for the characters to really develop and show off their personalities. After the film I could barely get up it really made me and my lovely Mother's backsides very sore after sitting down for over 3 hours at once. Not only is this film immensely overrated but it hurts people's bums as well!"
2300,"There were some good points but there were also some very average and predictable points. The girl power moment was just so wrong, my wife even commented how bad that PC crap... So Marvel if your bringing that kind of 'me too'in to superhero movies. This is were I get off."
2301,"After the culmination of 22 films, all of everything before comes together. Did the film live up to the hype? Was it a satisfying experience? Did the film fulfill? That to me is the real question. Sure the film has flaws like every other movie and we will get to those in a minute, but that's what this review is going to try and answer, was I fulfilled? And will it potentially fulfill others? Well, let's delve into what I didn't like about this film. Firstly, there was no need for the film to be 3 hours long. There are so many scenes that could've been cut, lots of moments of exposition, and talking, some were important, some were uninteresting. This could've shaved off 30 minutes and it would have been fine. Also, there is several plot holes, and conveniences throughout, and I'm sure this happened before, but if it wasn't noticeable then, it sure is noticeable now. But that should be somewhat expected as this film crams in a 22 film plot. The first 2 hours are a bit of a drag, as there isn't much to sink my teeth into, there are some nice moments, but nothing amazing. That's as far as the negatives go, everything else is great. The last hour is perhaps the greatest hour of any superhero movie. It's epic, engaging, surprising, everything I wished the first two hours were like. The humor while not a heavy as Infinity War, is still funny, again displaying the talent of the writers for blending humor and drama. This film feels less crowded as Infinity War did, where you had 40 characters portrayed on screen, here is only 10 maybe, which allowed for more screen time with the characters, and with characters we have grown to love since 2008. The performances by each actor and actress are all top notch, but I think of all of them, the one that shined the most is Mark Ruffalo. He gave the best performance of all his appearances in the MCU thus far. Chris Hemsworth shows his more comedic side as Thor, and it feels more like the Thor in Thor: The Dark World, rather then Thor: Ragnorak. I'm a bit on the fence when it comes to the writing of the character, however. Robert Downey Jr. is the same he's always been, smarmy, snarky, and dry. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is more fleshed out, feeling she had a bigger role to play in this compared to her involvement in Infinity War. Overall, I really enjoyed this film. It's got some glaring issues for me to say I absolutely loved it, but it's a nice conclusion to this Infinity saga. One thing is for sure, this film is going to make a lot of money. I have never witnessed a film so incredibly hyped, we are going to witness history in films with all the records it's going break. If you haven't seen this already, I recommend you do, and get involved in the party. Go and enjoy!"
2302,Literally and purely the best movie ever made!!! ..................................................it is a must must watch not only for the marvel fans ofcourse but for everyone else out there l!!!
2303,"Cant imagine that i could ever see this amazing movie, its a three hours movie but it only feels like one hour! Every scene has its own characteristic that makes this movie very good!"
2304,"Avengers Endgame is truly one of the greatest movies of the MCU! The Russo brothers did an amazing job putting this all together. They thought of everything and no detail was overlooked. Even though the movie is quite different than Infinity War, I think they made the right choice in doing so. I'm sad this part of the journey is over but also couldn't wait anymore either ;)"
2305,It has the best story and the best effects that I ever seen in Marvel is the best movie with no comparative
2306,This movie was something more than just a superhero movie. In this movie we watch the will of superheroes after been defeated by Mad Titan Thanos. This movie portrays the best 11 years of the franchise in perfect way. Please watch this movie as soon as possible.
2307,"This is how you end a 10 year long story. They hit every button. Fan service, writing, acting. Literally every emotion is drawn out. The story is over but there's more to tell. Genius as in entertainment value and commercially. 22 movies and they still have billions dollars coming in the future. They've earned every penny."
2308,This film is a beautiful piece of work this review will not contain spoilers all I want to say is watch this film 😰
2309,This movie is perfect. its heartbreaking heartwarming and made with love
2310,"What a monumental movie & wonderful closure for a 11yrs Odyssey that is gonna be remembered as a legendary achievement on a cinematic standpoint. It is a magnificent love letter to all these emblematic characters & for us all, passionate fans of these universes."
2311,"My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library, about 11 months after we similarly watched ""Infinity War"" where Thanos wanted to destroy half the universe.[換行字元][換行字元]In fact the very first scene of this one depicts people, parts of families, just disappearing. Thanos is so powerful, and possessing all the infinity stones, would take a giant coordinated effort by all the Avengers to figure out a way to defeat him. And only some kind of time travel to secure each infinity stone would enable them to accomplish what is needed.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is long, very long, at just over 3 hours with the credits. We just can't watch a 3-hour movie in one sitting after steak and wine so we watched it over two consecutive nights.[換行字元][換行字元]It is a good movie, characterizations are very good, as is the inventiveness of the story line. The least interesting to me were the CGI-full epic, frantic battles. They just became audio and video ""noise"" to me. But the hand-to-hand fighting was much better, as were the actual interactions of various characters.[換行字元][換行字元]I don't see a listing for the next Avengers movie so is this the last one?"
2312,Loved it to bits. Saw it twice in one day. Perfect ending to the infinity saga and cant wait to see what is next.
2313,"From a comic fans perspective this may be a good movie, at least the last hour, but for an admirer of cinema it is a great disappointment. The first two hours are expendable. The Russos try to be schmaltzy like Spielberg and funny like Waititi without having either of their chops and so they fail badly. They may do certain visual things really good but overall it seems to be a too big to succeed idea, to try and tie up every single storyline. I may also add that a lot of really stupid stuff happens that takes you out of the movie. Bad timing of mediocre jokes and some ridiculous mistakes. The pay off for the soapy stuff comes way too late. This is a not a great movie, unfortunately."
2314,"This movie keeps you at the edge of your seat, especially on the second half of it.It will make you cry,shout,scream from excitement or frustration and even clap as if the movie is going to bow it's head and it almost feels like they knew you would act that way, with the right pauses at the right time. Even at its worst moments, the movie feels just good, not even reaching mediocrity . Ofcourse every movie has flaws or mistakes or a plot hole, but this movie does so many things right that you just don't care. Can a movie be perfect?No. Can it be amazing and worth watching over and over until it's engraved in your mind though? Yes it can and this movie is one of those. Those that will be remembered for generations to come."
2315,"Movie throughout was a bunch of thrill... Every 10 min from starting have something new.... Though I won't spoil anything.. Thus didn't like Thor's condition... And yes movie has a quite emotional ending... Have been watching all movie. Since 2008.. it was heartaching.. that my childhood favorite characters... Will not be there on screen... No Thor, no cap, no iron man, no black widow, no Hulk ..... Very emotional moment for me.. But hats off to everyone..."
2316,Movie : unbelievable good Story : Not that easy but necessarily! Pay attention to all the things the main characters do... or not do![換行字元][換行字元]Have fun! And look it twice
2317,The Best Marvel Movie Ever... .............................Nuf Said- Stand Lee
2318,I hate to see iron man in this movie frankly because of his real life character.
2319,"I don't believe it's a 10/10 . It's a 8-9/10 , but it's really worth to watch. The ratings are just overrated"
2320,"Go to the movies and watch, the best movie of the all time marvel, an incredible way to end this saga."
2321,First 45 minutes not bad advancing chapters very good especially battle scene legendary
2322,"It will make you laugh, sad, and get excited. the best one i've seen."
2323,This Movie was so awesome! I love how its live action and its really really good like infinity war. You should go see this
2324,You can't rate this movie because it's not a movie it's a saga of 15 Years a conclusion and you can't rate a conclusion you just watch and enjoy it.
2325,"The script was slow moving and often lazy. After being so precise and covering all the bases moving up to this movie, it seems Marvel really let go on this one. They left several loopholes unexplained. Overall the movie was worth watching, but I thought Infinity Wars was much better."
2326,"I managed to watch 40 minutes of this crap, and then could not stand it any longer. You must be a true fan of Marvel Universe to see it until the end. If you are not, avoid - nothing makes sense in this utterly boring movie. Acting is really bad too. High-end special effects cannot save it."
2327,Honestly this movie was special. I hardly think there will be anything like this in the future and you neeed ti see it and find out for yourself. It was a true masterpiece
2328,Didn't like this marvel movie and I didn't like the others
2329,3 hours went by in a flash! What an epic film. Hope it breaks all box office records and please let it be the first superhero movie to win an Oscar. It deserves it!
2330,One epic conclusion for all marvel fans . The series may be over but the Avengers' magic will live on. Watch it on the largest screen you can find and be part of something great .
2331,"The start of Avengers Endgame leaves every single spectator cold and sympathized locating them in a world after-the-snap where the emptiness that left those who have left and the pain of those who are still, have been present during five long years. Then, The Avengers discover a very risky posibility for bringing everybody back, but our heroes will try it ""Whatever it takes"". Followed by this discovery, Marvel transports us towards a ride through several of the events that ocurred in its cinematographic universe to gather again the infinity gems paying tribute to more than 10 years of films. After this trip that brings with it a very hight cost, we find ourselves with a spectacular and emotive third act full of an overwhelming fan-service that will never be forgotten by its fans, closing masterfully and uniquely the Infinity Saga. The movie came with very high expectations and managed not only to accomplish all of them, but to avercome more than enough them, and Marvel gives fans everything they have dreamed about. The only thing against this film is that it can never be equealed or overcome, locating it on the cusp of Marvel's cinematographic world and leaving too many hight expectations for later films that, even though, we know we'll love them as they always make us do."
2332,This movie is a amazing and the best ever movie i seen. I don't know why But i am very very like it
2333,"I was speechless when I see the ending of the battle. I would wish something better, but I don't know how a happier ending would make this film better."
2334,"The perfect conclusion, that pretty much sums it up. Over ten years and more then 20 movies led to this moment. Similarly to Infinity War, End Game had a lot of hype to live up to, and it did so seemingly effortlessly. The story, which on paper sounds quite simple, get the stones back and fix everything, takes some unexpected turns here and there and I have to applaud the filmmakers for making it so damn entertaining. The movie shines in being extremely funny, heartbreakingly sad and also filled to the brim with pulse-pounding action. The cast, which we know so well, all work with each other seamlessly. Special shoutout to Robert Downey Jr for giving by far his most vulnerable and amazing performance as Iron Man thus far. The climax of the film is one for the ages, similar to the final battle in Return of the King. The special effects, the score and the editing were naturally amazing, nothing less than expected from what these filmmakers have given us before. There is also plenty of fan service, sometimes a little too on the nose, but the plot and the characters are treated with the respect the Russo's have earlier shown to have for the franchise. Whatever turn the franchise takes after this, it will probably be exhilarating."
2335,Simply the very best of the best. Constructed to fulfill every single moment that began 10 years ago and brought us all to the finality we were anticipating. The Russo's nailed it with precision perfection. Complete satisfaction. #EXCELSIOR
2336,It's Everything. That's all I feel I need to say without spoiling anything. It was worth the wait and the build up of 22 films in 10 years. A fantastic end but also great start for the next Phase. #DontSpoilTheEndgame
2337,"So many great references and call backs to previous MCU movies.[換行字元]AMAZING final third of the movie[換行字元]even the predictable moments are great[換行字元]perfect ending to the first MCU saga, as well as a great set up to whatever marvel does next[換行字元]everything about this movie is important so avoid and any all spoilers if possible!"
2338,"A+, Epic, Amazing, Phenomenal. They tied the entire series of 21 movies together almost perfectly. Movie making at its absolute finest. The only question now is, how can Marvel ever top it?"
2339,"I'll try to keep spoilers out of this review. Endgame is, in my opinion, not necessarily the best film on its own from the MCU in terms of writing and storytelling. To me, that honor still belongs to Winter Soldier. But in terms of being the final chapter of what 21 movies have been building up, I gotta say, it was phenomenal and more than satisfying while also wanting you to still revisit these characters and see where they go from here.[換行字元][換行字元]After watching the film twice, I can say for sure now that it's by no means flawless. The first couple of hours drag on a bit too much, but damn the last act more than makes up for what they were building up towards. The film is chuck full of great fan service and action as well as emotional gut punches that I say with all honesty as a grown man made me bawl my eyes out.[換行字元][換行字元]Is the film perfect? Not by any means. There were certain plot elements I wasn't a fan of, and like I said, the build-up to the last act is kind of draggy. But in the end, the pay-off is SO worth it, and you owe it to yourself to see this film if you've been following this franchise especially since there beginning."
2340,Sobbed. So much to take in. No words. Gonna watch it a millionth time more these few weeks.
2341,"I've just got back from watching Endgame at a UK midnight release and I'm lost for words. This film had me laughing in hysterics and put a huge grin across my face during some unbelievable scenes. It made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and made my spine tingle and then also left me in an emotional wreck. No one will be ready for what they're about to see but what a ride it was, it's up there with Infinity War, if not better as it completes the whole 22 film Infinity Saga. The Russos are amazing, everyone of their MCU films are pretty much flawless, fantastic job guys.... WE'RE IN THE ENDGAME NOW!!!!"
2342,"Just saw it this morning (Australia) and wow, what an awesome movie. It is everything and more I wanted out of the final Avengers movies and it delivers on every level. Had great moments of humour, action and emotion. Can't wait to see it again!!"
2343,"Inferior to Infinity War, there were funny and exciting moments, but not as much as in IW"
2344,"This was obviously the best MCU film to date and im pretty sure everybody that saw this can agree. Without spoiling it there are some very sad moments but thats the most i can say. The whole story was great and it was just as good as any other great Marvel film. Even being a non-marvel kinda guy i actually liked the whole avengers series and i thought this was a good end to this 4 movie series. Watching these movies changed my mind about the whole MCU movies and i thought they were cool. Still not a huge fan but i enjoyed them for the most part. This movie is just a legend, enough said."
2345,"... and Marvel isn't her favourite.[換行字元][換行字元]Neither is it mine, in fact the more and more the marvel universe has expanded the more I have gotten disenchanted with it. Although I loved most of phase one and a lot of phase two, passed that I felt like it had gotten too much for me and the storylines have gotten more and more absurd, to the point where even my enjoyment of Infinity War was limited. Endgame though seems to be an anomaly.[換行字元][換行字元]The absurd storyline is still there, though the way it's carried out does make it fairly enjoyable, the plot holes are still there also and the four million backstories anyone but the most avid marvel fans would forget in an instant consistently make an appearance too, but all of this seems less important than previously.[換行字元][換行字元]Instead this fourth instalment keeps you gripped, and is perfectly paced, impressive considering it's length. For the entire three hours I was glued to the screen and the feeling that something big was in store never left. On top of this the storyline, I mean the bare bones of it, was genuinely really good, I never expected what was coming and felt sucked in to what was trying to be achieved.[換行字元][換行字元]But this was nothing on the finale, the grandeur of the final battle (this isn't a spoiler, everyone knows there's going to be a battle of sorts at the end) is something which only the greatest action/fantasy films have mustered. Plus the emotional ending was exactly that, genuinely emotional, I don't think anyone didn't feel a tug on the old heartstrings.[換行字元][換行字元]All in all, considering the twenty two films and the effort/hype put into it, surprisingly Endgame actually delivered, and the sense of expectancy you felt because of this being a conclusion of sorts, again surprisingly was actually delivered upon! Well done marvel![換行字元][換行字元]But far to say it's one of the best films of all time though..."
2346,I like it was great 10 years of my life. nuff said
2347,"Thoroughly wrapped up with incredible action, excitement, WOW'moments and humor - Avengers: Endgame delivers on it's promise by providing a truly epic conclusion (in the grandest fashion possible!) to 11 years of Marvel Cinematic Universe awesomeness. This one, indeed felt like an emotional roller-coaster ride, and managed to stage a perfect farewell that our beloved superheroes deserved. The Russo brothers have genuinely redefined the art of classic comic book storytelling and set the standards really, really high with their final installment. Despite the longsome 3hr length, the film is sooooo much enjoyable all over that it's quite impossible for anyone to get their eyes off the screen for even a split second. This is probably one of the most emotional films I've ever come across (surprisingly!), with tears in the corner of my eyes during the final moments and witnessing the whole crowd inside the theatre giving a standing ovation as it drew to a close. Endgame faithfully shines in every department, while honoring the past in an incredibly satisfying finale.[換行字元][換行字元]I feel that both 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame' are must-see events for every movie-goers, whether or not they've seen a Marvel film before. A round of applause for the film makers, cast & crew, all the backroom staff and anyone else who've helped to curate this masterpiece. Screw piracy, Avengers: Endgame is a movie that deserves to be enjoyed in a theatre, and trust me - it's worth every single penny!"
2348,I don't want to spoil it for those who didn't seen this movie yet!! But this one is best of phase 3 & MCU too!!
2349,"You can't even consider this a film. It's a 3 hour tv episode. Films should work on their own. Even batman returns and the dark knight understood this, and work on their own. This ""film"" is okay enough. The ""original"" score is terrible. The acting is decent. The CGI is way overused, not a single shot without some CG ""enhancements"". The story is, well, near nonexistent once you take out the action sequences. I'd give this a 5/10. Only rated it 1 star because a franchise film does not deserve a spot in the top 100."
2350,"This movie honestly emotionally wrecked me. Yes there was hype but this movie is as good as I expected and more. If you have seen all other MCU films you will most certainly enjoy this one, and altough its runtime is long its story is great. 10/10"
2351,"I saw this movie today in Germany (in the german dubbed version which was as always very good) and of course, this movie was everything and even more we expected.[換行字元][換行字元]It all makes sense. So much subtle moments, so much silence and calm moments, so much breath taking action and releasing humour.[換行字元][換行字元]This is a masterpiece, hands down. In writing, in acting, in directing, in storytelling."
2352,"I enjoyed this film, but at the end, I couldn't help shake the feeling that I found the Infinity Wars a more edgy tense film overall, and we all know how it ended. I'm sure many won't agree, but this is my opinion. I would give Infinity Wars 8.5/10."
2353,Just Awesome....i am a big fan of this movie...iron man is just awesome
2354,"Yeahhh....marvel took everything to make the movie they had promised, the most splendid comic flick I ,and to be honest anyone, has ever seen. First of all do not EVEN think about predicting the following events because from the first 15 mins of the movie you will be completely aware that it is not just another heros-win film.After that , the stoy line was very clear and away of confusion,no illogical-comical dialog or narration, wonderful acting ,and of course the most important one,the well done directing by Russo brothers.The mixture of all of these mad the movie so great that I as a Marvel hater really did enjoyed it."
2355,Just watch it. LOADS OF FUN. Not any kind of masterpiece though. Doesn't come close to the best film of 2019 so far (Us)
2356,It can't get better than this. Best MCU and Marvel movie IMO.
2357,"Over the years Marvel became so big, that for my taste they lost the average viewer by piling on so many characters with their back-stories that someone who just wanted to see a thrilling movie got lost in their universe, so I would say that most of their insider-jokes or comments got lost on non-nerds.[換行字元][換行字元]Unfortunately, like most huge corporations the focus of the Marvel-machine was more to please the mass of escapists than their true fans by utilising a psychological formula which on one hand shows superpowers, but at the same time makes fun of the heroes in order not to loose rationalistic ""non-believers"", plus they spiced it up with sexy heroes.[換行字元][換行字元]Nothing wrong with that, if it would have not been done at the expense of good credible stories or an awe for the heroes - instead now any teen who really admires a superhero will be injected with a pinch of nihilism - enough not to take it all serious anymore in the long run. In other words: by distancing themselves from their heroes in the long run Marvel destroys its own world.[換行字元][換行字元]Compare that to DCs Wonder Woman: Whilst this movie also had really funny moments it drew me so deep into her credible world that I got so emotionally evolved that payed to watch it eight times in the cinema. Infinity War and Endgames in opposition to WW I am not inspired to watch again.[換行字元][換行字元]Knowing that Stan Lee did die in this year and this was going to be his last cameo, even though I didn't like Infinity war, I felt like that this movie would give me the closure not only for the cut of storyline but also for Stan Lee. It did and despite the huge amount of visual effects I found it really easy to let the Marvel Universe go, knowing that there is no valuable content or inspiration in it for me anymore.[換行字元][換行字元]Good bye, Marvel, good bye, Stan Lee. And to all souls who are still young at heart enough to still long to become superheroes in their own right: Excelsior ! (strive to your highest)"
2358,I wish that everyone would get back to making action movies and try not to be so PC. There was more blue steel in this movie than zoolander. Not to mention a million plot holes.
2359,This is the superhero movie we have been waiting for This is Part 2 of Infinity War and it just keeps getting better Not only this movie will be one of the best superhero movies but one of the greatest movies ever I don't have anything else to say about this amazing movie This is a must watch and prepare to be awed by the ending
2360,"One of the best movies of all time. All the elements of surprises, thrills , emotion, comedy, action etc ., is all available in this beautiful 3hour movie, which didn't feel so long as I was so engrossed in this movie. This might be the movie that deserves to be on top of the IMDb charts for top movies of all time surpassing the topper 'the shawshank redemption' ."
2361,It was perfect.best movie I have ever seen.I hope everyone loves it just like me😍😍😍
2362,Its just great. I live it and everything is sooo good
2363,When you bring a character in late and force them and their off screen agenda down our throat it is going to leave a bad taste. Say what you will but this is about the character and its rushed story.[換行字元][換行字元]The powers that be assumed all of us that like Marvel Pictures would slurp up the captain snowflake drivel. It will never happen. All the other actors had had enough too as was obvious during all the junkets.
2364,Just Awesome! Thanks Marvel and everyone involved and Thanks to the Super Heros. Well Done !!!
2365,"Been on IMDB for years, never bothered until today."
2366,"The dumbing down of Hulk and ruining his character by turning him into an utter wimp, turning Thor into a bumbling drunkard, really? Well done Disney on ruining yet another couple of hero's characters (See Luke Skywalker and Yoda in Disney's Last Jedi for extra confirmation of this) That's all I've got to say about this movie."
2367,Made me cry lol I've never cried at any movie or TV show before
2368,"I am not particularly a huge supporter of superhero movies. But I believe that Avengers Endgame was one of the best movies of the year. The plot, the cinematography, character development; it was all there. From beginning to end I was on the edge of my seat and filled with emotion. Good job, Marvel."
2369,Endgame is a movie that makes the audience cry and laugh through the entire three hour long run time. It's laughably bad and sadly disappointing.
2370,"The movie wraps up the series nicely, but as with many finales the movie doesn't really stand in it's own until half way through.[換行字元][換行字元]The first half is wrapping up all that happened before, and a lot has happened to so many different strong and complex characters. The hour and a half it takes to reach the real 'end game' feels both a bit shallow, and slow.[換行字元][換行字元]All in all, the movie does what it promises, end the series, but for those who are not die hard fans, might find the end result a bit uninspired and dutiful."
2371,"Framed in emotions, a farewell to all core charecters. The film strikes through every expectation in terms of storyline, action, visuals and humor. It will give you Goosebumps, it will make you laugh and will emotionally satisfy at the same time. Don't follow these negative reviews...JUST GO AND ENJOY. Its a grand conclusion to 21 epic movies of MCU and things have been placed in the right direction to make it memorable. #Don'tSpoilEndgame"
2372,"There really are no words that anyone can use to describe this film. But if I had to put it into one word, it would be ""Spoilers"". See it if you haven't."
2373,"This movie make me laugh ,clap and cry , make me happy make me sad this one gave every actor a space to really act well specially Hawkeye I don't want to spoil so I just want to say Thanks to every one in cast for giving us this piece of art."
2374,"Okay, these type of movies are not to everyone's taste but if they are then wow are you in for a treat. An amazing movie from start to finish, I'll be seeing it again very soon."
2375,Belive me marvel best movie till date one of the greatest movie in superheros universe
2376,A gripping three hour movie that evades blockbuster action movie tropes. Genuinely funny in a quip-free sort of way.
2377,I saw it in theaters with my kid. We were both laughing and crying on the edge of our seat.
2378,Best movie in an amazing franchise. Perfectly tied together some of the best created characters ever.
2379,"Must see and epic ending, this is the best way how marvel universe end."
2380,The culmination of 10 years in the making paid off big time! Endgame delivers on every emotion you can think
2381,"Terrible ending, I can say terrible, it was scaled down to a funny story rather than a great one, worst avengers movie ever"
2382,"You get heartwarming scenes, love scenes between characters you don't expect that aren't cheesy, character resolutions that you always wanted, and a perfect wrap up to this franchise. I was absolutely blown away. Some may say that the first half of the movie is a little slow, but without it, the movie wouldn't be complete and it shows so much love and heart between every single character."
2383,Problem with time travel is if your not careful you make the whole plot impossible to believe. End game doesn't even come close to tieing up its loose ends. The remaining avengers act selfishly and arragently to the point you want them to fail.[換行字元][換行字元]Thanos did nothing wrong. I hated this film.
2384,"One of the best told superheroes stories and ends well with a bang. However, we are pleasantly surprised with all the twists and turns during the movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Retaliation ? Unexpected heros helps our heroes first...[換行字元][換行字元]Redemption ? Well, if we can turn back time in the past events...[換行字元][換行字元]Sacrifice ? Yes, there is...[換行字元][換行字元]But see the movie. Don't spoil the ENDGAME !"
2385,"I liked the movie Overral a great way to end the phase 3 and infinity stone saga But i dislike some things, like the movie is too long with little action going on in the middle. The ending battle was not epic enough. With a lot going on but nothing truly truly epic And i hated what they did to thor. It was a nice laugh but it was enough Overral a great experience"
2386,"I absolutely love this movie! This film totally blew me away with such a remarkable story! To those not so true believers of marvel who thinks this film is not worth the money and say that it's not the greatest film ever. YOU SUCK! As a filmmaker I really appreciate what the Russo brothers did! Thank you Russo brothers for another great Marvel film! And god bless Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Steve Ditko for creating such remarkable characters that has touched my heart!"
2387,"I cried, i cheered, i laughed, i screamed. I was utterly absorbed by this three hour epic conclusion, by all it's characters and their relationships beetween one another. Groundbreaking."
2388,Really enjoyed this movie. I definitely recommend whether your a marvel fan or just a movie fan.
2389,"What a conclusion! We couldn't ask for more, and it completely exceeded my expectations, on a movie that concluded a story that involved 22 movies. That mission alone was difficult, but the Russo Brothers knew how to work from that and fabricated a movie that besides from concluding the story, it completed the previous chapters! Thrilling, heart breaking, amazing... It lack's words to describe it!"
2390,"Best movie till date , awesome work by marvel cinematic universe"
2391,Better than expected...it's just the best super hero movie ever made..and to me it is one of the best movies ever watched
2392,"This is my first review on IMDb after 10+ years, and I rated a lot. I just HAD to write something. Check my ratings - I very rarely give 10/10. But Avengers: Endgame deserves it. While I am a Marvel fan and have seen all 22 films, I think many of them are merely average and none of them exceptional, maybe except the deep emotional aspects of Black Panther. But Endgame is something else.[換行字元][換行字元]You have to accept that it is a part of a bigger whole - Endgame is only possible because of the 21 movies that came before it. And I think, to really appreciate this film, you need to have seen most of them. If you have only seen Infinity War and maybe 1 or 2 more, you will still experience a world class film full of universally relatable emotional scenes, a great story full of twists, high-stake drama, fantastic humour, nail-biting action and many awesome situations.[換行字元][換行字元]But if you're a Marvel fan... If you have related just a little bit to some of these characters over the years... you are in for the most amazing, superemotional, ecstatic, explosive, overwhelming, hitherto undreamt of film experience you may have in your whole life."
2393,"This movie gets nine and a half stars for anyone seeing all the mainstream Marvel films. It ties everything together so wonderfully. Such clever writing. Only a couple of small problems, clunkers added by Disney to sell their woke version of political correctness, but on every other level, extremely well done."
2394,"This is not sequel of Infinity war. This is the end of all 21 movies. I'm so happy to watch this movie, and all MCU movies from 10 years ago. thank you all."
2395,"If you have such wealth of acting at your disposal but reduce most of your cast to cameo appearances the story suffers. Some of the cameos were great to watch, they are the world's best known actors after all, but to me it was just a bit too much of everything and I lost interest when I lost count of all the characters, plots and subplots. I think I like it better when they focus on one or a few superheroes. High points of the movie: any scene with Tony Stark or Thor, but why use a star like Nathalie Portman when all she has to do is look pretty and walk around a bit, it makes you wonder whether these stars are short on money though. My grandson loved it though."
2396,"I grew up with these movies and invested my time and money on watching every single marvel movie to this date. And boy they didn't disappoint. Such an amazing (bit heartbreaking) farewell to RDJ and Chris Evans. I hope they'll contribute to explore the stories of Natasha, Thor, Bruce and Clint. Love the movie so much and planning to watch it again soon. The last fight was so epic and had so many iconic moments. I am glad that they brought all major characters to this movie. Truly epic. Waiting to see what they will do after the endgame."
2397,Unbelievable. No words. What a great movie and credit to the Russo Brothers for making an amazing film that perfectly encapsulates the 11 years of the franchise.[換行字元][換行字元]Will definitely be going to rewatch this movie
2398,I'm so grateful that in my lifetime I'm able to follow this journey of a epic superhero story. I salute every single one that made this possible from the beginning. It's not easy to keep all the actors working together over a few years to deliver something as big as this. And there isn't a single thing that I don't like about this movie. I won't say more but I believe many of you will be blown away like I was. Go watch it!!
2399,"To be honest, most of the people i talked to about this movie said that endgame was great, fantastic or incredible. None of these people could have answered the question: ""why is this a good movie?"". In the half of the playtime i was bored and already wondering, that they needed another hour and a half to tell the story behind this. I don' t want to spoiler anything and i'll remain quiet until the movie's airing is completed. But once you have seen it, please try to answer this simple question: ""why was this a good movie to you?"""
2400,"What else can I say? This picture is great. If I could, I would give it an 8.5/10, since there are flaws; no film has none, yet is a fun ride with humor, action, chills, and tragedy. Truly, a cinematic experience to remember.[換行字元][換行字元]Yet still, out of Infinty War, Endgame is less in one major way, which is the biggest flaw this film has: Thanos. While a terrifcily written and seemingly unstoppable villian in IW, Thanos in Endgame is...just less. He isn't as fleshed out, especially during the first act, as he was in IW, and he is almost disappointing. In fact, most of the first hour and maybe hour and a half are. While I enjoyed the first couple of hours, could've been better paced and a good ten minutes coulve been edited out. In other words, it was kinda slow.[換行字元][換行字元]As the second act ends, however, it goes from a tender 4 or 5 to a 12. It becomes the climax of not just one film, but 22, 11 years in the making. Without spoling, the final battle is amazing, cahotic and surprisingly violent for a Marvel Film.[換行字元][換行字元]All in all, this is a fantastic ending to a great and quite frankly revolutionary film series, and I guarantee you will at least shed one tear. It has its flaws, which are sadly charecter related, but they don't drag the film through the mud. At a three hour runtime with this many characters, it makes sense that the Russos couldn't do everything perfectly. All in all, this film gets a 85/100.[換行字元][換行字元]TIP: Don't sit through the entirety of credits, for there is no after scene, no thank you to the fans and no tribute to Sir Stan Lee, sadly. So don't waste your time and sit for 10 minutes."
2401,"One of the best superhero movie i have ever seen..Full of emotion..I laughed,i screamed,i cried when I was watching the movie..Never experienced anything like this..This is an epic..End of an era..End of our last 10 years journey.. thank you avengers"
2402,"Quite simply, this is the most overrated film of all time. There was such a great hype about the film and it is rated a strong 8.5. My rating of 1 star is not right and I would give it a 3 or 4, but I feel it had to get 1 to try and level out this scandalous rating it has.[換行字元][換行字元]Frankly the plot is unimaginative and poor and the logic used hapless. It just goes to show that they could produce any film, and as long as it has Iron Man and Co in it, then it will get a good rating."
2403,"For me personally this film was just too darned long. As I sat watching it I suddenly realised against all hope and expectation that I was actually a little bored - a feeling I never got from its predecessor.[換行字元][換行字元]Visually it's stunning (as you'd expect) and I can see how to a great many people it has the ultimate wow factor but for me it doesn't quite hit the spot.[換行字元][換行字元]Personally I'm struggling to put it in my top 3 MCU movies.[換行字元][換行字元]I definitely prefer Infinity War and Guardians Of The Galaxy and then it's a toss up between this, Civil War, The Winter Soldier and Ragnarok."
2404,"Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, Avengers: Endgame does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga. Avengers Endgame is the perfect way to say goodbye to our superheroes. With all the sad moments, it is definitely the best MCU movie."
2405,"First of all i'm still traumatized after watching it 3 days ago and im just gonna say i've never seen anything like this ever not even in marvel cinematic universe. its the greatest marvel and movie experience i have ever had. i loved it 3000 and i love Iron Man 3000. this movie is insane in every possible way and the kind of time travel they used i liked it . I smiled , i laughed , i got sad and then i got very sad and then i finally cried . the one thing that happened is i lost all hope like whats gonna happen in next phases . Im so happy that they made this movie thanks to marvel thanks to stan lee thanks to RDJ and Chris and mark and chris and jeremy and beautiful Scarlett and all actor and actress and kevin . thanks to all marvel family."
2406,Definitely enjoyed this movie. Have been watching marvel movies from the start and would highly recommend you go check it out! 9/10 from me because I wasn't expected the ending to end the way it did....
2407,This is the best worst marvel movie i ever seen so much lag
2408,"Here we are at the end of all things. It's been over a decade with over 20 films leading to this, Avengers: Endgame. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and many, many more Avengers: Endgame hopes to bring the Infinity Saga as it is known now to a satisfying climax.[換行字元][換行字元]It's a lofty goal but if anyone has a chance to pull it off it is Anthony and Joe Russo. These two directors have now become Marvel stalwarts thanks to their impressive skills with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War and the adored Avengers: Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]I can't go any further without stating that there will be spoilers in this review as I have to discuss some aspects of the plot so be wary going ahead. I will also state though I won't bring anything in that is from the third act of Avengers: Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]Plot![換行字元][換行字元]With the opening of Avengers: Endgame we see the team and the world is still reeling from the events of the ""Snapture"". There is however a glimmer of hope with the arrival of Captain Marvel (Larson) and some new leads on Thanos (Brolin). So the gang assemble (as you do for one of these big films) and head out ready to finally make Thanos pay and possibly save the victims of his action.[換行字元][換行字元]Unfortunately, revelations are revealed and everyone is broken even more so than the previous battle. Fast forward 5 years and the world and the universe are vastly different. Our remaining heroes are scattered to the four corners of the universe and people are trying to move on. That is until Ant-Man (Rudd) shows up. Here we are at the end of all things. It's been over a decade with over 20 films leading to this, Avengers: Endgame. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and many, many more Avengers: Endgame hopes to bring the Infinity Saga as it is known now to a satisfying climax. It's a lofty goal but if anyone has a chance to pull it off it is Anthony and Joe Russo. These two directors have now become Marvel stalwarts thanks to their impressive skills with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War and the adored Avengers: Infinity War. I can't go any further without stating that there will be spoilers in this review as I have to discuss some aspects of the plot so be wary going ahead. I will also state though I won't bring anything in that is from the third act of Avengers: Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]What did you do!? Avengers: Endgame is a love letter to fans of both the Marvel comics and the MCU. This means it has all the power of the 21 films behind it. Unfortunately, it also has several of the trappings that have been in each of those films that are amplified by such a major event film. For example, this film is one part a sequel to Avengers: Infinity War but it is also a continuation of Thor's narrative from Thor: Ragnarok. These two elements do not mix as the choices that the Russo brothers make in regard to Thor are laughable and easily could have been handled better. I can see where they are going with how Thor is handling himself after the events of both Ragnarok and Infinity War but they fumble here and Thor is not the only one who suffers. Hulk and Captain Marvel are also mishandled in my opinion. Captain Marvel is a plot device not a character in this film. Reports came out recently that Brie Larson filmed this before her solo outing and it shows in how the Russo brothers utilise her. With regard to the Hulk and Bruce, their whole character narrative is fanservice with no real depth to it. It's a shame because I was looking forward to where Hulk and Bruce were going. On the positive side Captain America (Evans), Iron Man (RDJ) and Black Widow (Johansson) are handled far better. With Cap and Tony, it's again further fan service but with Widow, there is a journey and it's impressive. It's a combination of great acting on Johansson's part and interesting narrative choices. In the end though there are two MVP's in Avengers: Endgame and it's Jeremy Renner and Paul Rudd. Their respective character arcs are emotionally charged and I loved it. They have quiet scenes that bookend the big brawls and it's greatly appreciated. On the topic of the big brawls there is a fair sense of scope and grandeur. The cinematography is decent and there are several moments of awe-inspiring shots that look ripped straight from the comics. They are splash pages in every meaning of the word. Avengers Assemble! There are many moments that fans will cheer over. Moments that will have them in tears clutching their significant other and that is wonderful. I myself cried at multiple points in the film but I am a sucker for these tropes. I can say hand on my heart I will cry at the end of Supernatural when it comes to its conclusion at the end of season 15 but I know that it's not all been award winning. This is the same fact for Avengers: Endgame. There are payoffs to many narrative elements for almost every character across the MCU and some of them are great but there are also payoffs that are just jokes and they clash with the tone of what is supposedly an end of an era. There's even a section in this 3-hour ""epic"" that comes across like a victory lap of sorts. Where the cast seems to be like - Hey remember how great this was? It's unfortunate and it felt like something out of a long-running television series.[換行字元][換行字元]Whatever it takes Avengers: Endgame is a tough film to dissect. In one hand I adored the emotional beats, and several of the character arcs were engaging. However, there are so many issues. The clashing of tones, the misrepresentation of characters from this film as opposed to the last film we saw them in.[換行字元][換行字元]There is no doubt in my mind that Avengers: Endgame is going to make a ton of money that fans will eat it up but it is by no means a perfect film."
2409,"Just perfect, that's it. Perfect movie. From beginning to end it was amazing. The final battle was every childhood dream come true."
2410,Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it
2411,"No Matter How Great The Ending Is, We all Feel Sad About the Ending..! I was a 9 Year Old Kid when it all Started, Became Huge Fan after Avengers 1, and Now when its all ended i want it to start Over..! Overall Summary of the Movie is that , it was everything you want it to be and way above than our Expectations..! I am Eternally Gratefull for this Journey..!❤"
2412,"It was a very long time that i dont cry that much since Titanic. Feel like i was watching 'Empire strikes back' the first time. It so glorious,emotional, epic and so touched. Thank you for bringing the Heroes to our lives. Excelsior!!!"
2413,Unspeakable! everything was perfect. 10 out of 10. Endgame deserve more!
2414,"Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point. In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements... The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on. Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3 hours to find that out."
2415,"Nothing special about this movie, its over rated there was no surprises in the whole film"
2416,"What a movie, Feels like an epic, once a lifetime!"
2417,Outstanding movie just mind blowing... captain America Ironman Thor Hulk...Just Amazing experience....
2418,"One of the best movies I've ever seen , simply EPIC , Enough said"
2419,"Too many cringe worthy moments. Too much talking not enough action. This is superhero movie, not looking for bloodly oscar performance. Time travel thing was silly nonsense. I felt like walking out."
2420,"This movie is best in all Avenger Series.. superb and super excellent..This movie Proof that "" Tony Stark has 💓 Heart..Real Avenger and Real Superhero..Going to miss Iron Man.."
2421,"The movie left me shocked, and astonished. Great movie, Best Marvel movie by a long shot. Wow, just Wow."
2422,"Find superhero. Superhero doesn't want to get involved. Talk to superhero until they do want to get involved. Repeat. Endgame has its moments, but it's way too bloated for its own good."
2423,"As someone who is born in the millennium year, I missed a plethora of chances to watch the so called legendary movies in the history e.g. Shawshank, godfather,..... I thought that there will no longer be any movie that come close to those, however, today in 2019, I watched a movie that contains nearly all vital elements to be called a great movie. Touching, Exciting, Anger, Hilarious. It might not be perfect since there are some plotholes in the movie, but no movie can ever be perfect. For those who said that the first two hours is boring, I felt ambiguous. It is either you have not been watching the other movies in the MCU or you don't understand the movie at all. The first two hours in the movie literally bring myself into the character and all the memories from the previous 11 years was brought back. You felt bored might be because you didnt have the emotional bond in the MCU"
2424,"Not going to spoil anything but if you haven't seen this movie yet, head on down to your local theater and immerse yourself in an experience 11 years and 22 films in the making. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you might pee your pants (seriously go to the bathroom before it starts). What an amazing conclusion to a cinematic universe nearly universally loved. Oh and bring tissues, you're gonna need em ;)"
2425,"My mom is very critical about movies she's not interested in most of them unless if one her favorite so called 'good looking' actors are in the film. ""I really really liked the movie, at first I thought 'oh god when is it gonna end so I can go to sleep' but I loved the movir and it was better than the previous one that you made me watch"" is the exact thing she told me eo as you can see she's not a geeky die hard Avengers fan and we watched it at 1a.m. by the way and she really loves her sleep and the previous movie she was talking about was Infinity War."
2426,As the 22 film in this universe this is probably the most satisfying way it could have been ended. After 2 viewings I can safely say this is one of the greatest superhero films of all time. I was in shock the first time and the second time I was just in awe of how breathtaking the film is. It has you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. I love the character development shown in this film as we complete some of the heroes story arcs as well. It has an absolutely epic scale and has moments you will never forget. The direction this film goes in was completely unexpected right out the gate and I absolutely adored it. There are a few confusing bits but I don't want to get into spoilers.
2427,"Has a lot of plotholes, but I still enjoyed it. However, the rating should be lowered to atleast 7 so im giving it 1 to balance it out, as all things should be."
2428,"Avengers: Endgame is an apotheosis, full of surprises, but I'll tell nothing, the Marvel policy has to be respected: spoilers are prohibited! What I saw was different from my expectations, but good surprises! The Marvel movies are not just films, they are more than that, but I don't figure out the right word. Avengers: Endgame is an epilogue like nothing similar! Go and watch it!"
2429,Perfect from beginning to the end. I wouldn't change anything. One of the best movies i have ever seen. Absolutely stunning.
2430,"There's action, there's emotion, there's drama, there's sci touch. A complete package! What a way to end a decade long legacy."
2431,"Well no words can describe this movie, its more then best. Its amazing. Avoid Spoiler. Avoid spoiler free reviews. I never saw people dancing in cinema hall, people clapping and at last giving standing ovation when the film ends. You miss this movie you miss the world.. 10/10"
2432,Great movie But not better then infinity war. Ending was the best part of it
2433,"You will laugh, you'll cry, you will cheer your heroes and give them standing ovation for their 11 years of hard work and all those movies to make your childhood beautiful...comic relief timing is best and very emotional for such a person like me who is die heart fan of mcu...the journey deserve that end..."
2434,So glad I went to watch this. It hit the spot for me at every turn. Plot was really clever!
2435,"I just saw Endgame today morning and at the end, as the credits rolled, I had a small lump in my throat.

This is not a part 2 of Infinity War. Revenge is a very small topic here and the message sent thru the movie is revenge serves no purpose at the end. It is what we can do to make this better again.[換行字元][換行字元]I don't want to tell any more details because anyone who like me has loved the MCU movies has to see this movie. It is has all the ingredients - action, drama, emotion and comedy.[換行字元][換行字元]The writers also spray in bits and pieces from the past movies and other MCU characters to make it interesting; it is like connecting the dots. I had fun watching those scenes because it is smart writing.[換行字元][換行字元]The acting is outstanding and each actor gives their best shot knowing that this is the grand finale. Special mention goes to Hemsworth, Johannson, Evans and above all the man who started it Downey Jr. They take the movie to another level.[換行字元][換行字元]Finally, is this the best film in MCU? I say No. This movie is a bit too long for its own good at 181 mins. I feel it could have been 15-20 mins shorter. Also, for me, the Iron Man (part 1), Captain America - The Winter Soldier and Civil War, Thor Raganrok and Black Panther are the best films of the MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]However, is this a fitting finale? Yes, it is and a beautiful one. Damm, I am going to miss the Avengers !!"
2436,"This Movie Watch IMAX Better, All Avengers United Save the world, Every Character is important. I like Thor Sledgehammer and AXE, it was cool."
2437,"I can't explain the feeling after I saw it.If I thought that infinity war was amazing, endgame is the grand final. Action, drama, comedy - all come together in one movie. Maybe it took 3 hours, but it's worth it. Marvel surprises me every single time and it's getting better and better. To sum up, that is the best movie I've ever seen. Thank you, Marvel. You made me happy."
2438,"Man, just got out IMAX 3D and I was completely blown away. This was the to bring everything back and make it happen. Love it, love it, love it."
2439,"First I wanna say that i'm not the biggest marvel fan! I like the movies, But they're not the best movies in the world! I think the hype around it is way too much! Anyway, after saying that, it was definitly the best marvel movie till now! I got goosebumps, I almost cried sometimes, I laughed, I screamed. Eventhough i'm not the biggest fan, I still loved it, and Everyone have to see this movie"
2440,Best superhero movie ever i watched in my life. Thanks marvel its great movie.
2441,"A country desperate to sell itself as a hero, together with current propaganda of misplaced feminism and diversity, Avengers is a shallow cliché that won't be enjoyed by anybody 25 years in the future. And yet here we are, selling confusion to adolescents, regardless their age. Tell me if that slap Gamora (female) gives to StarLord (male) would be nearly acceptable if it has been the other way around? Layers of unethical messages and contradictions that go straight to the midbrain. Unfortunate script for many good actors that participated in this super production designed for super degeneration."
2442,"10 years, 22 movies has come to an end.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie provides laughter tears and joy. It is the perfect ending for most of the characters and a New beginning for Some.

2443,Love it. Everything about it is amazing movie of the year
2444,"If you write a bad review about this movie you haven't seen all the other marvel movies you may have just seen infinity war and endgame you have no understanding of the super hero's how there Character have developed through the own films how the films interlinked , how true fans can watch mcu films again and again and love every second How just the theme music to the Avender moves send shivers down your spin true fans no this , not random people who pass judgment after only seeing 2 films you need to see THE HOLE PICTURE not just one corner"
2445,All over the place & all in all very dissapointing - even some of marvel characters have morphed into embarrassing caricatures. Is it the writers fault or have some of the actors got a bit too much influence? ..... I don't get what planet anyone who gives thos film 5/10 is living on let alone all the 9/10 and 10/10 rating ... The mind boggles ....
2446,Always been a fan of Super hero movies. This made me laugh and cry. Absolutely loved it.
2447,"Honestly, i never see a superheroes movie like this before. All emotion, All hypes. With this and Spiderman, phase 3 will be over with a new fresh phase."
2448,You didn't saw that coming. If you don't leave the theater crying there is something really wrong with you
2449,"Now i might be from the minority, but the first couple of hours of this movie were not that great. However, the last hour was just a mix of amazing and amazinnger"

2451,I can't think of a movie that covers the scope of End Game.
2452,I thought the whole plot of the movie was gonna be different but once I saw the movie it completely just blew my mind. MARVEL CAN NOT MAKE A BETTER MOVIE THEN ENDGAME. They just can't. Endgame will always be Thea best. 10/10
2453,"This movie is the complete package of comedy, action and emotions too.This movie will exceed your expectations.Thank you Marvel. #Loveyouironman3000"
2454,Simply is the greatest super hero movie there is. I really don't want to get into the movie to avoid spoiler's
2455,"I do enjoy the ending but I am quite disappointed with Endgame's whole execution.[換行字元][換行字元]It felt like a slap stick comedy rather than the dark Avengers movie it was supposed to be. I don't mind jokes here and there, like in Infinity War, but it was a lot of it, even til the point that I found it disturbing.[換行字元][換行字元]Thor and Thanos was quite redeemed in IW but their portrayals here feels like a slap in the face. Are MCU even aware that Thanos was so well written that he has a fanbase?[換行字元][換行字元]This isn't a worthy ending for Phase 3 and MCU as we know it. It was just OK."
2456,"Eventually people will start rating it down, saying that it doesn't deserve the place above inception or the dark knight, but should they really do that? Rate the movie according to it's worth, and not bcz it surpassed your fav movie. Don't lick a** of your all time fav, this movie deserves every damn applause!"
2457,This is the world's best ever tribute as an epic conclusion to the world's best superhero franchise. Thank you Stan-lee and thank you MCU we love you
2458,"It's funny it's a great movie with great reviews and is highly successful, overall. But, the trolls are coming out to play on imdb today, boy. It tied up previous loose ends from past films, it had a good story that was inventive, fun and clever. It had many easter eggs tied to past films and movies and is a great superhero film and a good film, period.[換行字元][換行字元]9.4/10"
2459,No idea where what everyone else watched but this movie was bad. A million questions unanswered and the solutions used were the worst. Not going to spoil but you'll see.
2460,Never really do reviews but this film was one of a kind. The way 21 films and 11 years of the MCU lead up to 3 hours of an emotional rollercoaster was just amazing.[換行字元][換行字元]I personally feel this that each individual will have their own reaction to this film as each person will have connected to a character in their own way and to a certain degree.[換行字元][換行字元]It will be a saga that will last an infinity....
2461,"That 3 hours just flew by too fast! Never have I been in a movie as packed as this theater was and as lively as the crowd was. There was cheering several times during the movie and crying from some at certain times, gasping and shouting lol! This moviehad it all including almost every person ever involved in a Marvel movie (except Coulsen) but I'm binging Agents of Shield with my GF right now so we'll get our Coulsen fix later lol! Sad to say goodbye to many years of Marvel movies but excited for phase 4!"

2463,"What a waste of time. I am so sorry for all the Thor & Hulk fans. I really am. Movie makers played everyone for fools with all the hype. Lord of the Rings and Avatar remains my all time favorite. My advice to all those who havent watched the movie yet, please do yourself a favor and wait for the DVD. It is highly likely that you will feel wasted like me, so at least you will have saved the money."
2464,"Avengers: Endgame is the biggest superhero movie of all time. It is an incredible event of MCU and magnificent ending of Infinity Saga. Marvel has been doing great movies during years, as a fan I followed and watched all of them with interest. But this one, just blowed my mind. I remember my hands were shaking at final fight. No doubt, Captain America's line ""Avengers, Assemble!"" has become the most epic line in MCU and this film has become the most epic movie in MCU. Except few things, everything is clear on my mind about Endgame and it truly satisfied me. I don't want to talk so much about each character and each scene because I don't want to give any spoilers. So I just want to thank all cast, Kevin Feige, Russo Brothers, Christoper Markus and Stephen McFeely, all directors and writers in MCU films but the most importantly I want to say that Im so grateful to Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko. Thank you 3000. Thank you Marvel Studios for showing us such great stuff.[換行字元][換行字元]Part of journey is the end."
2465,I surprised I laughed I cried a comlete journey of 10 years
2466,"Wraps up about 10 years of movies spectacularly. Great character development, humor, and just enough fan service. People will say the first 2 hrs were slow, but I had no issues with it. Watched it 5x in packed theaters and they are once in a lifetime experience to cheer for these heroes in a crowd."
2467,"This movie is amazing. Not only does it have breathtaking moments, but it is also fun. The only flaw I see is that it has a slow start. Other than that, it's incredible."
2468,"Amazing way to wrap 11 years into one movie. Everyone did a great job.Thanks Directors,CAST members for this wonderful life journey we have experienced.#WhateverItTAKES"
2469,"The film was very beautiful. It combines drama, action and comedy. It was a very nice mix so far. It is certainly the best film of MCU films and also the best film I have seen so far this year."
2470,"Infinity War is just too big of a movie to overcome & Endgame suffers from trying to do it. The pacing was bad. Some characters are misrepresented & their arcs are ruined by doing so. Somehow this movie can't handle the amount of characters in it, but it's predecessor do it really great. Disappointing."
2471,"It's easy to say, but this is the end of a decade. With Avengers: Endgame we come to the end of an era. I'm not just talking about the 21 movies that we've passionately watched in the last 11 years, but, beyond that. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is perhaps the largest and most complex builder of multimedia universes that has ever existed.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame, in many ways, functions as a reunion: of the characters, of the multiple stories, of the scenarios, cities and planets, and of the diverse epochs covered by the MCU. I dare say that Infinity War is a roller coaster ride, Endgame is more of a chess game where each move brings us to a definitive end.[換行字元][換行字元]I laughed , cried and was speechless. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies. The writers outdid themselves on this one. I just hope the next ten years can live up to the first."
2472,"Having been an ardent fan of the avengers series and especially been awed by the brilliance and creativity of how Marvel managed to juxtapose the many superhero universes and crafted it cleverly to meet in the same time and space.. I was sadly disappointed by the lack of a supernova ending to culminate this epic journey. What you get instead Is the conflict within yourself wherein your mind, which is hardwired to like this movie, Is being challenged by your heart which starts to realise that you wanted more .. way more.[換行字元][換行字元]The plot was consumed by a complex theory of time travel which seemed forced and not to mention it took most of the prime time. The remainder was more focused on the characters making peace with their past rather than the end game itself. If anything at all the actual end game is probably 45 mins long. And the plethora of superheroes in the plot made it too crowded and at times forced- especially towards the end. Out of the many superheroes whose presence you question or their portrayal.. the most notable fall from grace was Thanos himself whose part was just academic. After his epic performance and build up in the last series this was a damp squib at its very best. If you were expecting the likes of an epic battle where an immovable force meets an unstoppable object.. where you root for the good guys but respect the bad one? This ends with a complete digression and confusion and starts too late and gets over too soon.[換行字元][換行字元]Go for it only because you are now committed.. but save money on the pop corn!"
2473,Staggering.....Electrifying....Suberbly-Satisfying....True culmination of 22 movies....Can't be better....Do watch this hotshot epic .....🔥🔥🔥👌👌👌❤❤❤
2474,The best movie i have ever seen I advise everyone to watch it I'm so sad because the series was ended but it is the best end ever
2475,"Avengers Endgame is us. It's the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe bundled up in the most amazing, perfect fashion that is mind-blowing in every sense of the word. It's totally different from the other films with a brilliant origin and end for every character arc throughout the respective MCU phases. It's the ultimate fan service. Props to Jon Favreau for doing an remarkable job by creating Iron Man in 2008 and opening the door for this stream of magnificent movies to be made and no appreciation will be enough for the Russo brothers who have smoked this one out of the park. A double home run. A 10/10. IT IS THE EPIC."
2476,"What a film, start to finish couldnt stop watching"
2477,Paltrow and Downey are the two most insipid actors on the planet. No matter the role they play it the same. Banal. Wooden. Worthless. Arrogant. Boring. I can only imagine how much better the films they disgraced would have been with real talent.
2478,I just didn't enjoy this as much as infinity war but not a huge marvel fan. Not sure why this is getting so much hype.
2479,"I laughed I cried, I shouted at one point. I had my head in my hands. I had my hands in the air. I went back to the box office and booked again.[換行字元][換行字元]One word...... special.[換行字元][換行字元]See it to believe it, a masterclass in film making. And the perfect close to a decade of entertainment and a year of obsession and theorizing (and STILL being off the Mark.)"
2480,"The first 2 hours weren't great. Overall enjoyed it, the ending was satisfying enough. Saw it by myself, the wife wants to go, but I'm not anxious to see it again in theaters. Infinity war was much better in my opinion."
2481,"Absolutely amazing action, humor, drama and emotion. The film definitely lived up to the hype which I wasn't expecting. Also the CGI was brilliant and story was good. The music aswell was very good and some of the silences really brought the emotion. Finally, I just thought the end of the film was unbelievably epic and would go watch it again tomorrow just for the end."
2482,The Film moved a bit slow for most of the movie but the ending was great. Infinity Wars was much better in my opinion. I also felt that the ending climatic sequences could've been bigger and more involved. Several people weren't even shown in the most important climatic moments.
2483,"A collection of movies that span over a decade has truly come to an end! and what a finale that was! an emotional roller coaster to say the least, it's just exquisite"
2484,No spoilers except expect to cry at some point. Can't believe this phase is over. I love these movies.
2485,"Most awaited movie of this decade is here today & YES I saw it the very first show of it & right now I am speechless. Russo Brothers has nailed it. Its not a movie its an emotion for all the Marvel Fans who waited exactly for a year to know what will happen after Infinity War & now we just got this.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is a must watch & may be watched again & again for true fans.

2488,"This will probably be one of the shortest reviews I've ever written because I do not want to #SpoilTheEndgame for those who haven't seen it. So this review is more of an explanation of how I felt after walking out of the theater and there is no way to adequately describe the sort of visceral impact that this movie will have on audiences across the world.[換行字元][換行字元]THIS WAS A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE UNLIKE ANY OTHER! THANK-YOU MARVEL STUDIOS![換行字元][換行字元]When a franchise takes you on a 22-film journey, over 11-years, it's safe to say there's a lot on the line for the filmmakers to deliver. I can't imagine the pressure the filmmakers felt with making this film. I felt unease going into Avenger's Endgame prior to the initial first reactions that were posted online. When I saw the glowing praise this film received, I was relieved, but that still didn't prepare me for the experience.[換行字元][換行字元]You know a movie like this is going to deliver on the big moments. Huge set pieces are what Marvel Studios excels at. But you don't know just how well it's going to come together as a whole. My God, this film does it better than anything you've ever seen. If Infinity War was the movie that tore audiences down, Avengers Endgame is the therapy and revival that we all needed.[換行字元][換行字元]This is a testament to the strength of great character building and storytelling. This film is a tribute to all the year's fans spent going on this journey. This film truly is a culmination of every ""phase"" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Avenger's Endgame just proved that the world needs heroes. This is without question, the greatest superhero movie of all time, and arguably one of the best cinematic experiences ever. 10-stars!"
2489,"Well what can I say! I was late to the party with this final instalment on the Avengers franchise. Over the years I've look forward like a school kid waiting for the next film to come out,bland waiting to see what happens next. This didn't disappoint. I'm sure if and when I watch this film again I will see glimpses into other characters and films I haven't thought about it didn't realise as that seems to be the norm now. As ever a cheeky cameo from the creator to add a bit of humour to a sometimes very dark and serious film. Although that's the Avengers all wrapped up I feel there will be something else to takes it's place just around the corner."
2490,"Marvel lost me in a suicide mission. The ending sucked big time, they ruined the hero's that made the marvel universe what it is. Plot sucked, execution was boring, ending horrifying, And for no reason!!! That's it no more marvel for me. I AM DONE WITH THIS NONESENSE TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED."
2491,Expectations always comes with a slightly disappointment
2492,It was bittersweet and a bit nostalgic. Kudos to everyone. I wouldnt have it any other way. #DontSpoilTheEndgame
2493,"There is spectacle, although like a lot of massive CGI battles, you can't figure out what the hell is going on (Frankly, Hawkeye's sword fight with another human might have been the most coherent fight). There are SOME tender moments that work (and others that don't). There were lots of funny moments, usually provided by Thor.[換行字元][換行字元]All in all, a capable action flick. But, it could have been so much more, if they'd gone full nerd. Why do I say that? Because nerds would have got ""power"" situation right. The heroes powers fluctuate so greatly between movies, and even within the movie that it could drive a purist mad. There is nothing wrong with fantasy movies (e.g. sci-fi, space, Hobbit, etc.), but the worlds need to be internally consistent to be fun. Also, the ""cavalry charge"" at the end of all these movies is getting tiresome. (But, I get the ""nick of time"" stuff generically pumps up the ""dramatic tension.""...a little)[換行字元][換行字元]Anyway, it isn't top 10 of the MCU, but it's probably top 15. I'd still probably see Deadpool over and over again, rather than continue to see these middling, mass produced, corporate exercises. Like Star Wars the early years with Lucas instead of Disney. These corporate movies will never endanger the golden goose, or do anything surprising."
2494,This was amazing don't think they'll make a film like this ever again I cried laughed all the way Avengers........ Assemble 🤙
2495,"Arriving at the end of a series of over 20 related movies, THIS was an event! What can I say about this? During my showing, there was laughter, there were tears, and there were most certainly cheers. I saw it in IMAX 3D and felt it was more than worth the ticket price. It is (almost) difficult to rate the movie on its own merit since it is in no way a standalone film. That being said, the cinematography, acting, music deserved a 10/10. There are wonderful references and throw backs for fans. ""Epic"" is not an exaggeration in describing the scope here. If you enjoyed ANY of the previous movies, you will enjoy this one.[換行字元][換行字元]Side note: use the restroom before going and don't order a large drink. The 3 hr. run time is no joke (and you don't want to miss a minute)!"
2496,"It was really hurtful for me...Since a kid they were my childhood heroes..And now you guys end it like my all emotion multiplying 3000 times..... The perfect end of 22 movies....Great Story.. those sacrificed are really emotional for me....Always gonna be my favourite best movie.....I Love you MCU,Stan Lee And IronMan,Thor,Captain 3000 times...."
2497,Not sure any words do this film justice it is that great. Marvel we love you 3000
2498,"Just after watching the movie I wanted to write a bad review comparing this with another creatures of cinematography from different genres which I personaly prefer more, but then I thought - why should I be so biased to a certain category of movies, revised everything and understood that this picture is oustandingly well. First, it logically continues where we left in the previous part, from which that movie is significantly different - overall mood seems to shift from seriousness and in some degree of sadness to more bright and hilarious composition. Plot is not completely straightforward and persuades a viewer to continue watching. The really bad thing is that there were some moments which in case of applying a deep inspecting seems to be silly, but, one the other hand, it could be understood as providing a simplificated view on the story, something balancing between nice-captured one without a plot and one having a plot but without any beautiful scenes. Surely, there are lots of computer graphics, but, though, there are too many realistic battle scenes as for me, and even as I can't say that image lacks beautiful scenes, I would increase quantity of colorful episodes. As a result - the movie worth watching definetely, but make sure that you watched at least the previous movie - then you'll get much bigger outcome since these two strongly connected in the logical sense and tell a single story."

2501,An excellent movie in all respects.[換行字元][換行字元]Some DC fans are on IMDB giving it 1 or 2 stars - they are easy to spot and ignore.
2502,"I want to give it 7/10 but +1 just for the potential of film makers who could present this conclusion.[換行字元][換行字元]IW was just too perfect. Endgame must have been on the top of it, but sadly it is not.[換行字元][換行字元]Despite of the difficulty to continue with the storyline after thanos' snap, this end is satisfactory.[換行字元][換行字元]I think film makers should have taken one more part of Avengers to bring down the conclusion. This way they could bring more action to it."
2503,I love it the bast avengers movie of all the times
2504,"Nearly perfect in every way, Endgame justifies it's 3 hour run time with incredible character moments, epic scenes, and satisfying character write offs. The perfect extension of Infinity War...A five a half hour epic between the two films that I believe many will go back and watch time and time again. The only flaw I had was a bit of a slow pace in the beginning and some jokes that didn't land. Will Definitely be seeing multiple times!"
2505,The best and most bittersweet ending to a franchise I have ever seen. Thank you for the memories.
2506,"New avengers movie is kinda good and it's worth watching for one time. I had this feeling that thanos had screwed avengers so hard in the past movie that the writers had to use one of the oldest cliches in the history of cinema, time travel. The movie is an absolute failure in scripts and you can also find some oldschool cliches in that too, like the way that all the heros are walking in slow motion and someone is narrating ""we're the avengers"". I think the only reason this movie is so popular is the commercials that were going on for a year before this movie was screened. I liked the infinity war better at least it had some new things to say."

That said, it's a great wrap to a great franchise; far more coherent than the DCEU anyway but simply not solid as LOTR.[換行字元][換行字元]It's a feel good movie, which at points seems like advertisment for other movies of the last decade. Yet because they have generally done well, it's a nice journey and deserved endorsement for the studio."
2509,"Every good thing always comes to the end. So it is true for the Avengers as well. The journey of original 6 Avengers is finally come to the end. Ever since Marvel president Kevin Feige has announced about two Avengers movie in 2017, fans were excited to see the grand saga. Marvel has delivered a masterpiece. Endgame in any manner is the movie which will be remembered for generations to come. It will be remembered for its epic scale and storytelling which has never been done before. Directors and writers painstakingly portrait the entire journey of all 22 Marvel movies. Almost all the aspects, reference of previous movies are included in this epic saga. After the events of Infinity war fans were curious about the next move of our mightiest heroes. Also fans were skeptical about the role of Captain Marvel. But thankfully Russo brothers have managed her presence really well without taking the limelight from original 6. Movie is revolved around original Avengers and how they will reverse the effect of Thanos' snap. How other living super heroes will help in this journey. What will be the fate of our heroes, whether Thanos will be killed or not. All these questions are answered in this movie.There are various scenes in the movie which will make you laugh, emotional, energetic and what not. It has presented the emotional side of our super heroes which really touches our hearts. Time travel is the most fascinating part of the movie which travels through past events which reminds us the journey of MCU. You will enjoy lot many parts of the movie such as cameos of various characters, some un-resolved threads, new timeline, and final battle. Honestly last 30 to 40 minutes is the best part of the movie specially the final battle scene. I will not spoil the detail of that scene but honestly you will definitely stand from your seat. I myself stood 3 to 4 times during this battle scene. And in final scene of battle I literally cried in the theatre. This scene will surely touch the hearts of all loyal fans. And finally my final comment. Marvel has given a masterpiece to its loyal fan base. Fans who are grown up during this journey, fans who have lived with this characters. And these fans will always remain loyal to Marvel. Lots of love to Original 6. Robert Downey Jr. -(Tony Stark / Iron Man), Chris Evans- (Steve Rogers/Captain America), Chris Hemsworth- (Thor), Mark Ruffalo -(Bruce Banner/Hulk), Scarlett Johansson- (NatashaRomanoff/Black Widow), and Jeremy Renner- (Clint Barton/Hawkeye). Rating - 10/10"
2510,"Man this gotta be the best one, it wasn't how i thought it was gonna be but it was still dope......."
2511,"Good movie and thats all.. Before I saw the movie, I heard nothing but how great the movie was. all the reviewers were so high that i thought it was the best movie in history. but actually the film was good enough and no more. It was too much hype. It was more of a drama movie than an action movie. All the other MCU movies that have been before this one are better than this one, hands down"
2512,"You won't need a bachelor's degree in Marvel to see this movie, but some background information will definitely help, as the character gallery is gigantic. Arguably Black Panther, Thor, Doctor Strange and Infinity War are the most important to see.[換行字元][換行字元]Props for good acting, cool effects, and great pacing. The 3 hours of the movie went surprisingly fast.[換行字元][換行字元]As always the characters are invincible and can seemingly survive anything. That holds for those without superpowers as well. And, as you know they all have somewhat cringey humour, thus my deduction of two stars. Plot holes are also apparent. Though, I'll give the creators huge props for actually managing to stitch together a movie of these proportions in a somewhat coherent manner. The ending battle is also nothing short of epic."
2513,"Loved it! Made me tear up many, many times. The cast did amazing!"
2514,"This is definitely the pinnacle of Marvel's years of story building, so epic, so mesmerizing, so perfect. I couldn't imagine any superhero movie could be any greater than this, at least not in the foreseeable future. I don't think anybody should miss this movie. Watch it while it's still playing on theatres. This could be the greatest movie of this decade, or even any decade for that matter."
2515,Avengers Endgame has no words after watching the movie. Spectacular indeed. Each and every frame is worth to see it with out eye flipping. An World wide Boxoffice record creater. Jut it is memorable experience and living in Heart long lost after watching this movie.
2516,"The movie kept me excited and entertained for the whole 3 hours. There was not a moment of me taking my focus of the movie, and that's what good movies do."
2517,"A movie that gives Marvels Fans a memorable conclusion to a story told in such a long period of time and across the universe. Definitely worth watching again, just too catch every single detail."
2518,"This is such an epic movie! You will get everything in this movie. Fun, emotion, love, what is not in the move! This is such a great ending! I just love this movie and cried when watching this..."
2519,"All jealous Marvel critics can suck it, this is the most expensive and the biggest movie of all time.Period."
2520,"I'm so touching in the last battlefield,Avengers Assemble!"
2521,Yes the movie is long but every second is enjoyable and memorable. I checked the time once throughout the entire movie just past the two hour mark but then it immediately throws you back in.
2522,"This is my favorite movie of all time. I it love, i watched it 3 times in the cinema. Best movie ever."
2523,Since we started watching Iron man when we were teens up until now 11 years and 22 movies all those came to success for this movie Endgame. If it is not like this there can't be any other better ending.[換行字元][換行字元]All of the hard work was worth it. And RDJ you made us marvel fans and you made the mcu what it is today.
2524,Infinity War would have been a more fitting end to the series. Endgame feels like it jumped the shark and stole all your money doing it. While the actors are perfect for their roles as you would expect the script and story and directors are out of their mind and can't agree on how anything works. This could have been trimmed to 2 hours with little lost. I would have been less disappointed had I seen Batman V Superman by mistake.
2525,"I would remove one star for the attempt of political correctness. I'm not saying the female scene is bad, but the storyline around captain marvel is lowsy and could be better.[換行字元][換行字元]Other than that, no complains at all. Very good actors, thanks for your hard work! You deserve every dollar you get from this movie!"
2526,"First off, I'll just say that you should put aside any fears that its three-hour run-time might be down to a lack of pace, for 'Avengers: Endgame (2019)' moves exactly as it needs to and it really does fly by. It's not too fast-paced, though, as it takes the time to make sure its events have an impact, which is greatly appreciated. The story, which is shrouded in secrecy and - on my part - shall remain so, is actually quite bold. It never feels like it's under any pressure to move in a specific direction, constantly evolving in natural and, even, somewhat surprising ways. It may take a few small leaps in logic, and generally require a bit more suspension of disbelief than is usual with this sort of stuff, but it never breaks its own rules. Every decision the filmmakers make is for the benefit of the narrative, even those which gloss over - and, thus, retrospectively highlight - some of its (admittedly fastidious) unanswered questions. None of these possible, and only very slight, 'plot holes' even matter, though, primarily because the affair is so much fun. It also takes a lot of risks, being as far away from 'cookie-cutter' as it can. While it may lean towards some elements that long-time fans of the overall franchise might have seen coming, it always presents things in fairly unique, unexpected ways and consistently puts importance on character above all else. This is, as usual, what really makes the feature work. Even when things are at their biggest (and, trust me, they get big), you're never far from a smaller, often more satisfying character-revealing moment. The major characters here are more well-rounded than in 'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)', despite the fact that there's almost as many. This includes, thankfully, Captain America himself, who was somewhat sidelined last time; in fact, he's perhaps the main player this time, alongside Iron Man. Some characterisations are also unanticipated and will almost certainly be polarising, but they're certainly appreciated - even if only for the risk. The antagonist is a little weaker this time as he's a bit more traditionally 'bad guy', but he's built on a more-than-solid foundation and is as imposing as ever. Marvel have made no qualms in calling this the end of an era - the so-called 'infinity saga', to be more specific - and it really does feel like a culmination of this (over) ten-year journey, especially in terms of the 'main' Avengers. It's certainly a film for the fans and it isn't squeamish about it. It's incredibly satisfying, to say the least. It's also incredibly moving in a number of key scenes. You'll experience pretty much every emotion a movie can give you. The whole thing is slightly strange, helped immensely by knowing very little before going in. It's almost difficult to describe, in a way, but its effect is actually quite profound. I suppose it takes a while to 'come to terms' with. I don't think I've fully formed my opinion on it just yet. Don't get me wrong, though. It's great. It's more than great. It's a new kind of cinematic event, the kind of story only possible with a twenty-one movie backlog of character histories and audience investment. The more I think about it, the more I like it. The visuals are stunning, the CG is seamless, the action is spectacular, the characters are superb, the scale is staggering, the scope is substantial, the stakes are serious and the story is simply splendid. It really is something. 9/10"
2527,"Endgame does a fantastic job at wrapping up what the MCU has been building towards for the past 11 years. The conclusion was satisfying bundled up with great action scenes and amazing character moments. Not many people enjoyed the first act of the movie, but I actually did because I felt that the build up for the events that come later on in the film was necessary. I think it does a great job at showing how people are (trying) to cope with half of life in the universe turned to dust. Any MCU fan needs to watch this film to watch how all 22 films become tied together in this amazing cinematic event finale!"
2528,"Could have done lot better It was a movie of hulk , cap and iron man talking a loooooooooot and just talking"
2529,My only pain would be that Captain Marvel never got to show her true incridible power right in this movie or at least we didn't see too much of it....other than that overall Amazing movie!
2530,The best movies till now. common how many worlds I have to write?
2531,"Has everything an amazing movie should; action, emotion, romance, comedy, and it just put all the marvel movies together to end it all in a beautiful way. It is every superhero fans dream"
2532,"It is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. Every character gets the same quantity of attention. It was a beautiful way to end the Avengers series (I think this is the last Avengers movie, but hope that it isn't). C'MON GUYS LETS GIVE THIS MOVIE A 10/10 RATING!!"
2533,"Action-packed, emotional and mind blowing. Avengers: Endgame is easily Marvel Studios' crowning achievement. The amount of action may not be a lot like what we see in Infinity War but what makes it still worth a watch is how do characters are built and how we got so invested into those characters. By ""not a lot of action"", I mean, there's only a few but it was epic! The story may be quite messy when it comes to the topic of Time Travel but it was still worth a watch. The visuals, as always, amazing. The crew did a great job at balancing the action, humor and drama. Special thanks to the directors, Anthony and Joe Russo and screenwriters, Christoper Markus and Stephen McFeely. Another thing, Robert Downey Jr. is the mostly the heart of the movie. Conclusion, The Perfect Conclusion to the Infinity Saga."
2534,"Lot of hype, less of good content. Film is not bad, but still is disappointing in many areas. I have expected epic adventure movie with comic characters, and I've got summer family action flick with good humor, mediocre sound and 8/10 effects. Wasn't a waste of money, but doesn't live up to its hype."
2535,No Negative reviews.. This is one of my most favourite movies of 2019
2536,This movies is the greatest superhero movie to ever be created. Robert Downey jr. portray Iron man I couldn't see anyone else playing as iron man. This movie is very sad because it's an end of an error this has been a 11 year in to the making of this movie. I would suggest to watching this movie there a great story and excellent finishing
2537,Unfortunately its wasn't that much good[換行字元][換行字元]The characters not taken the same space as infinity war where we seen all of them with there true power
2538,"I wish there was any way to give more than 10 stars to this movie. One of the finest movie of the year. A perfect movie, perfect from all point of view, may it be story, direction, vfx, action , comedy, emotions that keep you spell bound and engaged through out the movie. Absolutely brilliant and stunning works from all departments - crisp story, amazing acting and nice direction. Through out the movie emotions will run high and low and will keep you lively and you feel those characters without any predictable twist and turns. In this movie entertainment is guaranteed for sure. Films has lots to offer. (Some scenes are so emotional that even some adults next to me cried/choked.) And can be watched several times. Totally worth the hype, money and time you spend on it. Please plan to watch on a as big screen as possible for the best experience. Movies like this are treat to eyes."
2539,"I will try to not reveal anything about this movie because everything new will amaze you. It takes you well back in time and references other movies that just fit in perfectly. It gives shock and seeing all the characters on screen felt the wait worthwhile. Although this title did had some confusions from previous references, it still worked out. This is a must-see movie and I hope it will be enjoyable for everyone else as well."
2540,Exceeds everybody's expectations and easily the best movie I've seen till date.
2541,"Despite the one forced second of the SJW, Cheese Larson, this was such a good movie to the round off this phase in the MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you for not making it about Karen Danvers and being loyal to the fan base."
2542,Overall average movie still infinity war is the best..they ruined some of the mcu characters such as Thor and Hulk. In the last 21 films we knows that how strong is thor bt in the endgame thor was a in a comic role only they ruined the character.emotional weight of the story is rly praise worthy cinematography and visuals are marvelous.like the matter of thor plenty of mistakes is there in the film. Overall average film
2543,"Amazing, poignant, huge and beautiful. Nothing more to say other than this film delivers and is the perfect end to this run of films!"
2544,3 hours of enjoying 4DX was the best choice to watch this movie
2545,I have been waiting for this for a long time and it was a great ending
2546,Thank you MCU. Best movie ever. It is amazing how the story was scripted and death in movies is always nice to see. They keep it human and not sort of fake things.
2547,"Up there with the best film I've seen, perfectly ended an 11 year journey, blown away."
2548,The idea of the film is there. What killed the movie overall was the writing and the poor choices made by the director. I get that they wanted to pander to the younger kids that were 12 or younger but went to ridiculous lengths to do so that killed any reason for anyone over the age of 30 to like it beyond being happy that their children liked it.
2549,Best movie ever and deserves a award. Can't wait for the next one
2550,"This movie offers many compelling moments - whether fun, breathtaking, tear-jerking, or thought-provoking. Yet it doesn't offer a strong narrative that pulls them together into one coherent movie. The first and second acts are wildly disharmonious with each other, and while the confrontation of the third act is satisfyingly epic, it doesn't quite erase the fact that the key in the lock of the conflict's solution still feels a bit like cheating, even though the writers have tried to make it airtight. This is a movie about nostalgia more than anything, and thus offers many sentimental nods to fans. If you're a fan who's more into sentiment than narrative, then you'll probably find this movie quite satisfying. However, after the masterful satisfying. However, after the masterful ""inevitability"" of its prequel's storyline, the somewhat chaotic and random tone of this movie's narrative feels like a letdown to me."
2551,A fantastic climax to the MCU. Hard to post a review without spoilers my
2552,"Just came from a midnight screening , what a movie ! It will leave with every emotion ! Thank you MCU for this franchise !"
2553,THIS IS THE BEST FINAL MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! AINT NOBODY IS READY FOR SUCH MOVIE!!
2554,A fantastic film making me laugh and then bawl my eyes out from both happiness and sadness. Possibly the best 3 hours of my life and I'm (although sad about some) overjoyed about the endings for all of the characters. This is what the MCU has built up to. Well done Russo Brothers!
2555,"Just incredible. In ten years time I'm almost certain that I'll still remember my first viewing. The reaction of the audience genuinely said it all: laughing, gasping, shaking, crying. I was in complete awe. An amazing ending to an amazing saga."
2556,"My expectations are not above the infinity war, but movie was sucks in many ways, first storytelling was complex, if rat didn't enter microbus, movie wouldn't exist, directors ruined thor(fathor), also we didn't see hulk and black widow's fighting scene, strange played water, thanos became classic villain after infinity war, he was extremely nerfed too, there was only two emotional scenes, last fight was garbage, it's like directors told all performers '' let's join the fight scene concurrently '' fight scene was same with Aquaman movie, only war in Aquaman happened in water"
2557,An amazing movies with in my eyes practically no faults. Incredible!
2558,Infinity war still better. Too many holes to go over. I love the MCU but this missed the mark in my opinion. I would watch infinity war over this hands down.
2559,Oh dear god! What was this PC crap? Ruined the movie. Iron man deserved better. Shame on you.
2560,"I think what going on with the high score and usually it settles down a little bit lower as time goes on. But I think we're seeing what happen when the dark Knight came out. A ton of people were voting perfect or near perfect scores for the dark Knight so it could overtake the godfather.when they hadn't even seen it I think that's what's going on here yesterday there wasn't even 1000 votes at 11:30 Eastern time there's almost 11,000 votes what I mean votes are from 1 to 10 stars. I thought IMDB fix this problem but apparently not now the average matrix score is 78 that's what they should really go by now course on the worst site ever rotten tomatoes is that a 97 but the most important part is that almost 8.3 is the average score of the people they gave it a fresh review. Rotten tomato will take anybody that will review they don't care if you're a real film critic or not"
2561,Lets be honest... Avengers Infinity War was 1000x better than Endgame.
2562,"The Russo brothers' poignant, powerful finale more than lives up to the hype: It's a thrilling conclusion and a deeply emotional exploration of loss and love, duty and honor, friendship and family."
2563,"Go ahead and watch the trailers for Avengers: Endgame, they won't give anything major away. It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible.[換行字元][換行字元]Ant-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things.[換行字元][換行字元]The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films.[換行字元][換行字元]If Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones.[換行字元][換行字元]What we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on.[換行字元][換行字元]Is Avengers: Endgame OK for children? If your child has seen any MCU film then they'll be OK with this. The film has fair number of bad words, but the violence is on par with what younger fans are accustomed to. For example, there isn't any one instance that's as graphic as when the monster ate the businessman in Shazam!, but there are sustained action sequences that might test those 8 years old who haven't seen an MCU movie before."
2564,"I was disappointed with this one. It was too long, too slow moving and just wasn't as good as the previous movies.[換行字元][換行字元]Well, when there's 22 (or something like that) Marvel movies in a decade, it's hard to get good writing on them all. This was the supposed ending though, so should've been the best of them all.[換行字元][換行字元]It was just meh. Average."
2565,"Greetings again from the darkness. In what was originally titled ""Avengers: Infinity War Part 2"", we get the much-anticipated conclusion to the most recent 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films ... specifically Phase 3. Regardless if you are a deep-rooted fanboy or a casual viewer, you likely know the questions heading into this finale:[換行字元][換行字元]Can the Avengers defeat Thanos? What role will Captain Marvel (and her pixie haircut) play? Will those who died in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR be brought back to life? Will Tony Stark/Iron Man make it back from drifting in space? Who will survive this final battle?[換行字元][換行字元]We knew this one had to be big, and in fact, it's colossal/humongous/monumental ... whatever your preferred adjective might be. And you can rest easy knowing that all of the above questions are answered quite clearly in this 3 hour epic from co-director brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and co-writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the same directors and writers behind AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR and a few other MCU entries).[換行字元][換行字元]Marvel has excelled over the past decade plus by combining interesting characters, understandable story lines, visually stunning effects, and clever humor. This finale offers all of that and more. In fact, it's difficult to imagine a more perfect ending to this galactic odyssey ... and I don't offer that praise lightly. From the use of Traffic's classic ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" and a gut-wrenching opening scene that yanks us right back into that feeling of dread provided by 'Infinity War', we know we are in for a ride that is quite a bit more somber and even more emotional than what we've come to expect.[換行字元][換行字元]The fallout from the Thanos snap is clear as we catch up with Black Widow, Captain America, Thor and Hulk. Each is dealing on their own terms, and while the Banner-Hulk merger is quite something to behold, trust me when I say, you've never imagined seeing Thor in his current state. This marks Chris Evans' 10th film as Captain America, and he is front and center through much of the film - as is, in a bit of a surprise, Karen Gillan as Nebula. It makes sense given her tie to Thanos, and Ms. Gillan holds up quite well in the spotlight.[換行字元][換行字元]Since the previous and speculation has been on time travel and the Quantum Realm, brace yourself for a bit of convoluted talk about how that works, but that's the closest thing to a negative I have to offer - and even that is offset by numerous punchlines at the expense of BACK TO THE FUTURE and most every other time travel movie ever made.[換行字元][換行字元]The theatre was packed with Dallas area critics and industry folks, and there was a significant amount of cheering, applauding and more than a few sniffles. Yes, this one will take you on an emotional journey as well as a visual one. It has a tough/emotional beginning and a tough/emotional ending. These are characters we've gotten to know over multiple films ... and you should know just about every major or mid-major character from every Marvel film makes an appearance, as do numerous minor ones. It's quite a remarkable reunion. And yes, the brilliance of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One more than offsets the Pepper Potts scenes.[換行字元][換行字元]Creator Stan Lee does get his final posthumous cameo (good for more applause), and there is a 'women's movement' moment that seems to be Marvel's ""we hear you"" statement. Much of what we see is ""inevitable"", but as the Avengers assemble this last time, we are there to laugh, cry and gasp. This is what happens when 'over-the-top' is 'just right'."
2566,Captain Marvel almost ruined the movie but it was ok.
2567,I cried a lot and it was painful but amazing. Now I'm just filling in words to make the review longer because I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone else
2568,Many times movies leave unanswered questions. This movie does an exceptional job of answering all of the open questions from the previous movies.
2569,"How you rate this other than a 10 is beyond me. I love infinity war and it's probably more #1 but this is a perfect film. I laughed,cried and cheered. The ending sets up the future movie's which I'm excited for. I'm assuming the black widow movie will be a origin story. Definitely worth watching!!!"
2570,"It's fair to say that this is a fitting climax not only to the avengers movies, but a large section of the Marvel universe. The film is action packed, generally keeps you at the edge of your seat, and remains faithful to the characters. It's long, but quite necessarily so."
2571,The best superhero movie this movie gave me a lot of feelings. I had a good time with them(Avengers) They were involved in a part of my life. GREAT MOVIE
2572,Best movie I've seen in my life. I cried last 15 minutes. They used characters good.
2573,"Thank you marvel for this wonderful movie. This movie made me laugh, cry and excited. This Movie is the ending of The infinity saga . It is truly the endgame"
2574,"What a brilliant finale to a wonderful saga, the infinity war saga will surely go down as one of the great cinematic achievements of all time. Avengers Endgame brings together all the characters we have grown to love and finishes the saga in a spectacular way. WHATEVER IT TAKES"
2575,"Goose bumps for three hours, dang my skin hurts. Total emotional awesomeness. Buff said. 😜"
2576,"Nowadays it is like a crime to say bad things against Marvel movies but someone has to tell the truth This movie is extremely over-hyped. The first 2 hours there was almost no action, it was unnecessary endless dialogs, flashbacks and seconds chances. When we thought we gonna see some action, it took 30 min only. And then back to aftermath dramas again. I like dramas and deep stories in the movies but we already know these characters stories. why to over-extend that much? Acting was empty and going nowhere, CGI was almost none since there was a limited action. If it was up to me i would wait for torrents buy my gf wanted to see so much and in the end she also got disappointed."
2577,"I could write a book about the emotional roller coaster I've been on this last decade. As a lifelong MCU fanatic, I can say I am beyond happy with how this journey started, progressed, and ended. Endgame was the perfect ending to this saga. As a 25 year old, I will probably never witness a cinematic adventure at such a scale ever again in my lifetime. All things considered, and without exaggeration, I can say this movie, after seeing all the MCU movies before it, is the greatest entertainment experience I have ever had."
2578,"I laughed, I cried, I exclaimed, I cried, I laughed, I cried and then I kept crying.[換行字元][換行字元]Rest assured, the writers do our heroes every justice they deserve, by closing long running arcs beautifully, albeit, sadly. It is a painful goodbye to the Infinity arc but they've done it superbly. The endgame of over 20 films, a saga spanning 11 years has culminated into something so powerful, so awe inspiring on the screen, I urge every one to watch it to feel firsthand, the beauty, the pain and triumph of our heroes.[換行字元][換行字元]Stan Lee is up there somewhere, smiling. And we too will learn to smile through our tears."
2579,"I wasted 3 hours from my live. Captain Marvel was much more interesting. It is like this movie is done just to be released, i don't believe that initial idea for this movie is what we watch now."
2580,"That was the best movie Marvel i ever seen, everything are brilliant the all actors unbelievable for acting that movie, it deserves any trophy in these years."
2581,"Humour,action,imprévu et une fin qui fera plaisir à tous les fans de Marvel"
2582,"So its all come down to this. I had my hunches on what was going to transpire. Some of it was correct but it was delivered well. In fact, really well. The film is long, too long. However, I rarely clock watched despite a feeling of being quite slow early on. It has an epic start and finish although the middle feels different to the usual. Thats not a bad thing. Im not the biggest superhero movie fan, I'm a little tired of the overused formulas. I think its a miracle they made this work having all superheros together at once, they did well. Overall though I cant escape the feeling of unevenness and feeling cheated by some of the abilities of the superheroes which do not feel even or equal out fairly on screen. Theres little feeling of tension as a result or dread. I didn't care for the characters enough in comparison to say the Dark Knight Trilogy. Its a good movie, no doubt about it but not sure its worth its absolute plaudits."
2583,"Agreed with the fact of overhype but the logic, the un necessary humor during time travel sequences, the almost no reason of captain marvel introduction before end game release, giving that shape to super smart Thor, .[換行字元][換行字元]..All these events tell you that at the end it's just the Russo's wish to do whatever they want...[換行字元][換行字元]With out the mind applied to end game logic .....Why should I believe the Russo's.[換行字元][換行字元]They are just ordinary film makers"
2584,"To all the M.C.U fans I would like to say that End-game isn't the best of Marvel. Infinity war was unpredictable and End-game is predictable, but it's all about sequencing and non linear approach which is the main idea behind every hyped movie. Everyone will enjoy this movie. It will make you doleful, and spellbounded at the same time but will satisfy your expectations. Sab kuch hai usme jo tum mangta tha😂😂 I would suggest everyone to take tissue packs with them. Emotional, heartbreaking, must watch, full of twists, great visual effects. It's a gift for fans, tears for lovers."
2585,I went to watch this film with high hopes and it did not disappoint me. It has the usual Marvel humor but at the same time the seriousness as plot calls for it.[換行字元][換行字元]I'm not an emotional person and rarely cried watching a film but this one put tears into my eyes. It is by far one of the best superhero films.
2586,"9.4/10 on imbd - probably voted by avengers fans.[換行字元][換行字元]This is a very average movie, weak storyline, no depth."
2587,"First thing I wanna say that this movie killed all our stereotypes about filming. 3-rd part of Avengers by 2018 was great and when we watched it then we thought better movie making is not possible. it was too broken stereotype. So, about Endgame. Three hours of absolute shock, especially for fan-experts in Marvel cinema universe. What happens with Hulk, what decisions makes Tony Stark who had trouble with Steve, how all Avengers change throughout the events... Incredibly. Dramaturgy is amazing. The movie's plot is very complicated so you should watch it really carefully to understand all the details and be able to see all the plot's layers. Let's sum up. Believe me, you won't get problem to watch it carefully as I said above) You will be bulged-in the cinema seat from the first mins of watching!"
2588,"If you have seen all the other 21 movies and loved them as much I did you are not ready for this ending trust me, it is perfect in every way. It's emotional, exciting, action packed and just an overall epic conclusion. Robert Downey JR deserves every award possible for an actor and the Russo brothers are just the best directors. Don't forget your tissues when you go see this movie trust me..."
2589,"You've got to be a real fan boi to give this clunker a review score of 10. Without the few decent action sequences, this might have been the worst movie period. Somewhat dull from start to finish."
2590,"For me Avengers Infinity War was perfect marvel movie. this one was ok, not great not fantastic, it's just ok. it would be great if they didnt force too much comedie into the movie where half of population went missing and it was normal that we have a kind of drama/action movie and not another comdie action (when you see thor and hulk you will know what I'm talking about). it's ok ending. captain marvel arrival feels like GoT night king lifting dead dragon with chains in the middle of nowhere and nothing.[換行字元][換行字元]I hope there will be some another edition, where they cut it all stupid, not funny scenes and present real dramatic through whole movie, and not only last half of hour"
2591,Simply the best movie ever
2592,Great way to say goodbye to some of the all time favorites
2593,"It perfectly concluded the movies I have been watching from the beginning. Acting was amazing, story was spectacular, and even though it was darker than most marvel movies, they still incorporated light-hearted comedy."
2594,"Although some plot resolution simplistic - how Antman is introduced and how they make up a plan - this movie truly shines on character development and the last battle.[換行字元][換行字元]You'll see almost every character from this 11 years of MCU some way or another, and how they interact with the main heroes is astounding.[換行字元][換行字元]There will be deep emotions in almost every scene, so you better be prepared to cry, laugh and cheer profoundly.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie's got the right amount of plot twists and they're very well placed, debunking many of the theories around the net.[換行字元][換行字元]Last battle is perfect and fully emotional, having every character's stories fulfilled, and, in my opinion, totally satisfactory.[換行字元][換行字元]TL;DR: This one is the most possible movie ever to worth your money, time and emotion. The biggest and best superhero movie of all time.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you very very much, Russo Brothers."
2595,"If you haven't watched this movie yet, please avoid other people(s) opinions and watch for yourself. The fact that this was the ""End,"" is sad. I have watched every movie pertaining to the characters and watched their journey over the years, so you will become attached to the characters. To see how the End game plays out is both exhilarating and heartbreaking. Don't want to spoil anything, so just watch it!"
2596,It's literally the best movie I've ever seen and I've seen quite a few but this was the best one. I mean sure there are a few corny Hollywood bits but the whole thing makes up for it. I just gonna have to say WATCH IT
2597,"Like most, I had very little idea what to expect going into Endgame other than vague theories and hoping it would be great (mainly because of the Russo brothers and how good Infinity War was). It really blew me away and I feel like I'm still processing it the next day.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie takes its time but this makes sense for the story it's telling. We feel the impact of the previous movie's events. We feel the loss and confusion. There are dead-ends and good reasons for characters to lose hope and accept their situation.[換行字元][換行字元]All the characters get shining moments, comedically and heroically, and without sacrificing who they are. The plot twists and turns in ways I hadn't anticipated and which make your heart skip a beat. It has some of the funniest moments in any MCU movie, but none of them detracts from the overall mood. The stakes are higher than ever with lots of ups and downs and close calls.[換行字元][換行字元]There are some very touching character moments which work by themselves but are even more meaningful in the wider context of what happens. Every scene is there for a reason and helps increase the impact of a later or earlier part. I was reminded of LotR: The Return of the King in the grand scale of some parts of Endgame. Few movies can give you chills on that level. I found it darker and more intense than Infinity War. Other movies like Schindler's List, Forrest Gump and E.T. also affected me deeply and Endgame now joins that list.[換行字元][換行字元]There may well be plot holes, but it's not hard to suspend disbelief or come up with ways to understand them. The important thing is that we get what's going on at any given point in time and feel that the character's generally make logical choices. The villain(s) are intimidating and intelligent, not wasting any time to use whatever advantages they have. The heroes also have a sense of urgency and pull off some brilliant stunts - there are a lot of satisfying, earned, crowd-pleasing moments.[換行字元][換行字元]This certainly feels like the end of an era for multiple reasons. It's a great send-off for some characters especially and sets the bar extremely high in terms of action, creativity and raw emotion for future MCU and other superhero movies."
2598,"This film is amazing and is a roller-coaster of emotions. I 100% recommend you watch this film if you are a marvel fan. And if you're not a fan and have not seen many marvel films, its still alright to watch as long as you have seen infinity war."
2599,"Wow. Phew.[換行字元][換行字元]It is hard to put in words the emotions I went through after watching this epic. The 10 years journey with this cinematic universe comes to an end and how. Avengers: Endgame is that final piece of the puzzle which MARVEL puts it out in style. The movie is a treat in every possible way for the loyal fans and also for the 'hype' crowd. The action, the humour, emotions and the characterization are blended in so well. The story is an epic journey with some great nostalgic elements thrown in. The fans who have followed the universe are going to relate and love every bit of it.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie does not need a review, it does not need a brief overview. Even if I try, I cannot possibly write about the characters and how good everyone were. This is a movie to be experienced in the cinemas.

2600,"This movie had so much riding on it, and it wins in every way, shape, and form. Avengers: Endgame manages to hold onto the comedy and drama the franchise is known for while being the most emotional film in the genre. In the theater there was an immense amount of crying, cheering, and laughing from the emotional opening scene to the absolutely epic and action-packed finale.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers: Endgame is easily the best film in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe and one of my favorite movies of all time."
2601,"Had some really good twists, overall awesome 3 hours!"
2602,Fruitful movie with lots of surprises. I believe i didn't witness a better movie than this.
2603,Excellent movie! Recommended! Especially for people who like this kind of movies!
2604,Epic historic beautiful BIG Marvel Celebrates Film Journey Reaffirming All American Superhero Myth
2605,Nice to watch it. But if you did not watch other movies of this series you understand nothing
2606,"Usually when I go into a movie with high expectations I'm disappointed by the reality of the viewing: this was a total exception. Even with all of the build up, this film delivered on every level. Beautifully crafted, well-written and equally balanced with moments of action and heart, I felt entirely satisfied. It was so engrossing that I was surprised when it ended and I realised three hours had passed. It's rare for a modern film to be so enriching while also appropriate; apart from violence and a tiny bit of language, it was entirely wholesome. What an absolute masterpiece!"
2607,"I haven't watched all movies before it, I've watched Infinity War and learnt about most characters from my friend who is a die hard Marvel fan, so I have all the necessary information somehow covered to enjoy this movie, and boy did I enjoy every bit of it. Where do I begin? The writing, the directing, the acting was on point, all the scenes were great, the collusion between Thanos and his bad guys and the beloved Avengers, it was all perfectly executed. A huge cinematic success regardless of what you think of Marvel, I can say this movie qualifies to be nominated by the big awards. Funny moments, sad moments, happy moments, action moments, an all in experience and made me want to start over with all of the 21 movies leading to this one, hats off, this movie is DEFINITELY worth seeing. 10/10"
2608,I was scared that the ending would be boring.[換行字元][換行字元]I cried at the end and I never cry because of a movie. Perfect ending. Sadly there was no post credit scene.
2609,It was action-packed. Excellent special effects. It contains surprises. As a true Marvel fan I can say with confidence it was the best Marvel movie to date.
2610,This was a great way to end the Avengers Series. Pulled on every emotion.
2611,Just go watch it and you will find why 🙂🙂. You can't miss it for any reason. 👍👍👍
2612,11 years!! 22 Movies!! And Such a beautiful ending This is the finest work from Marvel Cinematic Universe.Every character played their part perfectly! Great Story! Great Direction! MCU LOVE YOU 3000
2613,"Fabulous,epic,best superhero movie until now . Salute to Russo brothers and the casts who made this movie epic. Please go and watch in theatres. #DontSpoilTheEndgame"
2614,This is the movie everyone will love to see.. But you should be a true mcu fan to feel the film
2615,"I'm just speechless what I saw. You just need to see this movie. 21 movies, 10 years and a perfect conclusion of this saga. Avengers: Endgame is the best superhero movie ever. It's just have everything to get satisfied. I'm not that emotional in life but this movie, this damn movie... It's just breaks you. Avengers: Endgame was very important for me even that I'm not that very Marvel fan but damn.. I'm just happy how it ended."
2616,"I Saw all the MCU movies, And for me, this one is the best."
2617,"Three hours wasted, was about as good as declawing my dog and at least I like the dog. The storyline was terrible, and for many blatantly obvious reasons made no senses, to make matters worse it seemed to have more holes in it, than my old gym socks. Yes I know all the good guys weren't going to make it, everyone knew that, I actually hoped a few wouldn't make it, and that's not what I care about, this movie was rubbish it labored three hours to get to the point of dead good guys/bad guys then victory and bang happy ever after for two minutes then over. This is going straight in the never watch again list, unless trapped on a plane in which case fingers crossed for a parachute, but will jump without one."
2618,"The biggest takeaway from 'Avengers: End Game' is just how much of an emotional roller coaster it is. There are countless opportunities to laugh out loud throughout the three hour movie-our personal favorite was the line ""pick a side, Lebowski""-which themselves are perfectly balanced (pun intended) by thrilling action sequences, nostalgic interludes, and genuine moments of sadness.[換行字元][換行字元]Despite Endgame representing the denouement of the Avengers franchise (and the 22nd film to be released by Marvel Studios for the Marvel Cinematic Universe) the movie itself is also surprisingly self-contained. The only thing anybody would have to know going into the film is that Thanos snapped his fingers at the end of the last installment and half of all living things vanished into dust.[換行字元][換行字元]Speaking of Thanos, his arc is presented most masterfully of all, far more unexpected and complex than anyone could've reasonably guessed. And as of this moment there's a brilliant Easter Egg on Google celebrating the opening of 'Avengers: End Game.' Google ""Thanos"" then click on the Gauntlet icon containing the infinity stones on the right hand side of the screen. Enjoy.[換行字元][換行字元]Rating: 8.5/10"
2619,"More is not always better and a lot more is definitely mind-bogglingly hard to wrap one's senses around. After a slow build that effuses with emotional and relational devastation the movie thae turns towards a building resolution with multiple scenes of bravery and sometimes sacrifice. With so many super characters and subplots, its pretty difficult to really absorb the more intimate prolonged exposure that most dramatic movies offer. There are numerous attempts of pushing the audience's emotional buttons that abound in this superhero finale and in that effort there are a number of typical and well-execute ploys by scriptwriters to milk the scenes for all their worth. This grab bag of personas and dramatic and comedic turmoil all come together in a pretty full package that at times bulges at the seams. This is a movie that tries really hard to encompass the full panoply of the Marvel Universe which is likely too big for just one or perhaps two full length films to capture comprehensively or adequately. But nice, if impossible try."
2620,"This marvel movie, is such an brilliant and imaginative film. It is fully loaded with sad, funny, happy, and thrilling scenes. I have never enjoyed a marvel movie as much as this one. . . and I love marvel and have seen them all."
2621,"Watching movie took me back to the feeling I got while watching the first Spiderman as a 6 year old boy in 2002. Me and my friends who ofcourse watched all movies watched Endgame today and we all cried. We cried out of happiness, we cried out of sadness, we cried because the story was beautiful. I would strongly recommend this movie to literally everyone whove seen the marvel movies, you will absolutely not regret it. I would watch this movie again, anytime."
2622,This film is the best thing i saw in the last 10 years
2623,"For 10 years , it has been leading to this ... and I'm not disappointed , but a little sad to say goodbye - we can't spit on it but they've become icons of our generations For a guy like , it was very emmotional , even if it's not the best superhero film of all time , you can't deny , it ends perfectly the saga ; it's like a perfect circle coming to an end Even with a lot dose of humor and a first part with low pace and some incoherence but the narrative structure is good (better than IW) , it's not just fight and action ; there are really great moments of epicness , emotional and drama Thanks to the whole cast (thanks RDJ) , you made grow up - and that's the most important PS : It was an ENDGAME for me :)"
2624,The end of a 10 year old story that really touches your heart and brings you back to your childhood .
2625,"I loved this movie it was great. The beginning was a bit weak but further into the film it got better and better. I even cried, 3 hours of fun and emotional twists, the Jokes were good they where timed good and they were fun, it really added more sympathy to the characters.[換行字元][換行字元]10 out of 10 this is a must see"
2626,This title makes you laugh and cry in sequential moments. One more perfection movie in Marvel history. I cried so much in the final. I really recommend you to watch this worder of history of cinema.
2627,"If you're a marvel fan that has been waiting for this since day 1 this is your film the Russo's single handily gave us everything we wanted to see. Throughout the movie I was giddy with excitement over references from iron man 1 and 3, captain america winter soldier, ant man and the wasp, absolutely every film made by Marvel truly tying in the whole MCU in a wonderful finale giving you exactly what you want. You'll love it x3000 I guarantee you that."
2628,"Before you start tearing your eyes out because you think this film was a masterpiece, I can assure you that it most certainly was not. Was it fun to watch? Absolutely. It was fun and funny but the film is riddled with plot holes and attempts to alter its entire arc to accommodate a wider universe that apparently relies on Captain Marvel which makes no sense. The film felt very lazy when it came to the interweaving of ten years of previous films and ultimately falls flat on its face. Perhaps the films after this will fix the mistakes but calling it the end of the infinity saga leads us to believe it is the beginning of an entirely new timeline saga since the timeline we knew is now long gone. Yes, despite cap returning the stones, the timeline we originally loved is now the past and this new five year ahead timeline is the world they want us to live in. No thanks. You'll need to earn my trust back."
2629,I loved it 3000.[換行字元][換行字元]Amazing movie. Recommendation is to watch in big screen.
2630,"I never have seen any movie in life that has such a great action and awesome fantasy , I am speechless and all I can say is bravo and will done."
2631,"Ok so it wasn't perfect... but came pretty darn close and I like to round up so I'll give 10/10. It had a few flaws like the way it used Thor, which was a little disrespectful but he brings some great comedic relief and when it's time for him to shine he sure does. The whole time travel idea was great and all but it leaves you with A LOT of questions. It gives you the best conclusion to this amazing franchise you could ask for. Full of unexpected twists... just know your in for a thrill."
2632,"End of era. Worth watching. There is every thing which is required in a perfect movie. There is drama, action, emotion, every rhi[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you Stan Lee."
2633,"One of the best movies I have seen in a long time, I never really got into MCU movies but after watching this I've been obsessed"
2634,"Just go and watch it, it's amazing. Such a satisfying ending but now there's nothing else to look forward too :(((("
2635,Perfect way to cap off the end of 10 years of the MCU. Wows from start to finish and doesn't disappoint. Best movie I have ever seen. Can't wait to see it again!
2636,Entertain yourself not more New movie came out.. I watched it.. it was incredible absolutely recommend it to everyone out there.... this movie is the real MVP and the best there is... And the ending was just amazing It perfectly fit onto the marvel saga and it was the best marvel movie hence the visual effects.
2637,Movie could not have ended in a much better way. All characters given perfect screen space. Loved it.
2638,This was the movie I dreamed about as a kid. A big thank you to the Russo brothers and everyone else that put their everything into making every moment of the film spectacular. And thank you Marvel for all lenghts it took to keep leaks and spoilers from ruining anything for us up to the release date.
2639,"The story was well written, seeded with humorous as well as tearful scenes. It tied together the multiple stories of it's legendary characters with decent closure. Were there plot holes, yes, but this is sci/fi fantasy. am I going to spoil it... no, I encourage you to watch it.

2641,"The story was action packed, emotional, and full of great laughs that was perfectly balanced. When a movie can get the whole theater to be laughing, gasping, cheering, and crying out loud, to me you have made a great movie. Would/will watch again!"
2642,"Avengers Endgame is a thrilling conclusion to Marvel Phase 3. Excluding spoilers, it combines emotion, laughter and action all in one throughout the almost three hour film. I enjoyed this film thoroughly and recommend it for any and everyone!"
2643,"Epic, Emotional, Funny, Great plot and memorable ending. All six original avengers will be in our heart forever."
2644,"With the events that occurred in Avengers: Infinity War (man was that film a riot) it left me speechless and not even knowing what was gonna happen next. So you can obviously assume that I was going into Avengers: Endgame with super high hopes. Probably with more higher hopes than any other theater experience for me. Not only were those hopes granted, but they were exceeded.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers: Endgame really is a film to be seen by all. Not only is it a cinematic epic, you will feel something you've never felt before with any other movie experience. Avengers: Endgame is by far the most epic, emotional, heart-wrenching, and action packed feature that Marvel has ever released. You will have moments have laughter, anger, sadness, hopefulness, etc. All emotions you could think of from watching a movie is all here.[換行字元][換行字元]Every character that you've come to know and love gets the right amount of screen time. Each play a part and some even give us some very unexpected surprises, but in a good way. All the actors from Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man to Brie Larson as Captain Marvel give great performances. Some even having their best moments in this movie. Josh Brolin as Thanos will give you chills just as epic as the ones he displayed from Avengers: Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]The story's got more weight to it than it does from its predecessor. You don't expect how the story will go and which decisions will be made by the characters. This movie gives us many surprises. Definitely some of the best writing a Marvel production has given us.[換行字元][換行字元]I just wanna give my highest respects to the directors Joe and Anthony Russo for giving us such a masterful experience. For a studio to build up eleven years leading up to this film that has satisfied me and many others, that is a tremendous accomplishment within itself. Also a huge s/o to the actors who have been playing these timeless characters for years and for making them feel incredibly real. All who helped make this movie come into existence should receive high praises.[換行字元][換行字元]What else can I say. It is the greatest super hero movie I've ever seen. All I can do left is to tell you to go see it if you haven't already. For those who have been dedicated fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for years or if they are new in the game, you will not regret seeing this. It is a thrill that must be seen to be believed."
2645,Just amazing. The humour combined with the emotional turmoil makes this one of the greatest films ever. I didn't think there could be a fight scene as intense as infinity war...I was wrong. Just amazing!
2646,"I've been a big fan of Marvel, for a long time. So believe me when I say, this is my favorite movie of all time. It could use some work, but hey it deserves a ten even if it should probably be a nine or eight. Watch the movie you'll enjoy it."
2647,10/10❤ Best film i've ever seen. I need to go and watch this 1 more time😍😍JUST PERFECT❤ Thank you Marvel❤
2648,Far surpasses the hype. Going back again as soon as possible for an IMAX experience.
2649,"Not a bad movie Could be better. Graphics were great 👏 The thor character was not good at the story We were more excited than the story This movie has put a lot of questions?! In the end, thank you to the friends who make the movies relevant to the viewer.💙"
2650,"Deffo a movie worth watching. Great throughout the movie, but 1 or 2 improvement could be done."
2651,"Film is way too overstretched for its own liking and becomes a monotonous affair for most of its part.Story also lacks coherence and the screenplay seems way too predictable.The script is too convenient and at some point becomes hard too digest.Best part of the film remains an adorable hulk,hillarious Thor and an enigma of perfection Captain America.Battle scenes are the USP of the film. Overall it is a one time watch at best.It would take an Endgame kind of an effort to sit through this movie again.It could have been easily trimmed by almost 30-40 minutes but the compulsion of showing each and every character without weighing their usefulness make this movie a soul missing drag"
2652,"Sometimes I feel like some IMDb trolls purposefully downvote something to keep overrated movies at the top of the all time list. I don't remember a movie matching and exceeding THIS big of hype. It's a great ending to a crapload of marvel movies. Makes you want to go back and watch all of them again. Plus when can you remember the last time you actually weren't sure if a character was going to die or if the good guys were going to win. If you didn't have at least a tad of doubt, you're in denial. Infinity War was a tiny bit better imo but they are both epic! Every movie is going to have plot holes if you sit there and pick it apart forever. Guaranteed you could claim plot holes in q documentary if you tried (these days i wouldnt doubt some idiot has). Good for you, you are so smart! No fooling you! Enjoy the entertainment and eat some popcorn. Let yourself enjoy life and dont worry about wanting to be pissed off/unimpressed all the time. My goodness. 10/10"
2653,Even though in a country like Afghanistan no one is interested in movies and no one is a movie lover but I am MCU made a movie lover specially Iron Man but Endgame was the best movie I have ever seen. while seeing Stark tears were coming from my eyes for the first time avengers endgame is.....
2654,You are putting yourself at a disadvantage if you never see this movie. The perfect ending to the perfect franchise.
2655,A different feel than your typical avengers movie. More of an adventure than the usual action packed flick which I felt was refreshing. Sacrifices with legitimate weight behind them a great mix of intensity and emotion.
2656,Best. Movie. Ever. It says my review isn't long enough yet so im just gonna copy and past best movie ever until it lets me post.

2660,Simply amazing. One of greatest Superhero films I've ever seen. Well done Marvel and the team for a incredible movie. You guys really outdone yourself this time and I can't wait for what lies ahead for the MCU. Like alot people I grew up watching these movies and reading comics so alot of these characters helped me alot when I was a kid. Thank you
2661,"There is one way to describe this movie and that is satisfying. It is satisfying in the way that everything you would want to see resolved is resolved and even things established in other movies have conclusions/payoffs. There are too many standout moments to count as everyone will have their own favorite moment. I don't know if we will ever see something like this ever again from marvel, but it is a movie that must be seen if you have invested your time in all these characters. You will not be disappointed"
2662,"A 3 hours Marvel film with 2.5 hours of drama, 15 mins of actions and 15 mins of something else.. seriously?[換行字元][換行字元]Their logic didn't make any sense.[換行字元][換行字元]Besides, what they did to Thor was brutal."
2663,"Thought it was solid. Everything was intense as hell until that gay ass ""girl power"" scene during the final battle."
2664,The most beautiful ending that I have ever seen in superheroes movie.
2665,"I'll keep it as short as possible and spoiler free, I didn't expect this movie to be better than Infinity War but it was a disappointment, unfortunately... The cons first: a) This movie is almost an MCU clip show. I won't spoil the plot but to me it felt repetitive. Like eating reheated pizza. b) Too slow. Do you remember the action sequences and the fast pace of Infinity War? Forget that. Literaly there's almost no action for the first one hour and a half! c) Dispropotional screen time. Unlike infinity War, the majority of superheroes have too little screen time (I'm talking about fighting scenes). Again, I can't spoil anything but some heroes have two or three lines and a ten second action scene. d) Thanos himself. Unfortunatelly Thanos wasn't as good (or should I say... bad) as he was in Infinity War, he almost feels like a heavy bag with a few lines (and I mean few). e) Predictable plot (maybe that's only me). f) The final big battle feels hasty and bad edited. There are too much going on on screen with a very little time for each character. g) It has a pessimistic and dark tone. Now the pros: a) Solid conclusion. The movie is a solid conclusion of MCU's phase 3 (and perhaps MCU itself). b) Good humor. That's not a surprise for a Marvel movie, there's plenty of tasteful humor and in the correct amount. c) Good performances. Nothing to add here. d) No political agendas. I hate it when it happens and thankfully this movie is ok (there are one or two cringeworthy scenes though, but nothing importand). e) There are some good action scenes and the effects are awesome. Overall, it felt rushed and it lacks the majestic feeling of Infinity War. I can remember plenty of scenes in Infinity War which gave me goosebumps, unfortunately there's none in Endgame... Final verdict: 6/10 when I compare it to Infinity War (it's unavoidable), 7/10 as a stand-alone MCU film. In my opinion it's the third best Avengers movie (right below Infinity War and the first one). I didn't regret watching it at the theater, in fact I suggest you to do it, but I won't watch it a second time..."
2666,"I've watched the movie at the fan night first show all hyped up and wearing my quantum suite hoodie and came out of the movie with mixed feelings and confusion and here's why so , The first reason is actually a question I've asked myself while heading home from the movie , Is it really a new era that the superheroes must die at the end of their acting contract ! Is it how will it be from now on ! That might be a kiddish question that goes into a kid watching a movie of his favorite superhero and he's getting killed or die at the end of this movie , but who we are but kids within ourselves while watching these movies ! First time I hate watching a superhero movie was when Zach Sanders decided to kill superman at the end of "" Batman Vs Superman "" even that he gave a little hint by raising the dust over his coffin and also brought him back in the "" justice league"" movie but I did get out of that movie heart broken , the kid inside me was crying , save the world but don't die ! It's not trading lives ! A hero can die fighting for his heroic action with honor and respect but superhero for me is the one who can fight and win and keep going in his heroic action , he is meant to live within each one of us , I don't go to watch superhero movie to see him at the end of the movie ! Even to save the universe ! Or to save the day ! They also killed Logan at the end of his solo movie ! And now tony Stark ! So what's the point of becoming a superhero movie fan , follow a favorite superhero and then watch him die at the end of his contract just because the director decided so or the actor himself wanted no other to take his role ! What a disappointing feeling is that ! And can that be satisfying to any superhero fan ! If that's how the franchises are going to embrace from now and on then goodbye to the imaginary worlds we all loved and enjoyed . I didn't say too much about the movie but I can summarize the huge amount of feelings I had after it in one word "" disappointing "" ."
2667,"The Russo brothers have created their ultimate art piece, Endgame dwafs the other 22 MCU films with unbelievable brilliance. The plot is rich and well thought out, it is easy to follow and ties a beautiful bow around so many unanswered questions, nerdy desires and the MCU story. The film provides so many moments of satisfaction and enjoyment, I would challenge anyone who states that Endgame was not an enjoyable film. It is reasonable to understand that people may dislike the film if they have not seen the prior installments in the MCU franchise, however Endgame isn't designed to be a one off, it has been crafted to bring a conclusion to the past decade of marvel cinematography. I would like to thank the Russo brothers for successfully pulling this film off and subverting my expectations after the initial 10-20 minutes. Marvel fans will not be disappointed"
2668,"Endgame is a good movie which achieves its ultimate goal of tieing the series, up to now, together. But frankly it's a mess....sometimes a glorious mess but often an incoherent mess. There's a lot to love, but a lot to dismiss. It lacks any great action scenes and spends too much time in discussion, and hackneyed emotional nonsense. The plot is over-stuffed, and the movie suffers from trying to do too much. However, it frequently looks spectacular and is genuinely funny, the clear highlights are Thor, who is hilarious in every scene and Ant-Man who brings levity to a sometimes dour plot.[換行字元][換行字元]It's a solid film, but it's not great. 7/10"
2669,"Out of all 22 Marvel movies I have seen, this is the best superhero movie I have seen in the Marvel franchise. Well written, organized, and emotional!"
2670,"AVENGERS END GAME REVIEW :-[換行字元][換行字元]Marvel took a decade to set the ""End Game"" on high standard and that plan has worked big time. We can feel the buzz, the hype all around the globe. Finally the Final Chapter in Avengers saga is revealed and does it live upto the hype? Yes, it does. Avengers End Game has every freaking element of heavy Commercial entertainer along with moving climax for die hard Marvel lovers and a fulfill end to the journey.[換行字元][換行字元]End Game was awaited for the one final Slash on the deadliest villain who killed half the universe with just one snap. People were excited to see how remaining superheroes battles with Thanos and do they survive? The script is 180 minutes long which is perhaps the longest film in Marvel Cinematic Universe so as expected it takes time to settle the atmosphere. Unexpectedly, Russo tries some Intellectual kind of stuff to get it right but leaves so many goofs which remains unanswered. After getting it right, since 140 minutes are gone, finally you get to witness what you actually wanted to see in this film from the start. The visually stunning phenomena takes charge and you just can't stop screaming out loud for your favorite superheroes.[換行字元][換行字元]The climax fight is followed by bit of emotional portion where you have to say goodbye to your superheroes. Marvel ends it good, but is it good enough? Is there anything new to see? Answer is No. End Game is the same Marvel stuff we have been watching since a decade, except that one segment where all the Marvel Superheroes comes together for the first and last time. Russo tried thier ordinary version of Quantam Physics but doesn't explain the theory till the core, in addition they took so much time to set the plot. Overall, Avengers is a complete Winner package and will rule the box office but it is not that High level Cinematic Experience which can be remembered for years. If tou like all the previous films of Marvel Cinematic Universe then this is something more for you, so don't miss it.[換行字元][換行字元]RATING- 7/10*"
2671,"If you waiting reality then this type of movie isn't for you. I watch for entertainment and to get out of reality for awhile and this movie was great for me and all who went with me. So ""Nay-Sayers"" maybe you should stay home and watch reality TV there. I loved this movie"
2672,A breathtaking experience. Marvel played it's top trump card and blew alway any competition from start to finish. The battle scene is simply one of the if not greatest pieces of cinema ever. But it kept on giving after this. Anyone who gives this film less than a 10 is selling it extremely short.
2673,This movie makes fans of got dream about getting Russo brothers to direct got's last season these two have exceeded thier limits and have given marvel movies an ending they deserve and the treatment to the characters has been something got should take lesson . Incredible direction acting and movie
2674,This is one of those rare movies that it seems pointless to write a review because its so good. In fact its so good finding something to criticize here will only make you look petty.
2675,"A good and must see movie for sure... Altough i feel a mixed emotions about an overall look....maybe i will have to see it again.The caracter wheight importantance distribution is always difficult on a title gathering so many stars and key elements, and in some point i felted that 3 hour movie is little to explore the whole thing on every caracter. So of realy important to say here, is action filled, with interesting twist and a conclusion of an epic challenge.For me a solid 8 for now .will see it again and re edit this review . For a true allthe way fan Go see it... the movie theatres still flooding to see this ..is a good sign"
2676,"I think this is one of the best films in Hollywood history. Although the film has a lot of mystery I do not know when these mysteries will be solved. There is a request for those who have not yet seen this movie, please go to the nearest theatre and watch that movie."
2677,"I've watched infinity wars at least 10 ten times, why because there is some cool stuff to watch. I can tell you now I wont be watching end game again.[換行字元][換行字元]It's ok but when the best part is Thor & Co instead of a new galactic threat you know they've screwed up.[換行字元][換行字元]And boy the cheese was insane! Yeah some of it is genuinely sad, but I want more action in a 3 hour Marvel movie.[換行字元][換行字元]I won't get started on Danvers boy we were sold short on her, like really short.[換行字元][換行字元]So much BS in this movie, reminded me of Transformers. Nuff said."
2678,"Everything that's happened over the past 11 years has been leading to this, and it's all put together beautifully. In my opinion, there are 3 movies to rewatch before watching Endgame: Iron Man 1, Winter Soldier, and Infinity War."
2679,"Avengers: Endgame indescribable! It has some of the best visual effects I have ever seen in a motion picture! It is very respectful to it's characters and has a great story, but most of all, it ends the story perfectly! This is cinema gold! I cried and laughed and got all of the emotions! What more would you want from a film? Go see it!"
2680,Just came out of the cinema. It was pretty good. Nice way now to end the avengers. Enjoy.
2681,"Feeling bad for tony though, This was hell of show. Well done marvel👍"
2682,"Hulk? Barely fought and not even a rematch between him and Thanos The villains? Killed without breaking a sweat even though they were near invincible in Infinity War Thor? As an obese? Nah. Not working. Thanos himself? Just a super villain. You didn't have any sympathy for him as you did in Infinity War. His whole character was gone[換行字元][換行字元]Lastly, much of the humor was low-grade.. infinity war is by far the best og the 4 movies"
2683,"Excellent, the Best of the Best ! Great 10 years of MCU 🍷"
2684,"Avengers: Endgame brilliantly brings our heroes back again for a movie that fans all over the world were waiting for after the events of Avengers: Infinity War. After waiting for this movie to come to cinemas for a year I am happy to say that Endgame kept me on the edge of my seat from the get go. From beginning, middle and end I was always waiting for the next moment to occur with anxious breathing and nervous sweating because I truly wanted the heroes I have grown up watching to make it out alive. This movie is almost perfect and if you have not seen this movie yet or haven't seen the rest of the Marvel series yet (some how)! Then you must watch this movie A.S.A.P when you have time because movies like this are a once in a lifetime opportunity to see and it would be horrible if you missed out. So, grab your favourite drink and get ready for 3 hours of nail biting, nervous sweating fun!"
2685,"I went to see the re release of Avengers endgame last Friday. I had already seen the film back in May and was not disappointed. It is still a great film and an impressive cinematic achievement BUT is Disney that desperate to make a few more bucks alienating Marvel fans? Can you call those extra few minutes anything else than cheap, badly put together, bonus dvd stuff? Do they have any respect for their audience? NO"
2686,"Avengers: Infinity War was overwhelming, but Endgame dwarfed everything else I've seen in the MCU before.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie feels exactly what it should be like a conlusion and clear he is not conlusion of the MCU but the conlusion of the Infinity Saga. Endgame does just about everything a superhero finale can do properly, he maintains brilliantly though there's less action than in Infinity War, which is a bit risky for a Marvel movie but it works in the time the movie has to do without action you take the time for the characters, where you really feel. What makes Endgame so special is that it focuses on the founding members of the Avengers, because here we experience again the development of the characters we have met over the time in the MCU, every character gets its appropriate conclusion in the Infinty saga and everything makes sense. With 3 hours runtime Endgame is the longest movie in the MCU but Endgame manages to perfectly fill this runtime, in time the plot is told understandable and without boredom, so that the 3 hours look relatively entertaining, it lets the tension rise and cheers us on. Endgame spends most of its time with little to no action, which is about 2/3 of the time here, in the last third Endgame picks up massive speed, in this part of the movie we're not just served with the usual action, the like Spectacular like all MCU films together, but also with deep emotionality and the usual humor, endgame manages to endure and captivate from beginning to end.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is the most expensive movie of all time with $ 356 million and you can see it all in the movie because the visual effects look so great like never before and the movie does not look too artificial or CGI-heavy at all always falls naturally on the actors. Alone for that Endgame deserves a huge praise.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is epic, entertaining, captivating, highly emotional and visually simple imprinting. This movie will astonish a Marvel fan, make you laugh and make you cry. That's why Endgame is a perfect superhero movie for me, and there's nothing wrong with it, which is why I forgive the full score."
2687,Perfect! Only missed deadpool in the post credit. Imagining him beeing late for the battle..
2688,"If you're a fan of the MCU obviously you have seen their 22-story entry landmark that is this year's AVENGERS: ENDGAME -- the biggest MCU movie yet, in all of its eleven years of movies. ENDGAME absolutely delivers and pushes so many boundaries and limits. If you set your expectations high you'll still likely be shocked more so than you thought you'd be because of how epic it is. You'd think maybe, just maybe, after three hours you'd get bored but it manages to capture and hold the viewer and provides tons of laughs, action and heartfelt, emotionally-punching scenes throughout its entirety. Act II is great and Act III is by far the best Act of any MCU film to date. The original six Avengers' actors deserve the most praise by all means, and Paul Rudd gives his best and peak performance yet as Scott Lang / Ant-Man. There are so many breathtaking and solid scenes throughout and the movie showcases an abundance of characters, particularly in its closing. You'll see, if by chance you haven't seen it yet.[換行字元][換行字元]It's as close to a masterpiece as you're gonna get."
2689,I am a huge fan of marvel. And I was pretty sure that this movie will be legend. And to me it is LEGEND.Scenes was awesome. The scenario was awesome.I think every marvel fan should watch this movie...
2690,"For me, very boring and the characters persona as they were before just ruined in this movie. I have greatly enjoyed every Marvel movie except this one."
2691,"Hail yeah! Good! However, it was supposed to be better; Some things were not appreciated! The last part was not going to be taken.[換行字元][換行字元]It was not allowed to end!"
2692,It was really bad. Incredibly slow. The plot was full of holes and they pretty much destroyed some of the best characters ever.[換行字元][換行字元]Just a really bad movie.
2693,"I keep my expectations low for this movie. And it's turn out AMAZING!!![換行字元][換行字元]Once is never enough, I Will watch it again and again. I'm not ready for this movie. Prepare yourself guys.."
2694,"Emotional scenes, intense action, lots of funny scenes."
2695,"At first act it was kinda slow, but that slow literally put more attention on the drama. But, throughout the movie, Action was great and perfect. This movie tells us that this is the Endgame definitely, a movie needs to watch and this is the best movie of MCU."
2696,"Just wanted to express my gratitude to Marvel. Thanks for giving us such an amazing 11 years, we are really fortunate to have lived in this era."
2697,Move was good but not great. Lots of plot holes and movie felt way too dragged out. No real surprises since you saw everything coming. My son and I would rate this as the 3rd best Avengers movie. Infinity war being better and the original.
2698,I have no words to describe the feeling about this way to end the journey
2699,Although a huge movie it still made time for small character work and conclusions to the smallest of details left in the MCU. A perfect finish!
2700,"End game The film ""End game"" will have you at the edge of your seat!! It was directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo presented in April of 2019. End game was like a never seen before film. You will have so many different emotions watching this film. Every seen is daring and you could never guess what would happen next. Some of the most powerful super heros made sacrifices just to save our world(earth). Everything in this film was believable, Characters played their roles so well. Especially Karen Gillan (Nebula), She did a great job playing off her role and making it believable. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves action! The film doesn't have much fighting but i guarantee you will not get bored watching."
2701,Please go and watch it ! Make your own mind up. My son was in tears.... So was I......:)
2702,Perfect just one disappointing this is that there was Fortnite in the movie :(
2703,Went into movie theater expecting an epic finale and a much better movie than infinity war; alas it was so anti climatic so boring so full of plot holes an elephant would've passed through them - or a hulk for that matter - very disappointing movie overall!!!
2704,Too much whining! No coherency! Completely convoluted theory about time travelling. I thought they would make something great but what the hell was that!
2705,"Loved it so much, just can't see a story with so much depth getting better."
2706,"Story wasn't good, very disappointing. But I would say that the ending was the best in Endgame."
2707,THE best movie series ever! So touching at the end but full of action during whole time. End of a great story!
2708,"All i can say is its perfect. It made us laugh, scream, happy and cry. It doesn't feel 3 hours at all. Congratulations to everyone in this movie."
2709,"Overrated, 2 boring hours and 1 hour fighting. A movie that depends on the effects only"
2710,"Just watched this in cinema today and i'm not disappointed. First few minutes were slow, but it gets very intriguing after that. Most of the action scenes come towards the end of the movie and they were very good, but I wish it had more or lasted longer. I felt the story was good and made sense, but there's probably some cliches or plot holes that I don't know about lol. It's a good movie, not the greatest movie ever like some people say, that's The Shawshank Redemption for me, but it's still one of the best action movies and worth a watch."
2711,I am not gonna spoil for those who didn't watch this movie yet... I am just gonna say Thank You Marvel and specially Thank You Robert <3
2712,"You will laugh. You will cry. You will cheer.[換行字元][換行字元]This film delivers, whether it's your first viewing or your third. This is what the MCU is all about."
2713,"To say this movie was awesome is an understatement. I'm still processing everything but OMG was it truly a masterpiece. I'm struggling to think if I've ever given a 10 before, but if I have it's only ever been one or two in my life. This certainly was a 10... However you definitely need to see ALL the movies from 2008's Iron Man through Infinity war. And I do mean ALL of them for this movie to truly shine or even to make sense. Even given the 3 hour running time this movie makes no attempts to fill you in, and nor should it. You need to be well prepared going into this[換行字元][換行字元]That said I saw the opening night fan event showing, and got a commemorative coin that is actually metal, heavy, and super cool! But it was shown in a regular theater with mediocre sound, so I also have tickets for a showing on Friday as well in a Dolby theater room, which I can't wait to see. Now I loved Avengers Infinity War, but I laughed, cheered and got way more emotional in this movie than that one. I've been in theaters where the crowd cheered or laughed before, but I don't think I've ever seen it let alone experienced it to this degree. The emotions were just flowing to say the least.[換行字元][換行字元]I really liked how the first act brought you into the aftermath of this post-snap world, and really focused on the hardship of what things would have been like after such an event. And while this was all very sad the one thing I was shocked about was that they successfully pulled off so much humor. Humor in a marvel movie is no surprise, but given how Infinity War ended I really thought this was going to be a dark and dreary movie, and yet it gave me some of the best laughs while still taking itself serious. It's quite a magic act to pull off[換行字元][換行字元]The second act really sets the game plan in motion for how they plan to ""fix"" things and while suspenseful and intriguing it still kept up great and appropriate humor. Obviously humor is a subjective thing and some might bash it. I tend not to like potty humor style but more organic or situational humor, which I thought they just nailed. But at the same time there were some heartache moments that just brought you on the edge of your seat, or made you wipe your eyes. Towards the middle of the movie I was just glued to my seat[換行字元][換行字元]And then there's the third act. OMG... As you would expect it sets up a mega finish as they really are wrapping up the culmination of 11 years and 20+ films worth of story lines and this is what it's all about. The action was great, effects second to none, a bit chaotic at times but that just adds to the intensity. There were moments I just yelled and cheered like I never have at a movie before. I watched it with my daughter who I've taken to or seen every one of the marvel movies with and we were clenching each other through the last 15-20 minutes as it was just so intense, amazing and emotional.[換行字元][換行字元]Coming out of the movie we were both just stunned and in awe, just trying to process the emotions of what we just saw. To bring out so much emotion in us, and from what we saw so many others is just unbelievable. That in itself just tells you how extraordinary this movie was and is a true credit to everyone involved in making this film. All I can say is don't read any spoilers as there are sure to be some now that it's out. Get some tickets, go and see it for yourself, you will not regret it, but again if you've missed any of the movies in between Iron Man and Infinity war, get caught up first."
2714,I haven't watched the movie. It just doesn't deserve 8.7
2715,"The ending of this great saga really reaches deep to tie up loose ends and make the ending a satisfactory, thirst-quenching resolution to what started so long ago-in a small cave somewhere-with a desperate Tony Stark and the birth of a hero."
2716,"In 2008 with Robert Downey Jr Iron man was released, this was when the soon to be called ""the backbone of the MCU"" if Iron man would have failed at Box office or with Viewers, there would be no MCU. Now look where we are, At the final chapter in the ""Infinity saga"" this proves that The MCU has made it! Now Avengers Endgame itself was perfect, it was everything a conclusion should be, It wrapped up every story arc, it had a way to represent memories and old times, not to mention the great visuals and sound editing! I'd say it was a perfect 10 for me, mainly because it wasn't a jumbled up mess, it actually had a focused story!"
2717,"First time in my life, i just want to watch a movie again in cinemas."
2718,"Every time whenever i expect something from Marvel films, they delivered something better . Every Marvel film is better than the previous one(except for Age of Ultron ), After watching Infinity war, Which i liked very much , it raised my expectations on End Game, but i think Marvel failed to beat Infinity War. Infinity war is the best Avengers Movie in my opinion."
2719,"There is a weird glee in watching a movie alone. You start to appreciate the goods and notice the flaws much more easily in a film. Endgame has its flaws. More so than the Infinity war I think. In the infinity war, Thanos was simply an unstoppable force. The sheer desperation to find some way to beat him somehow and still be outmatched by Thanos, in the end, was palpable. Thanos was unwavering; both physically and in the motif - to bring an end to overpopulation. In Endgame, not so much. Thanos only shows physicality and without spoiling it I would say, his motif somehow becomes typically villainous. Thanos is not so much of a ""well-doer of the universe, whatever it takes"" anymore. Another thing is that the Avengers faced quite a less challenge in Endgame, compared to infinity war. Whether it's in procuring a plan to beat him or to execute it, they weren't that much challenged as they were in the previous film. But these things aside, Endgame is a very well rounded film. And boy was it damn enjoyable. Characters were fleshed out really well. The longer screentime really helped in that aspect. All the characters showed heroism and larger than life charisma we expect to see. And the final third of the film was nothing less than spectacular. Endgame is the culmination of 11 years of story-arch. Endgame is the celebration of the end of the Infinity saga. Endgame has achieved something which is really hard to pull off - giving a coherent and satisfying end to the 20 films that came before it. Marvel has succeeded in that aspect and that's where I think DCEU struggles really hard. But Marvel did it flawlessly. Endgame truly is a marvel of a superhero film; and definitely one of the best of MCU; For me, coming in at second place after Captain America Winter Soldier and Civil War. But judging by the hype and rating, is it better than The Dark Knight? NO!!!! Dark Knight still holds the position for the best superhero movie ever made, not even Dark Knight Rises could beat it and Endgame couldn't do it either. MCU and DCEU have the brawn but they don't have the brains of The Dark Knight. But does that make Endgame any less capable? No. Endgame is what Endgame is supposed to be - a heartwarming & proper way to say goodbye to the original Avengers and start a new phase for MCU. And I love it 3000 times <3 #whatever_it_takes"
2720,"After Infinity War I knew it would be hard to top. And I was certainly correct. This movie has little to no action, and relies heavily on a 'blast from the past' mentality. In a movie where half the population has been wiped out, everyone seems to be pretty happy about and make jokes about it all the time."
2721,"Just got back from Endgame here in N.Z and it will make you laugh , cry , clap and be emotionally spent but it's well worth it ! cancel everything this weekend and go and see it . Endgame is the event movie of a life time ! it is superior to Infinity War for sure and Endgame fly's by the 3 hours feel more like 2 it's just that good and I can't wait to see it again plus please go in spoiler free it is so worth it there are so many surprises that were deliberately left out of any trailers ."
2722,"Honestly felt like a completely different film from Avengers Infinity War. In fact the film had such a different tone from all the Marvel films before.[換行字元][換行字元]The characters changed, the story line was poor. Incredibly disappointing end to phase three"
2723,"I though that I couldn't watch so long something without getting bored, Endgame says hold my beer and literally didn't give me any chance to leave my chair even only for one minute"
2724,The star rating doesn't go to 11 and this film deserves it. Ties everything together beautifully. Great acting and a great story. 3 hours zipped by. If marvel movies are your thing you won't be disappointed.
2725,Best conclusion movie and at the same time the best super hero movie of all time! Simply an amazing and unpredictable movie.
2726,"This is the only way this marvelous, compelling, heroic story could end."
2727,"This movie is great great closure to this saga.. Show the present, remembers the past and visualize a little bite of the future"
2728,"So so disappointing... I am speechless, boring, stupid... All i was doing is watching how much is left till the end of the movie..."
2729,"This is what we were waiting for after the devastating loss for the avengers in infinity war, this movie has a lot of heartbreaking, Jaw dropping, funny, heartfelt and epic moments than any other superhero movie. This is worth your money"
2730,Before I saw the movie I was little worried that all the hype gave too much expectations for endgame. My worries were pointless. It is hard to describe how good the movie was. It had all the things what makes a movie great and it was fastest 3 hours ever. Best film I have ever seen. I have always been a huge marvel fan and now I am so proud to say that the movie was everything I wanted and more.
2731,"No Spoiler!! If you haven't yet watched the movie, watch it right away. You want be disappointed. But let me warn you in advance, you ain't ready for this. This is a rollorcoster ride that started in 2008 with Iron Man, and it end right now in 2019.. Everything that happen over the pan of 21 movies before it, unravels and unfolds in such a magnificent way that you can't even imagine.. It is giving me goosebumps even right now.[換行字元][換行字元]You might have heard about people crying and cheering and then again crying and cheering.. Its all true.. You have to experience it for yourself.

That is true as well (obviously not everyone would need it know)[換行字元][換行字元]But, Let me tell you, no matter if you already know the ending, or have got spoilers or have even read the whole story or script, but still all of this doesn't matters. When you will watch the movie and if you know what's going happen you will still me amazed, astonished, and sad by the way it is presented. Every detail, every scene, every dialogue is just as close to perfection as a superhero - fantasy movie can get to..[換行字元][換行字元]Conclusion - it is what it promises to be and then some more.. Satisfied but deeply scared as well..[換行字元][換行字元]Do yourself a favour go and watch this.."
2732,"Insane. Unbelievable. Phenomenal. They pulled it off. The biggest cinematic event in history. What a solid and well deserved conclusion to a 22 film universe. Wow. Really can't explain how somberly epic this movie was. Remarkable. The Russo Brothers have made an extraordinary masterpiece spanning two films that each individually standalone yet mesh together to create a fantastically awesome ending to a saga. A saga built by Stan Lee and carried on through many creative minds in the film industry who have tirelessly work to give the world something new. And boy did they achieve just that. Wow. The pacing made this three hour and fifty-six second blockbuster fly by faster than a snap-okay maybe not that fast. But what incredible editing; the cinematography juxtaposed looked amazing and flowed very smoothly. As daunting as the huge task to make this movie was, the filmmakers took it by the horns and owned it. Outstanding. One to watch over and over again; enjoying newly found one-liners and moments that were not seen before. Discussions will arise, and that's what the best movies always conjure. However far fetched into the future of Marvel movies or the MCU that these audience discussions go, they all have to agree that this was truly a perfect endgame. Heart-warming and grounded; explosive and sensational. This movie literally encompasses it all with an ending to the endgame that will, most definitely, both hold your breath and then take it away, as your jaw drops to the floor. The most iconic, astronomical, epic, glorious, marvelous, a-vengeful third act that will be nearly impossible to ever beat since it is the culmination of over a decade's worth of unparalleled hard work. Avengers: Endgame deserves all the hype and all the soon-to-come broken box office records since it has surpassed all expectations and delivered something unique-which is just about all anyone can ask for from filmmakers. Officially declared as the best this year, so far, yet confidently declared as the biggest monumental event in cinematic history. Loved it three thousand. Wow. -TE (4.25.19)"
2733,Endgame gave several realistic endings to this amazing and ultra fantasizing world. The story lines were so in depth and crazy twisted and concluded in an unimaginable way.
2734,Idk if this deletes the previous review but I'll try.
2735,"Pains me to write this review, towards one of my beloved franchises[換行字元][換行字元]The movie was BORING!!! When writers meet a block, they write about time machines, and really. that is where the movie flops. Before it even left the page to go on film Lets sum up, -1 hour and 30 minutes of recap from previous movie/boring SUPER slow amp up towards for an ending, just to explain the horrid choice of time travel -20 minutes of action/climax, that was mostly a copy n past from earlier movies -30 minutes of SLOW boring ending[換行字元][換行字元]Dont even get me started on Ms. Larson's flat acting, or the fact the Marvel Cannon was ignored.. Guess Capt America is now the God of Lightning? Right.... This is a disgrace to the Marvel franchise Save your time, and money. Dont even rent this"
2736,This movie is very emotional and funny at the same time. We can see how much the characters have developed from the start of the MCU. I'm little dissapointed with the lack of fighting scenes and with the ending. I can say what scenes will make great memes. Thank you Marvel for this great period in my life and for all the great movies u created. Keep going on. P.s. Thanos in that garden reminded me of Shrek.
2737,"First, words cannot describe how i feel. Never watch such a emotion marvel hero movie. Its like roller coaster ride. Story line is truly amazing. Truly worth the money going to the theater watching it. Although i hope to see another sequel, but hey it is a good ending. Anyway total WORTH my time watching it ! Double thumps UP !!"
2738,"The Russo Brothers did an amazing job on this film the action sequences are so good, but the movie is basically 2 hours of comedy and 30 minutes of action, the movie also forgets about the snap and everyone's making jokes again. The ending was really good. The film pays a good tribute to the Characters and their actors.[換行字元][換行字元]It's good but not that good."
2739,Very long and boring ..... frankly disappointed me ... I left with the thought of seeing action as in the first part ... but almost he was sleeping ...
2740,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a behemoth. A cultural phenomenon that has enveloped the minds of audiences everywhere. Since 2008 when 'Iron Man' graced our screens in a small yet metal-bashing blockbuster, we knew something big was happening. Deep down. And now, eleven years later, this fantastical journey of spectacular conflicts and personable characters has come to an almighty conclusion. Generations have been anticipating, for a whole arduous year, how the remaining Avengers were going to stop Thanos post-snap.[換行字元][換行字元]The burning question raised from this extravagant superhero soap opera: Does Endgame sufficiently conclude the franchise? It's an inescapable thought. Endgame was no longer just a film in an elongated series of interconnected stories. It was answers. We needed them, and we needed them executed satisfactorily.[換行字元][換行字元]So, does it? Yes. A resounding yes. My inner fanboy was pleased with the sheer amount of fan service shoved into this epic three hour beast. The third act especially, which we all know is the climactic battle (I believe I'm safe to say that...), is teeming with mesmerising energy as the Russo brothers shove as much glorified content as they possibly can. However, do not mistake my inner child-like demeanour as a critical analysis of the film, for am I not blindsided. It's very easy to succumb to the colossal amount of fan service and forget about the criticisms. I would not do that to you.[換行字元][換行字元]Treating this film as I would any other, I found myself embroiled with many reservations. This is not a perfect film. It is flawed with contrived plot conveniences and a narrative structure that segregates its tones far too excessively, consequently producing inconsistent pacing. Problem is, I am unable to discuss these issues with you. In fact, it's one of those rare films to which I can't really say anything at all, for it may be deemed a spoiler (and I'm not falling down that Asgardian pitfall again...)! Let's try though.[換行字元][換行字元]The first act explored the humanistic drama beneath these heroes. Conflicting emotions as they adjust to the immediate vacuous lives after the events of 'Infinity War'. An interesting direction from the Russo brothers took which injected a dark melancholic aura, cementing the finality of this franchise. Then, the second act kicks in once a particular character is re-introduced. Let's just say I wasn't overly enamoured with the film during the second hour. Intrinsically implementing a barrage of references from previous entries, to the point that it becomes overstuffed and a detriment to the overall arc of the plot. The beautiful development of Thanos from its predecessor seemingly shattered in this instalment, resulting in a simplistic antagonist. And the exaggerated comedy came across as desperate, especially from Thor. Whilst appealing to general audiences and acting as a crowd pleaser, it unfortunately didn't gel with me. I blame 'Ragnarok'.[換行字元][換行字元]Thankfully the third act saves the day, with what I can only describe as a sublime celebration of the cinematic universe. That is what Endgame is all about. Celebration. From the heart wrenching moments (yes, please bring a tissue or twenty) to the chaotic action, the Russo brothers celebrate eleven years of work into three hours. The last hour was entertainment done perfectly, and left me with moist eyes and a smile across my face. Performances were top notch from all cast members, especially Downey Jr., and I had minimal qualms with the visual effects. A few action scenes were edited haphazardly, but just a small nitpick in the technical department.[換行字元][換行字元]So, let me change the initial question. Is Endgame the perfect superhero blockbuster? No. I would go as far as saying I believe 'Infinity War' was better executed and remains the best 'Avengers' film (not to be mistaken with best MCU film). Yet, regardless of my insignificant disappointment for the film itself, Endgame had enormous pressure. It could've simply buckled under the weight. But it didn't. For that, I applaud Marvel Studios and everyone involved. You don't need me to tell you to go and see it, just do it."
2741,"Just amazing. The plot, the dialogs, every choise about the film was extremely correct. The only bad thing is captain marvel, she still sucks."
2742,"This movie absolutely blew me away!! I had very high expectations for this film, and as always, marvel never disappoints. It is definitely a tear jerker and you will laugh as well, probably even more than in Thor Ragnarok, which in my opinion was the most humorous movie the mcu produced. There were a few scenes that I thought weren't necessary and the movie could have definitely gone without, and there were a couple of character development issues I had with one of our favourite heroes, but it was an absolute MARVELous film!"
2743,"This movie is not only star studded but also an emotional roller-coaster. To be honest 4 hours is more appropriate duration for Endgame since every single characters' stories deserve to be told, to be properly explained. With 3 hours, some of our heroes will be underexposed, for sure. Nonetheless, key characters are shining here. Black Widow, especially. Her arc almost brought tears to my eyes.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame's pacing is simple: elevate the adrenaline more and more. First 1/3 of the movie explains what is gonna happen in the movie. The action is really kick in in the next 1/3 and the last 1/3 is A TOTAL SPECTACLE! my heart was pounding in the last battle. I just hope the final battle is longer. Make it 5-10 minutes longer and I think it can challenge LOTR's Helm's Deep for the best battle scene in cinema history.[換行字元][換行字元]This sure is a proper closure for Infinity Saga."
2744,"I'm an Avengers fan but to me, Endgame was the worst part. Infinity war was much better. Even the action scenes are incomparable. Only 4 stars!"
2745,"Undoubtedly this will not get published or heavily downvoted but in the interests of fairness here it is.[換行字元][換行字元]A decent film, certainly not what was expected (the trailer is very, very misleading, which is a good thing in this case) however some characters were basically ruined for the sake of humour or that they couldn't be shoe-horned into the already overflowing roster, also there was in my opinion two kinda inescapably obvious flaws with the story which I won't spoil because honestly, I don't need to, I could hear the people sitting behind me and to my right say ""what? How?"" So I knew it wasn't just me overthinking it. The film is good, don't get me wrong, but it's not a ""10/10 omg I cried and laughed and what a masterpiece"" film that some of these reviews are saying it is.[換行字元][換行字元]It's better than most MCU films, but it's no Winter Soldier or Iron Man by any means."
2746,"Endgame left me on the edge of my seat for the entire 3hours runtime. the third act really blew my mind, this movie will take you on an emotional rollercoaster."
2747,The end of 11 years. It is the best movie ever made. it will break history records. Its gonna make a history.
2748,The fact that Captain Marval a character not really liked among the MCU fans. Came out of nowhere and became one of the strongest Avengers ruined the movie a bit for me. They should have given way more screen time to the 'Original' Avengers but unfortunatly that wasn't the case. This is why this movie isn't a 10/10 and in my opinion worse than Infinity War.
2749,"I just want to say thank to Marvel for an epic 11 years and for an epic conclusion. Thank you Stan Lee, Kevin Feige, Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, RDJ, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, and all the other superheroes for this epic adventure! A job well done!"
2750,"Everything I wanted happened in this movie, through these years I never thought us fans would see anything like this. All props to Marvel Studios especially the one and only Stan Lee who made these characters have an impact on our lives. Excelsior"
2751,The only thing bad about this movie is that it means it's the end of an era for some of our favorite heroes. This movie is an epic conclusion that is emotional and satisfies the MCU
2752,I truly like this movie than before. Their fighting are memorable. 10 points for this amazing movie!!
2753,"Just amazing. To complete a 22 film saga, wow just wow can't do it better then this. My emotions were everywhere. I love you MCU, can't wait for what's next."
2754,"Simplesmente incrível, o culminar de 11 anos perfeito."
2755,I would say that infinity war is better but that's only because this movie was overhyped for me
2756,The title says it all........... A Fitting End to an Amazing Saga. Excelsior!!!!
2757,"There are so many 10/10 ratings on here for this film but frankly it's not that good, the hype was better than the film. Yes it had great moments and I'm not saying it's a bad film because it's not. But it's not the best film the MCU have ever made."
2758,3 hours of too much wasted plot. Instead of introducing deeper on new characters.
2759,"I just don't get it. I tried to like this vacuous American drivel, but just can't. The whole thing is a stupid train wreck of nonsensical characters. hammy acting, loud thuds, baloney quasi-science and space effects. Just act well, have a worthwhile narrative, but no.[換行字元][換行字元]Glinty effect hard on the eye visuals, like you just ate a kilogram of gummy bears, and now nature wants revenge. The acting is the worst, good actors that are aware of the camera and crew, so actually direction fail. Make a some cringe joke to try to distract.[換行字元][換行字元]Just listen to the dialogue: I know, we'll use ether to time travel to go back in time to Asguard on board the muppet ship to get to the Smurf nano-crystals from Dr Oddface. Or something like that.[換行字元][換行字元]Individually a character like Spiderman is fine, but with a Norse God and a talking chipmunk? It's like having a 'bonus' Hawaiian pizza. Not only do you get pineapple but you get chocolate and anchovies because more 'must' simply be better?[換行字元][換行字元]Save it for a long haul flight or download it to your phone so you can watch it when you're on the throne. Well possibly your cell phone game might be more fun. If your IQ is under 70 or you are under 14 you might like it. Avoid the 3D version unless you like migraines and blurred vision, the gimmick that just won't die."
2760,"Initially I was really excited for 3 hours movie, thinking what could have been the story. But to be honest, the story line gave me goosebumps. Endgame is the rollercoaster of happiness, excitement and sorrows. Each and every turn, there is something different. I enjoyed the movie. I enjoyed it to the pieces. Sometimes, tears of happiness and sadness rolled down.[換行字元][換行字元]Can't give spoiler. It's a must watch."
2761,"I have watch endgame 5 times, thanks to A-list. I really enjoy every detail of this movie. To be honest, entire marvel movies more like tv show to me, and this is the season finally, to be accurate far from home is the end of phase 3 but you know what I mean. Don't recommend newbie to watch btw, you will 100% got lost"
2762,"I think End game is non sense How could they destroy the story by missing with time ! killing Thanos erase infinity war so End game is never happen and I wonder about Captain Marvel ..half the univ disappear and she was to busy or did not notice tell she had a missed call ..and once more she come to do nothing here ! come on ! I waited too long for this movie to understand why the ""heroes "" of infinity war give up willingly infinity stone to thanos however the know what he will do! but now never mind it is just a movie no story not a big deal p.s I liked what happen to ironman"
2763,"I have enjoyed almost all of the previous Marvel films - but cannot call myself a superfan (evident by the fact I'm finally watching Endgame after nearly the rest of the world.) But regardless of your emotional investment in the saga - It cannot be denied this a supreme cinematic achievement. In scope and ambition, I can really only compare this with Peter Jackson's ""Return of the King.""[換行字元][換行字元]I really enjoyed the opening act of the film - the tone is like nothing I have ever seen in a superhero film. They made some BOLD choices here. The Avengers did LOSE the ""Infinity War"" and this film allowed the audience to experience that loss in a way I didn't expect. The plot really took it's time - for a 3-hour film it was brilliantly paced, my attention never wavered once. The beginning was more of a human drama / comedy than an OTT action film. These characters are treated as real people outside of their heroic adventures - rare for a film of this genre. They have dealt with the cataclysmic events of the previous film in various ways - they are all changed people.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame deals with themes with surprising clarity and depth - grief, depression, family, regret. They really took some risks when writing this film. Most paid off brilliantly. I absolutely loved Hulk in this film. It's an iconic character, but we have never seen him played in this way - and it was simply perfect. I can't imagine him any other way now - Mark Ruffalo has never been this charismatic. Overall, the jokes mostly landed right - there are more laughs to be found here than in many actual comedy films. I personally found ""Fat Thor"" a bit OTT silly, but Chris Hemsworth made it work. Another stand-out performance within a enormous cast.[換行字元][換行字元]The acting here is genuinely GOOD. Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey, Jr. especially. They have really thrown themselves into these roles and are giving some of their best work. The film was moving, uplifting, funny, exciting, thought-provoking. Everything you could hope for! Yes, there is fan-service also - but all of it feels earned.[換行字元][換行字元]Of course the end of Infinity War had left our heroes at a dead-end which could only be fixed in one way - time travel. When films start messing with time, things can get messy. The stakes can seem lowered and plot holes are near-impossible to avoid. Not so here. The concurrent time plot-lines really work together flawlessly - this is especially impressive considering they had to work around (and compliment) a 20-film decade long saga. I cannot imagine the difficulties they had balancing all these factors when writing the screenplay. I hope this is acknowledged come awards season.[換行字元][換行字元]Most importantly, this was certainly an ENDING for the 'OG' Avengers stars. The film clearly respected this. While still obviously relevant, the newer heroes were allowed to take a backseat. A wise decision - with so many characters and plots to juggle, some had to take centre stage. They chose the right ones. This is even more impressive when compared to another media behemoth coming to an ""end"" now - Game of Thrones. Where GOT has crumbled under it's own weight and expectation - failing miserably. The Avengers have risen to the challenge incredibly. It works on every level.[換行字元][換行字元]One issue I have always had with these ""extended universe"" franchises is that they never seem to have a definitive ending. A small glimpse of continuation must always be given, to carry on the saga. Not here. The felt like the END of something important. And a damn good one! I do not think the film is PERFECT - but in terms of what the film was trying to achieve, I don't think they could have done better! For me, the best film of 2019 - 9/10 *********"
2764,"This is gonna be the bestest MCU MOVIE ever!!! Yes, the climax is super awesome, We can see each and everyone has their part in this movie and oh boy!! Russo bros have made spotlight on all the superheros in the climax fight!!! But the final final made my cry really😫😫😫 #ILoveYou3000 #MissUTony😞😞"
2765,"Saw this with my 2 sons who are huge avenger fans. We left the theater very disappointed. From my perspective this movie was rushed, bad acting and the same as the other. Re-watch the last avenger movie it's the same."
2766,This movie is wrapped up all mcu movies in a very great display. I have watched it more than 24 hours but I can still fell the warm that this movie showed. I will not hesitate to watch it again in a short time. Whatever it takes!
2767,"Avengers endgame is the best mcu movie till date, you will really love this movie and Yes, the movie Is epic"
2768,It's the best way possible to end properly the avengers saga.
2769,Goood and I enjoyed it kdkjhhbsmmkshbsnnsnn jdjdbdheje jdjdbdb
2770,Very bad movie just waste of time and money. in the first two hours of the movie nothing happen.
2771,"I am so lucky to live in NZ where we got to see it on 24 April and I made sure I was at first screening to avoid spoilers. If you are a Marvel fan - I promise I will keep the #Don'tSpoilTheEndGame. This is an emotional rollercoster - you will laugh (we cried of laughter at a few scenes), you will cry (so take tissues), you will hold your breathe, you will be on the edge of your seat and you will pump your fists. 3 hours fly and you will sit through the end credits trying to work out how you feel - emotionally drained but satisfied too I hope. Having watched all other movies in chronological order this month I am amazed at how this pulls all of the unknown as well as known loose strings together. If you are new to Marvel world then you must watch Avengers:Infinity Wars first or this will not make sense."
2772,"How do you conclude a 11-year old saga in a way that doesn't mess things up? It does sound like a near impossible task, but the Russo Brothers have surprisingly accomplished it.[換行字元][換行字元]'Avengers: Endgame', which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbounding and surely an enthralling experience. The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't disappoint. Watching all our favourite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'. I'm damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off. The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. The film has a great balance of humour, emotions and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions. This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It's just perfect. The action sequences were jaw-dropping. The climatic battle left me amazed. It's just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. The humour doesn't look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. The plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. The film features many cameos of characters from the previous MCU films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. The background score gives me goosebumps, though I've listened to it several times. It was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the Hulk. I enjoyed that a lot. But the show-stealer is Robert Downey Jr, who plays the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The man who started it all proves yet again that there's no one else who can perfect his role. Do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle.[換行字元][換行字元]However, there are a few parts that haven't hit the mark. The slow-paced story doesn't have a great impact on the film. The first half is very slow and a bit boring and it could have been better, but the second half just overshadows it with the astonishing moments. Thor had always been good enough in the previous films to grab the attention of the fans, but the filmmakers have ruined him in this film. The character who should have been one of the wisest characters is just shown as the biggest joke of the film. It was really interesting and fun to watch Captain Marvel interact with the Avengers, but had she been given more screen time, it would have been more satisfying. Another disappointing fact is that it's no match to 'Infinity War'.[換行字元][換行字元]'Avengers: Endgame' isn't the best Marvel film. Nor is it a flawless superhero film, but that doesn't change the fact that it's one of the most satisying conclusions ever. 'Endgame' gives the perfect send-off to our favourite superheroes. This is a sheer spectacle full of twists, turns and suprises. At 3 hours, it does feel long, but the stupendous performances and the character interactions make for a fun and an energetic ride. It's the cinematic event of a lifetime, which you cannot afford to miss."
2773,Avengers: Endgame is epic movie with good story and really good visual effects. even though it takes more than three hours to watch It feels like it would have only lasted two hours. this movie is funny in many places but at some points it can also be sad.
2774,It was a good movie it just didn't need to take 3 hour
2775,The movie was good but I think the 9 rating is to high... It was very predictable.. And I believe many other MCU movies had A better story Don't give me wrong it's a great movie and fun to watch.. Just not a 9 er rating And it has many not awnsered questions and things that makes no sense.. Infinity war was much better...
2776,"I am going to keep this short and to the point. This movie will make laugh, cry, and make you feel happiness. The 22nd MCU movie is the best one!"
2777,"As a marvel fan from day 1, this movie gives you everything you could possibly want.[換行字元][換行字元]It is not the usual marvel movie that you see. A true rollercoaster of emotions. Moments that make you laugh, moments that gives you goosebumps and moments that makes you tear up.[換行字元][換行字元]Watching in a sold out show and how it had pin drop silence for the end truly show how the Russo Brothers and Kevin Feige and the Actors nailed this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]It's a must see, I will surely be watching it again. It is truly a deserving end for the 11 years we followed through the 21 movies before it"
2778,"I was waiting for this from the day I watched infinity war and the hype, the wait was completely worth it. The euphoria is real in the theaters. Hard to get tickets for the first weekend.

2780,"For a standalone movie, I give it a 7/10. Sadly, this is not a standalone movie because it just happens to follow up one of the best action movies ever - for that I give it a 3/10 to balance things out, so a total of 5/10.[換行字元][換行字元]What I really don't get, even for people that only think of how to pocket more cash, is why they show such disrespect for their customers from whom they expect recurring revenues. I mean Marvel and in general franchise movies totally count on coming back viewers, so the previous movie literally pays the next.[換行字元][換行字元]In Endgame's case they spent $400 million expecting to gross $2 (at least) billion, and they felt sorry for the few dollars more they would have spent to hire a decent writer to come up with a decent script - the single thing that pushed Infinity War to break away from the pack. That's a cheap attitude, which will eventually backfire.[換行字元][換行字元]Where to start?[換行字元][換行字元]The story is a disconnected, incoherent mess. Think of Infinity War script? Well think of the exact opposite for Endgame. There is absolutely no story connection whatsoever and it clearly shows in the way the actors perform on screen. The confidence everyone had in Infinity War simply is not here; it's like they don't really get what they are up to.[換行字元][換行字元]The humor that flows naturally through to discharge the intense moments in Infinity War is tried to be copied here, only in a bad manner. I don't want to spoil things, but having Cap commenting on his butt, I mean, come on people..[換行字元][換行字元]Time travel? Seriously? That was the best you could come up with to get over it? What a brilliant, original idea! Only a couple of hundred other movies and TV series have already thought of that, only to come up with a messy mindjob, regardless. Putting RDJ mumbling mumbo-jumbo quantum stuff to explain how time travel works (btw quantum mechanics has absolutely nothing to do with time in general), just left everybody in awe of what the heck he is talking about. Having watched the trailers, and the theories that crawled through the Internet, I was ready to go there and watch that, but somehow I was hoping otherwise - that was an absolute letdown, especially the way it was delivered.[換行字元][換行字元]Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans managed to save some of it in their own way - nothing spectacular though. Others like Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo were totally crashed under the burden of the ridiculous script. As for the rest of the crew, well, ok, let's get paid and get outta here..[換行字元][換行字元]Thanos, the more complex character of all, and the one that made Infinity War a success, appeared here just like all the other villains before him - think of Loki and Ultron and you get the idea of what Thanos has been reduced here to.[換行字元][換行字元]All in all, Infinity War was truly hard to match and for that it made Endgame truly hard to watch. Infinity War, for its own reasons, set the bar really high. We have seen that coming in other sequels as well. What comes in mind as an example is The Matrix followed by Matrix Reloaded; the kind of standout movie that is plagued by its own successor.[換行字元][換行字元]Infinity War followed by Endgame is not an exception. Many of us already knew that before walking into the theater. Sad to say though, Endgame eventually turned out as another example of what you get if you only do it for the money."
2781,"I know the hype around this movie, so I'm not going to give any plot points away. I will say, however, that it really is emotional, exciting, and awe-inspiring. I went in knowing very little (that's the way to go, by the way) and it really paid off, as a lot of the plot decisions were surprising and bold.[換行字元][換行字元]It has its problems, and without giving away too much, I thought that some feminist themes that were far too overt and frustrating were desperately forced in there. But in all, it's hard to complain about Endgame, because it really is one of the craziest things Hollywood has ever achieved."

2783,"I just love how the people hate it when the Youtube rewind comes out, and swallow the same agenda in a Marvel outfit. The whole plot is non existent, spiked with some fanboy pleasing absurdity and the compulsory fake sciense which doesn't make sense at all. The main contradiction is in the overall mood of the movie. In one second they emphasize how terrible everything is, then next minute they come up with at best a nose exhaling joke. The only good thing was that Captain Marvel barely appears on screen. Huge missed opportunity of adding a Fortnite dance to the end of the great brawl, would have fit the spirit of the whole movie."

2786,I highly recommend to watch this incredible superhero movie. It was amazing and had an incredible ending.
2787,"I have to say that Endgame was enjoyable, albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons, yet this is to be expected when all the MCU is combined into this strange conclusion. The performances are very good, although one is left wondering what the point of introducing Captain Marvel was due to her lack of actual contribution to ""the grand plan"". I firmly believe that this could have been done better by postponing its release or splitting it into more parts so that the pacing, the tone and at times even the story wouldn't be so all over the place. However, I am glad to have seen the conclusion of the franchise and hopefully Marvel will continue to deliver great movies in the future."
2788,Can't stop crying. Epic ride with A6. Eleven years. Perfect ending for them.
2789,"An amazing film, that gave everything a true mcu fan wanted, an emotional rollercoaster that had everyone in the cinema crying at one time or another. people who gave this film a 1 star are mentally challenged trolls who should never step foot in a movie theatre again."
2790,"I'll start by saying that the last battle is the best battle in the whole Marvel universe. It starts like an hour before the movie ends. The first two hours has some boring parts, but they are relevant. It is a great movie, top 2-3"
2791,Only 1 word for this movie. WOW. This is so spectacular and great movie.
2792,"I would rate 9.5 but decided to round up to 10. Great end to an era. I thought I was ready for this movie, but I definitely was not. There is so much that the trailers did not even hint at the came to pass in the movie. Great action sequences, great dramatic scenes, great movie. Couple scenes feel forced or unnecessary but it does not affect the final feel of the movie. Considering the massive world the MCU has created, this movie is a great ending. I pray and hope that Marvel will be able to live up to the expectations for future movies that this movie has created a high bar for."

2794,This movie is an amazing way of seeing all the heroes in action.
2795,"To be honest, after infinity war i didn't think they could match it, but they managed to match it and i might even say surpass it. I'm a little late to the party but once i got the chance i went and can honestly say 3 hours flew by and i came out feeling emotional and wanting to talk to everybody about it which to me means the film was spot on. The end battle was absolutely epic but would recommend in 2d as in 3d it was very hard to catch everything going on. I will most definitely be returning to watch again."
2796,"The plot hole bothers me so much, and the last year is better than this one"
2797,The story was terrible. The dialogue was terrible. Character development was forced. The end battle was impossible to keep up with. This movie does NOT live up to the hype.
2798,"Easily best movie made by marvel, it was funny, sad, entertaining and just all round the best"
2799,I live Marvel .I love Superheroes.I love MCU and I loved Infinity War.The way I left the hall after I watched Infinity and The way I left the hall AFTER watching Endgane was completely different.So much hype and well deserved too but the ending was just not satisfactory at all.I liked bits of it but the other bit I just forced myself to like it just because I've been a fan of the creators and the actors and the characters for so long.But no It was not what I wanted not what we deserved.
2800,"Like every Marvel movies it has future'past experiences. Infinity war seemed more like a prequel. The perfect mixture of Avengers 1,2 and 3. And trailer says it all. ""Endgame"" as the name says it has a great ending. Thank you for the memories RDJ"
2801,"Oh my, these guys have done beautifully. I've never been so happy after a superhero movie, like ever. If you thought Infinitty War was awesome, wait until Endgame takes you to infinitty and beyond. Direction is flalwless, there is no part where you feel like ""waiting"". The screenplay has done a very nice job solving many question, although is not perfect. In any way you want to see it, The Avengers Endgame does not dissapoint, and it will be recalled as the best finale ever made for a saga, for many years to come"
2802,"Great movie but not perfect. I will say that ALL the actors took their roles seriously and no one just mailed in a performance. Story was excellent but somewhat predictable which actually it had to be to please the huge audience. We knew going in that there would be some slow spots in the beginning and scenes that would have us grabbing for the tissues just to set us up for all the adrenaline pumping action they could squeeze into 3 hours of film.[換行字元][換行字元]That said, they should have had some pull to cut down on the half hour of previews before the 3 hour marathon even got underway.[換行字元][換行字元]But the biggest flaw was not using that post-credits time to give us a quick retrospective of Stan Lee. Just a quick replay of his spots in some of the previous movies and a big THANK YOU STAN would have been sufficient and would have kept a few more people in their seats to watch the credits."
2803,"This movie was a collection of some past marvel sequels.(Avengers,Captain America,Thor,Guardians of the Galaxy)There are some scenes where you will say OMG,if it wasn't you are not a marvel fan.I am not going to post spoilers but remember doctor strange saw a one in a million posibility before he gave up the time stone to save ""Tony Stark"" in Infinity War.You would understand the reason in Endgame."
2804,"I have to say, like everybody else, I was so hype for this and I'm not disappointed! I think this movie is the nicest way to conclude the « Infinity Saga » and to respect every detail of it.[換行字元][換行字元]I like that they brought a touch of psychology for theses characters who were grieving and for those who died or go at the end.[換行字元][換行字元]For me, it's the proof that heroe movies can be more than some fight, but to bring true friendship and empowerment!"
2805,I liked this and the action it was so much action and I like the captain America part
2806,"Just incredible. Perfect combination of funny, sad, exciting, suspenseful and thrilling"
2807,"Bravo. Bravo! Somehow, one of the most hyped movies of this time has exceeded my (and many others') expectation. This movie leaves a beautiful bowtie on top of the gift that was the MCU. Unlike many other superhero universes, the MCU primarily focuses on character development over the abilities or powers of the heroes. This movie is no different. The first time I watched this movie, I was on the edge of my seat, crying, laughing, cheering, and throwing my hands in the air. No other movie has ever brought about this level of emotional response in me. Somehow, I was crying even harder the second time I watched it even though I already knew what happens...."
2808,"I hope everyone appreciates this movie for the piece of art it is. Everything that has happened in the MCU (22 movies) mattered. This movie blended all of the storylines into one arc beautifully. It has a perfect blend of drama and well timed comedic moments. Every character has a chance to shine and the cast delivered at every chance. It has a perfect ending. Of course the Disney/marvel machine will roll on. They are printing money at this point. But let's all take a while and appreciate the work of the entire team that made this happen for fans. I grew up wondering if I'd ever see this material on a big screen. I feel like a kid watching these movies and I'll always love them for that.[換行字元][換行字元]So please, avoid the spoilers and see this for yourself. Enjoy it now and forever."
2809,"The complexity and dozens of meaningless characters thrown in to the sequel was unnecessary and a mess to keep up with. In this conclusion we see our favourite main characters again and some slight twists with a decent ending. The CGI and acting great as usual, however some of the scenes are irritating in their convenience. I.e. captain America taking too much of the spotlight considering his powers."
2810,This movie is the greatest movie i had ever watched marvel end of era just shock us very emotional and joyful. i am the greatest fan of Robert Downey Jr. i cried a lot dont forget to take your handkerchief with you.
2811,"This is the first marvel movie that actually dives into a world where the heroes have to face the consequences of their failure and you feel the weight of it , the Russo brothers have delivered a finally that is fan service entertainment and beyond epic"
2812,This and Interstellar are the only 2 movies to make me just sit and think what I saw houra after it ended. Absolutely incredible.
2813,"Been waiting for so long for the ending of the saga and now i'm really satisfied with it. Honestly i've been scared it will be a mediocre ending or even worse. But after i watch it, it is really great. For me, it's the greatest ending that has ever been made. It concludes everything in the infinity war and also the journey of the original six cast. It's also perfectly make the transition to the all the mcu character successor. I think no more review so i dont spoil anything. If you enjoy watching mcu movies, you're gonna love it."
2814,Perfect movie can't away anything from it.. Expect the time traveling things was a bit too much
2815,"Some really good hype moments here and there but the movie plays out like expected. It's sadly very far from Infinity War quality, 7/10."
2816,This film will go down in history as one of the greatest.
2817,Only one word to describe it. Legendary. Best Film ever made. Best direction. And be prepare to good bye a friend we grow up with.
2818,"This is my first time ever writing down a review but I just have to say that the movie left me speechless. It was a rollercoaster of emotions from the very beginning. The directors did a really great job. Although it was 3 hours long, but you don't feel as if the movie was that long. I wished that I could write down more but I don't want to give out any spoilers. All that I can say is that it was definitely the end of an era."

2820,"Great movie to bring your girl/mom to watch: she will love it, she will cry and laugh a lot as the plot is full or emotional/soap opera and cheesy jokes Main mistake would be to watch it on IMAX - I regret that - I just assumed this was a great movie to watch on IMAX/laser but it looks awful on the big screen: closeups are not terrible but I guess it may look OK only on small screens - it seems it was filmed with a dash camera! Watching it 3D would be another mistake I guess So don't expect much of this one on a big screen and just go for a cheap ticket, even youtube would do if you just want to watch it Regarding the plot - pretty sure it was written by an old lady, it has a lot of emotional soap opera stories - was this supposed to be that? action scenes are like written by someone that never watched any action movie As an action movie is just average, after 2 hours of soap opera finally some action that is a mix of whatever, the bad guy is not even scary or bad Most characters appear to be like constipated, depressed or on drugs, like if the bad guy (Thanos) erased 50% of their coolness Special effects are just average as well, but at least there is some fight, nothing worth high resolution screen anyway If you loved Thor: Ragnarok this is the movie for you but if you are after an intense action movie - don't expect much of this one Again, this is a great movie to bring your girl - she will love it"
2821,"Not only me but, All people around the world like this Film because it's an end of an era since been started from the First MCU movie IRON MAN and I've been watched almost of the 22 movie and I have gonna to say I love All but, I can't describe this Movie in one word because, This is Incredible and Amazing Movie I've ever seen truly my best MCU Movie ever and really have gonna to say I really recommend if you are or not Marvel all I have to say is Run into the theater and watch this Film cause it's Awesome and I promise you will never be disappointed cause this is an End of the Saga and you will be absolutely emotional I really Like and I want to watch it again because Is truly excellent so Let's enjoy the movie and have fun Thank you!"
2822,"Congrats! the first place of box offices ever! to be honest, I saw twice. I felt nothing comparing to the others in the first place. and then, I felt better during the 2nd. it's outstanding truly! it told me everything I wanted to know, and gave me wise answers why they chose."
2823,"Its an amazing movie to watch. Everything is so grand. Directors binded every piece amazingly well. There's right amount of humour and seriousness and its just blend so well. Cudos to Marvel team!! A must must watch to every marvel fan and those who are not in marvel can watch for its amazing action ,humour, grand scale cinematography and What not. In short a must watch for every one!"
2824,They should include the X-Men in their next movie.
2825,There are so many nonsense point in this movie. Wasted my 3hrs. I'm very very DISAPPOINTED.
2826,"An emotional roller-coaster ride filled with the loudest of cheers, the most thunderous of claps and the worst of the tears rolling down my cheeks ! My throat was literally paining with all of the cheering & my eyes were red, yup, that's how much I cried !!

2827,Not sure about the rave reviews. But was a huge let down. It felt as if they just wanted to end the series . Infinity war could have been a better ending. Lot of flaws on time travel theory as well.
2828,Avengers end game was a satisfying and fulfilling experience. I rate it a solid 9/10 but it was not as surprising or shocking as infinity war and didn't fill my heart with poison like infinity war did
2829,"I didn't think anything could top what Infinity war did whatsoever and so my expectations for this where minimal, but holy hell did Marvel top it. This movie is by far the most emotional superhero film ever, every character is broken after the events of the snap and we see them in a state of complete emptiness, luckily this films 3 hour run-time helps create more depth to these characters with the final act being a culmination of everything in the MCU, it is a comic book fan's wet dream and the ending is to die for."
2830,This movie did everything great. There were some brilliant moments where I got Return Of The King vibes and I was pumped out of my mind. They really surprised me with how they chose to play this one out and all I can say is the Russos pulled it off amazingly. Also the soundtrack was incredible with a spectacular final act.
2831,"What a crying shame that a movie that had so many people awaiting its arrival delivered so little. And, it seemed to take forever to deliver that![換行字元][換行字元]I believe that this is one of the most critical reviews I have ever given and believe me, I firmly believe that it is wholly because my expectations were set so high by the franchise that it was pretty much doomed unless it was mind blowingly good.[換行字元][換行字元]If the story had had one thread of; 'that was believable' or even an odd; 'that could work' it may have been able to recover but, it doesn't. It doesn't even have a; 'that was cool' at any point either![換行字元][換行字元]It's actually so boring I had finally found a movie I could replenish concessions during and didn't feel like I had missed anything. The reality is that I probably missed some really critical parts but it didn't matter, the movie had lost me long since then.[換行字元][換行字元]The entire story was so convoluted that it was just plain terrible. The basic thread was non existent and I agree with many other reviewers that certain characters were pointless.[換行字元][換行字元]Synopsis: Infinity wars was mediocre, this isn't. Also, personally, it has done so much harm to the franchise, I for one won't be bothering to spend the 'sizeable' costs involved in cinema excursions for any Avenger related future offering again."
2832,"Avengers: Endgame is simply the best movie ever created in the entire cinematic history. Best. If there is any word stronger than that, I would have no hesitation in using it. Everything about it can only be rivalled by very few movies. People will be talking about this movie tomorrow, the day after, next month, next year, in 10 years, in 100 years as the best thing humankind has ever made. We have made history here today and we will not stop until we are satisfied."
2833,"It doesn't matter if superhero movies are your thing, you're going to want to see this one, an amazing epilogue of the most successful cinematic universe ever created! 10/10!"
2834,"Absolutely incredible. Not a single thing was out of place. Stunning sequences, style and environment. Hats of the russo brothers for making a masterpiece. This movie will be remembered forever. #avengersforever 😍"

2836,The Best movie I ever seen in my life I thank Marvell for presenting this masterpiece
2837,Avengers Endgame has the potential ability to break Avatar record. A movie like this comes once a generation if you are lucky..... Best superhero movie ever...
2838,"Lets review The ENDGAME! Mind will say it all.. buggy , cud hv done this, first one was better , plot holes.. but here give yourselves chance to feel.. witness.. this epic saga comng to an satisfactory, nostalgic end. also even a day long movie couldn't be enough to conclude this 10 year long journey of 21 movies.. Book your tickets now! After all this zenith deserves a farewell too!"
2839,"This will go down as one of the greatest comic book films in history. It's a true blockbuster achievement. The reason I love the MCU is not because of action, it's not because of the visuals, it's because of the characters. I love these characters and truly relate to some of them on a deep personal level. I saw Iron Man when I was 11 years old and Downey Jr's portrayal of Tony Stark has literally been a part of my childhood since that movie. And Marvel has done a really wonderful job building these characters and crafting their stories because this movie was a phenomenal ending. Sure it hasn't always been perfect but I really don't see how you could have ended it any better with the way they crafted their story. It all felt right and made sense. The 3 hours never stalled for me because I was just really invested in what everyone was feeling and thinking. Call me a baby but I teared up every 10 minutes because of a piece of dialogue or emotion a character delivered because it was so in line with what they've been through. By the end, I was bawling even when the credits were still rolling. On a more critical side of things this movie won't be something you can pick up any day and watch on video. Infinity War definitely benefits more from the action and pacing side of things and it's a lot easier to watch because of how fast everything moves. But this is required so much emotional investment that when you throw it on then you know you gotta clear your schedule. There's so much movie in this movie it's hard to really just sit down and not get up during it. There's no room for bathroom breaks unless you really don't care that much lol. So will everyone love this? No. But if you put alot of time and investment into these characters and these movies, and you care about their struggles and the things they've been through, you'll find some emotional pay off in this movie I promise. Cap is my favorite Avenger and I was completely satisfied with his arc in these movies. Much like Infinity War this movie is an experience and one you'll remember hopefully. I'm seeing this again as soon as possible and I would just like to thank Marvel for being a home for my childhood at the movies. I love Star Wars but I never got to experience the original trilogy in theaters. That movie magic and impact was displayed for me in the MCU. This was my Star Wars. Thank you Marvel thank you. 10/10."
2840,Everyone must watch It is one of the best movie of this decade Vfx is ultimate
2841,"Made an iMDB account just to leave this perfect review, a touching finally to a story told over 22 films over 10 years! With an emotional ending and the best movie End!"
2842,"Watched all 22 movies in a row, and it came to the perfect end. Doesn't disappoint."
2843,"Simply watch the film and you'll understand the ""WOAH! WOAH! WOAH!""."
2844,"I feel like this movie really closed the franchise nicely. It's always hard to end an era, but this was a brilliant culmination of the buildup created throughout 20+ movies. Solidly concluded."
2845,I've never cried for so long at such ridiculous s***.
2846,Never did i expect Endgame to be this good. Everybody must see it. There are many unexpected things happen throughout the film!!
2847,This movie is fun. Nerding out about the massive 23 film undertaking is fun. The storyline is fun. The character evolutions are fun.[換行字元][換行字元]End Game is an amazing addition to an already epic collection of movies. Duck the haterz 🦆
2848,"Avengers: Endgame is a culmination of 11 years of cinematic superhero movies that have entertained us on different levels all throughout the years. 22 movies come to an explosive ending here and if the word 'epic' ever had any meaning, this movie would be it. Truly a visceral experience that leaves you heartbroken and shocked from all the events and the insane number of characters and story-lines that they intervene. I loved pretty much everything about this movie, it was indeed a bit slow at the start but I didn't mind as the ending is probably the most spectacular thing I have ever experienced in a cinema. Everyone does an amazing job at acting, but my stand out would be Jeremy Renner who truly shines as Hawkeye. The Russo brothers have accomplished an incredible feat and the entire 181 minutes of this film, serve as minutes that will go down in the history of cinema for decades to come."
2849,"I actually saw Avengers: Endgame the first day itself and lost my voice for a week, but I'm reviewing it now because I've seen it today in 3D 4DX, the best version of a 3D movie having talking rats and purple giants. And about the movie, it is 3 hours of satisfying nods and callbacks to our beloved MCU movies, and every second of every MCU movie has built up to this excruciatingly awesome, epic, gargantuan conclusion which is worth every bit of hype. I'm not gonna say anything about the story because, believe me, you don't wanna know it. And Robert Downey Jr. deserves the Oscar for the best actor. The directors and the screenwriters have done a splendid job giving the most satisfying conclusions to Tony Stark's and Steve Rogers' character arcs. Special shoutout to Alan Silvestri for his electrifying and goosebump-inducing music, I almost had a cardiac arrest with his music. This movie is the best of the best movies, the very best. Thank you, Marvel. Thank you, the Russo brothers, Thank you Stan Lee, and Thank you, Robert Downey Jr. for entertaining us for these 11 years. We and the universe will surely miss Tony and Steve. We love you 3,000, Marvel! Thanks!"

2853,"Amazing movie to watch seriously, with a amazing story im always a fan of marvel studios movies"
2854,"4 days later and I'm still trying to process everything I saw and felt, I have lived MCU from day one and I can honestly say this film was beautifully perfect for me. I'm not going to nit pick at little tiny things when as a whole Endgame is a film that both exceeded my expectations and left a mark on me that will last a life time. I want to thank everyone involved, 11 years of joy that helped me through some pretty rough times. Thank you Avengers."
2855,"Come on people. Why is every Marvel movie so overrated? I rate them as what they deserve. Infinity War was pretty much the only outstanding movie in the franchise. They did something what noone dared before. That was a very good movie.[換行字元][換行字元]This one? 7 at best. How on Earth can anyone just a little bit of brain rate this higher over movies Inception, Matrix, Goodfellas, etc almost the whole top250 movies. Are you mad?

Sick of seeing every trash being in the top250 because of little fan boys that haven't even seen sh**."
2856,"Man. This movie was so freaking great that oh man, i have already watched it two times and planning to watch 2 or 3 times more lol or even more XD. But damn, legit movie. Character arcs, infinity saga, and all the other story lines are just so amazing. The movie is 3 hours but didnt feel like three hours. Whats even more funny is that when i watched the movie first time, i was HYPEEEEED. But when i watched the second time, i was even more HYPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED. I dont know, but i got even more hyped, this has never happened to me when watching a movie. Loved the first hour, second hour was so amazing, but oh man oh man, the third hour was the best comic book moment ever. Man, just nailed it. Kudos to all the people involved with this project. I highly recommend you guys watching this movie or even giving it a shot. 9/10 (this is my highest rated comic book movie XD). BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER. PERIOD EVER."
2857,I loved every second of the movie. Plot was amazing and there could never be a perfect ending on what they did in this movie. Kudos to Marvel Studios!
2858,Just watched avengers endgame for the second time (still watching the credits) and the first 2/3 made so much more sense!! Been about 6 weeks since I last seen it and I loved it then too! (More so the fight scenes but now I've gotten much more clarity on those marvel Easter eggs!! Very well executed and very smartly orchestrated too!!
2859,"It's the next day after I've seen Endgame and I still don't quite know what to make of it. So I'll mention the downsides first: 1) Infinity War was a mess, there was just too much thrown at you without making much sense; to expect the audience to recall all the ins and outs of Infinity War was asking a little much; 2) they do some real interesting things here, particularly time travel, but don't overthink (or even partially think) the real complications or it will ruin it for you; 3) some of the stuff that happens either doesn't make sense or runs counter to earlier Avenger movies, and 4) the raccoon from Guardians shouldn't have had a major role. Plus a bonus complaint, how they treated Thor was stupid. On the plus side: 1) the sheer weight of the movie is spectacular, with a few exceptions the CGI doesn't get in the way of the story; 2) the logistics of the plot allows some of our favorite characters to do something magical, deserving and sometimes quite unexpected; 3) the work by nearly all of the main actors is quite good. So to recap the Avengers book: 1 was the best superhero movie ever; 2 was a disappointing bust; 3 had too much to work with but some of it was good stuff; and 4 was enjoyable with some moderate reservations."
2860,It was really amazing! Definitely one of the best marvel movies!! Worth watching!!
2861,"Absolutely littered with plot holes, this the last Jedi of this franchise. Don't let the nostalgic factor blind you from the poor writing."
2862,"And that's the best part of the movie ... I had my doubts about the Russo brothers, but now I know. Stop making movies, please ..."
2863,"Endgame is absolutely the most touching and with most emotional elements among those 22 movies. And you can see the character's personal spiritual growth in these three hours. People who are brave, arrogant or selfish, they all become differently. All in all, it is the most significant moment in MCU. AND DON'T FORGET TO BRING TISSUE PAPER, you properly will cry if you have been follow all these 22 movies in this decade."
2864,"First of all, I have to agree on the comments that first half of this movie is really slow. There is only 10 minutes of action throughout entire 1,5 hours. However, it doesn't bore you, instead it helps you focus on characters and their feelings after they lost their friends and families because of Thanos.[換行字元][換行字元]Remaining Avengers members try to figure out a way to undo what Thanos did. Although most of us guessed what they were gonna do, the way they do it has a lot more to offer than you can imagine. That's where things starts to refer to almost every previous Marvel movies. It makes you laugh, surprise and cry.[換行字元][換行字元]You don't have to be a pure Marvel fan to enjoy it. Don't want to spoil it, just go and see it."
2865,"If you are in your 20s, well, you might love this movie. If you are in your 30s like me, god I can´t even begin on how much of a disapointment this movie is. At least MCU is over now. No need for us that started this back in Iron man in our early 20s to keep up with all the non stop movies shoved at us.[換行字元][換行字元]GL next generation, hope you enjoy the new Universe. Because after this, I am done."
2866,"As an avid MCU Films fan, the Avengers: Endgame was by far THE BEST MCU FILM. For 10 years MCU has always delivered blockbuster movies and Endgame felt like their BIG BANG or LAST HURRAH; a trophy for all the 20 MCU films we have seen and loved.[換行字元][換行字元]Sitting through a 3-hour film never felt this quick but it was not short of satisfaction. It gave me all the feels, from laughs, to tears, to being in awe, to surprises.[換行字元][換行字元]However, I wouldn't recommend watching this without watching all the MCU Films before this.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers: Endgame is WORTH THE HYPE. This is the finale that will stay with us."
2867,"First of all the movie was great. There is absolutely no doubt about that. I agree that time travel was tricky and difficult to understand. But people comparing this with infinity war are just too dumb. It was a brilliant effort landing something like this, it took a lot of patience and genius to pull this off. But some people are over smart trying to notice all those little plot holes neglecting the overall satisfaction it gave to the Audience. It was pure fangasm and it could not have been better. People only like infinity war more because it has too many battle scenes."
2868,"I hope The whole world get to watch it, its a Game Changer Not Alike Any Ever Done"
2869,"I appreciate many desperate people want to seem ""edgy"" or ""alternative"" by defining themselves as ""different"" but really, you come off as nothing more than the representation of inadequacy. I'm not suggesting you need to love this movie or that you can't find fault, but what this and it's predecessor, Infinity War, achieved; not only in cinema, but storytelling as a whole, is laudable. This is not a stand-alone movie and requires some foreknowledge, but it's an accomplished endgame of a movie arc of over 10 years unlike any other in movie history"
2870,This is perfection. Never have I ever felt so many different immense feelings watching a movie. I am stunned. Best movie ever. Love it 3000. Thank you. Thank you for making this! THANK YOU!
2871,"Haters will hate. We do love those characters no matter how good or bad the movie is. I don't think it is a ten star movie either; however, it is undeniably a great example of an epic movie."
2872,Just magnificently the best part is that I can do it for a bit of time to get a copy of your website on the whole thing about ww2 you can you take it down loooool you are you gonna come to your mum is the most beautiful sound of the day after day and I don't think I'm going on with my family in the area of interest to you and I know they have fresh air you have
2873,The movie was released on the basis epic. The movie u see is really fantastic and u could not even imagine what's coming . Even though certain part could make you cry but the stund and the acting is so perfect. And the movie is now full of curiosity to the MCU fan's
2874,"I really really enjoyed this movie. At first I asked myself do I want to sit through a 3 hour movie...? The answer was yes and boy am I happy with the results. The moment the movie started I was hooked. The pace of the movie started off slow and picked up as the film went on. Even during the slow moments I didn't want to move and miss anything. You can really tell when actors, Directors and everyone else who works on the production of a film put in their maximum efforts. This was one of those movies. This was very well made and I cannot wait to see what is next for marvel."
2875,I loved this movie and the story line was such a good one full of emotions and excitement. I feel so sorry that it's the end.
2876,"Endgame is everything a grand finale should be. It's an epic drama that takes place in different time periods, involves multiple plot lines from other films, and neatly, and (believably) wraps up many unresolved issues. At 3hrs in length, there are occasional slow spots, but this is forgivable given the emotional depth of the subject matter here. (I wouldn't take young kids with short attention spans.) As expected, however... It also holds you in suspense, excites, and even makes you laugh, though not quite as often as previous Marvel outings... This one leans toward the dramatic. Rest assured, you'll leave satisfied, and maybe teary-eyed... Easily the best of the bunch, and obviously a labor of love for all involved. (Reviewer is 50)"
2877,About as bad as it gets - even worse than Captain Marvel and I thought that was bad[換行字元][換行字元]save your money give this a mess a miss
2878,"I'll keep this short and spoiler free.[換行字元][換行字元]Simply, it doesn't compare in story, performances, characters, structure, or even excitement to Infinity War. Infinity War far surpassed expectations on all fronts where unfortunately Endgame comes short.[換行字元][換行字元]It's a fun movie and there's great and powerful moments. But ultimately there wasn't nearly enough suspense, and the plot was far too messy and borderline lazy.[換行字元][換行字元]It was a good movie but I'm sad to say a disappointment in regards to what came before and in regards to the place it holds now in the history of the MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]If you're just looking for a fun movie and are willing to ignore major plot holes, lazy story elements, and lacklustre character choices hopefully you can enjoy it for what it is. But it's no Infinity War; and although it has redeeming elements (which on their own could've been part of a great film) it's overall a disappointment. Lower your expectations. I hope you like it better than I did."
2879,I'm no reviewer of films but just my two cents! That was amazing! It was the perfect way to end a 22 film cycle that will never be done again and that is why it gets a 10 from me.
2880,"A must watch movie ,it has everything in it comedy,emotions ,superb special effects, action and very good background score.I enjoyed it all the 3 hours"
2881,The movie keeps you attached to it from the very start. So many unexpected scenes and massive respect for the entire crew. Great movie.
2882,All am saying is go and see it you will be amazed oscar nod in my opinion wow wow wow wow
2883,"I had to see this one in Spanish since I'm an American living in Spain. After the near flawless Infinity War, it would be hard for this one to live up to its predecessor, and the expectations are high. I would hate to be the one responsible for this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]The first hour is really slow. In fact, I didn't even know where this movie was even going after the first twenty minutes. But then in the second hour, it's almost an homage to all the Marvel movies that came before it with a lot of fan service thrown in. A lot goes on, and it may even require someone with knowledge of all the Marvel movies to get it. The third hour is the final battle and its really good and emotional. I even teared up in a couple parts and I couldn't even make out what they were saying.[換行字元][換行字元]However, there are some questionable things that happen in the movie like what happens to Hulk and Thor. I would like to say that they didn't screw up on Captain Marvel. They handled her well. I guess we are going into Phase four, but the only one I'm interested in is the next Guardians of the Galaxy. I'm not sure if I'm sticking around after this one. Then again, Marvel has been genius when it comes to these films."
2884,Good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good
2885,All i wanted from marvel thank you to all cast of endgame you're my true heros ♥
2886,"Well, the magnificent saga ends with a such great and satisfying conclusion which gives you the best cinematic experience of your life. Unexpected, brilliant and an all together masterpiece."
2887,Man what a let down after Infinity War. Virtually no action in a superhero movie. Predictable plot with lame time warping around all over the place. And what in God's name did you do with Thor's character after the last movie holy crap! So glad I didn't waste my time in a theater for this one.
2888,Standard story with happy end with a lot of tearful and stupid dialogs. A battle till about 10-15 mins from 3 hours.
2889,"After all the hype and build up for this I was expecting a little more than a romantic end to the MCU's most beloved franchise. Plot holes, character development and all around story really made the experience less than memorable. In the people that loved it or disliked it that I've talked to I feel like a 50/50 split is what I'm hearing although after enjoying the previous marvel films. I do not know if the people who rated it so high just feel an obligation to themselves to say they loved it so in their heart they weren't let down or that they did truly enjoy this giant mess of a movie. Take the popularity out of the franchise I think if this was released at the beginning of the MCU the rest wouldn't have done as well. That's my 2 cents."
2890,"I expected a lot from this final chapter. Unfortunately I think Infinity War was better. Endgame is good but unbalanced and a lot to digest in 3 hours. Many twists, plots and a lot of characters, especially at the end. For sure it is emotional, funny and good effects, but some parts should have either been exploited more or left out. The thing that bothered me the most was that some characters' powers were not balanced compared to the other movies. But for the rest of them, you will love their development until this moment. Overall it's a must-see movie, but to make sense for everybody go and see the rest of MCU first, starting with Iron Man."
2891,"This film make you cry if you fan of MCU.I pay tribute to the brothers, the directors."
2892,"Love this movie gonna watch again and again till satified. As Chris Evans said ""i laughed, i cried, then laughed again"". I literally felt humble after the movie, i even stayed till the last credit lines."
2893,Just do one thing......[換行字元][換行字元]Go watch it in the theatres.
2894,"Couldn't have asked for more from this perfect ending to a truly epic run of movies.[換行字元][換行字元]Very sad to see it come to an end after 10 years of absolute blockbusters but they've successfully delivered a satisfying, heartfelt conclusion.[換行字元][換行字元]Bring on the next phase!"
2895,A worthy conclusion to 11 years of movies. A definite must see movie.
2896,I must say when I sat down to watch Endgame I was expecting something else. This movie totally went left an once that plot was unraveled I literally feared for the hero's because Thanos isn't just any enemy. He's brutal. Couldn't have asked for a better ending to the infinity wars. Loved it
2897,Greatness been here since day one what a journey. Love every second of it rollercoaster of emotions #dontspoilendgame!!!!
2898,"Very long,boring,I give 1 star to make balance because every rate it 10 for nothing"
2899,"No spoilers!![換行字元][換行字元]Being a sceptic of Marvel movies for a long time, I had low expectations going into Endgame. I didn't love Infinity War, but I wanted to see this film opening weekend to avoid spoilers and see how the 10-year culmination of the MCU concluded. Well, I was pleasantly surprised with the film. It's not without its issues, but Endgame felt like one of the most unique and captivating Marvel films to date. I was very surprised at how easily I was engaged throughout the 3-hour runtime. The film breaks down into three parts, each part having its pros and cons. Personally, I thought the first act was the weakest and overstayed its welcome. Despite that, there were still some interesting parts that helped flesh out the aftermath of Infinity War. The second and third act felt very original and had many surprising moments that kept me guessing what would happen next. However, there were parts that felt VERY fan servicey. Of course, some of the fan service was fine, but at other points it felt like a little much.[換行字元][換行字元]One of the great things about this movie was that it broke from the simple MCU formula. It has a much different story than any of the other MCU films and utilizes much different plot mechanisms to make it feel more original. The emotional range of the film was another thing that felt different to me compared to many other MCU films. I thought the humor in this film was handled much better, causing me to laugh multiple times. Not only was the film funny at points, but it also had some sad, depressing, exciting, and thrilling sequences. This film, unlike some other MCU films, was able to have some very serious moments and did not have to cut the emotional tension by inserting a cheesy one-liner.[換行字元][換行字元]Despite it being a much more original and emotionally driven film compared to other MCU films, it did have some shortcomings. I think that some of the fan service took me out of the film because it felt either overdramatic or forced. There were times were I caught myself rolling my eyes at how overdramatic or socially 'woke' the movie was being. One scene in particular felt like a blatant advertisement in the middle of the film, which was jarring and cringe worthy. There were also many moments of the film that could have been explained to help bring more tension, but instead were brushed over in order to fit everything into a reasonably lengthed film. I think there were parts that should have been cut or shorted and other parts that should have been extended. Lastly, I thought that Thanos was misused in this film. I was excited to see his role in this film but was left disappointed by his role as the villain.[換行字元][換行字元]As someone who wouldn't consider themselves a Marvel fan, I had fun watching this movie regardless of it having some issues. I would definitely recommend it if you have been following the MCU at all recently, but I probably don't need to do that because everyone and there mother is going to see this. Overall, I thought it was enjoyable and quite possibly my favorite Marvel film.[換行字元][換行字元]P.S. It feels satisfying to have this chapter of superhero movies come to a close. I hope that it will make way for more innovative and interesting films, whether they are superhero related or not."
2900,Loved every minute of it. Never seen a movie living up to the hype so well.
2901,"As the title states. The climax of this film is the most important part. Something the whole previous 2 and a half hours builds up to. To have it spoiled by an all powerful character, who can just swoop in and destroy whole spaceships, takes away all the suspense and hence, in my opinion, all the fun.[換行字元][換行字元]There is a reason even superheroes are flawed. Even they struggle and fail. It's to allow us to identify with them.[換行字元][換行字元]I loved Infinity War, but this I will not see again."
2902,"You and I couldn't have asked for more. The Russo brothers did the most incredible job making this movie possible. There were moments where you cry, moments that'll bring the tears out of any person watching. It was stellar and shattering at the same time.. 3 hours don't feel like that long when you're watching the movie of a lifetime. Ever actor got a considerable screen time. And then moments of Iron Man, Captain America and Thor will just leave you open mouthed. An emotional rollercoaster! An angelic experience for MCU fans! The best thing is, keeping the theories aside, that this movie is not at all predictable. And that it has everything in store for you. Once again, you couldn't have asked more. And I'm officially in love with Captain Marvel !!!"
2903,Complete feminists movie. Several male hero characters were belittled and turned into abysmal failures. Waste of time and money.
2904,"I've seen almost all of them, But I don't like every one, I'm the standard marvel black!"
2905,"Scoring this movie less than a 10 does it no justice as it couldn't have been written or acted in every other way. Credit to everyone involved, I was blown away in every scene leading up to its final climax. They mixed in laughs with thrill after thrill to gripping parts. I preordered this movie on ITunes before I left the theater. What am 11 yrs of movies and it's the perfect movie to sum it all up."
2906,"Really, people think this is like 8.9?[換行字元][換行字元]This means i am really getting old. I love Infitinty war and i went to the theater like super-hyped. During the movie i wanted to like everything, then when it was over I thought, man it was bad. I am sad, how is this possible?[換行字元][換行字元]I am ok that this is being bad. But why people think it is ~8-9? it is a good 6 max 7, but noooo..."
2907,It was Amazing and everything I wanted it to be if you are a big fan you are going to love this one
2908,"Very happy how this played out, sooooooo satisfying.everything comes together perfect. The 3 hours isn't enough, neeeeeed more."
2909,"What can I say but ""Thank you, Marvel""?[換行字元][換行字元]I really recommend you to watch all MCU movies before Endgame, because they make this experience unique for the fans that is with them since the beginning.[換行字元][換行字元]About the movie, I'm thinking for a long time to write an adjective, but the only one I can think for now is ""wordless"".[換行字元][換行字元]I had never seem something like this, even in Infinity War (which I thought it was insurmountable) we didn't watch such a deep and emotional movie like I just watched in Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]All characters have a great end in the film. I can say that them fulfilled the role just the way it should be. We don't see individual throughts, but a team working together to save what they love more.[換行字元][換行字元]It was a pleasure to be part of this, because all of us has something in these Marvel movies. Maybe grateful is the word to discribe the feeling right now. I claped my hands when the screen turns black and I know that a lot of fans, like me, did the same![換行字元][換行字元]Thank you, Marvel for the Gran Finale."
2910,"Avengers:Endgame lacks the pace that infinity war had and some defining moments and storylines may seem a bit stretched. But with stunning visuals, staggering emotions, incredible acts and a satisfying end makes it something to be experienced."
2911,"Pretty much 90% of the user reviews already say what I want to say so I'll keep it short. This movie was so much worse, in every way, than Infinity War. Which is a shame and it's not gonna get a low score because of how overrated it is, even though most people leave reviews saying how much they hated it. It just sucks that THIS is the ending to the decade long series we all grew up with."
2912,This film was done so well. The 3rd act I will say in my lifetime will never happen again. This movie brings all the feelings inside to life 10 fold. I love this movie
2913,This was the most exciting and satisfing film from MCU.
2914,"If you like special effects then you will like this movie. If you like a good, intriguing, believable story with interesting characters then this movie may be very lacking in that department. The characters with all their interesting super powers just seemed to be a bore. Perhaps this sort of thing happens when you have too many main characters in one movie. There is no character development. One thing there is no shortage of is good looking special effects but it merely covers up the inadequacy of any kind of substance in the story lines and characters.[換行字元][換行字元]The story totally contradicts itself. I'm not going to post spoilers in this review but in the end it really looked like the writers just made up unrealistic stuff that did not make any sense or had any sort of believable realism. If you tell a story like a 3 year old, other 3 year olds are going to love your story but adults are going to be bored to tears.[換行字元][換行字元]They turned almighty Thor into a 3 year old, with mannerisms, intellect and all the traits 3 year olds display. But here we go again with Hollywood trying to emasculate men in all their latest block busters. Political nonsense that seems to be infecting and infesting big budget movies... It really just makes the world of Hollywood look all the more plastic.[換行字元][換行字元]Perhaps the extremely high rating of this movie made me expect something really good and entertaining but all the enthusiasm I had soon turned in boredom and mild resentment because 3 hours is a lot to spend on something that seemed to bring only boredom."
2915,"I liked the movie however I think they kinda made the pace really slow, the first Infinity had way more action.[換行字元][換行字元]Either way It had an epic ending for our heroes and I think they did a great job with that."
2916,"Avengers: Endgame is now officially the highest grossing movie of all-time, but does it live up to they hype? The film does have everything you'd expect from a Marvel film, including a great cast, amazing special effects, shocking moments, incredible action, and of course humor. To the lay person, I supposed it could be considered a perfect film, but to me, a person who has dedicated themselves to Science Fiction, I saw some pretty big plots holes, (I won't discuss them here as I don't give spoilers in my reviews, but we can talk about them at length in the comments section). In order to counteract the actions of Thanos (Josh Brolin) in the previous film, the remaining Avengers need to try all kinds of things, and they try a literal smorgasbord of Science Fiction classics from time travel to alternate universes. While these make for great story telling, there is a format to them and universal rules but this film ignores all of those. I wouldn't say that takes much away from a truly fantastic story, but it's something that bothered me. What I have always loved about the Avengers is the ability to take all these huge stars and larger than live characters and put them into one film, without overdoing it. Everyone has their place and it's always a perfect fit. No one is the star of the film, but no one is ignored either, it's just something that is so rarely done and almost never works out quite this well. As for the nearly three hour running time, the film is so well paced that you don't even notice it. The Bottom Line is that a lot of series try to overdo it for the big finally and end up falling flat (shout out to Game of Thrones). This is not the case with the Avengers as they really did save the best for last."
2917,"Don't enter the theatre with preconceived notions of what you wanted them do do with this movie, no. Instead let it unfold as Infinity Wars did, an unexpected storm. This movie was epic, the acting, the cinematography, the story, the mixture and combinations of joy, pai, and suspense...all the years of a finally woven Marvel heroic tapestry. Finished. But in a way that leaves me yearning for more, but relishing the memories of the characters I once simply read about as a child from the 60s to seeing them in the big screen like never before. Man this was a great movie! A must see. Hollywood Oscar folks time to stop overlooking these cinematic treasures. There were some Oscar worthy performances in here. Phase was of the age of marvelous Marvel heroes hit it crescendo. And it was one for the ages!"
2918,"Wow, just wow... I mean, what can I say. If you've watched the movie you know what I mean... Speechless🤤"
2919,I like all those magic tricks out of from theirs hands and good teams against bad teams.
2920,"This movie is outstanding. Has action, comedy and story all well written and delivered. It also nicely links the previous mcu movies together. A must see this movie."
2921,"To begin with, it was a good film, decent acting, great effects, a lot of funny parts where whole cinema laughts, but to get a 9/10 or even higher rating movie must have much much better than that, so probably only comics fan boys can rate it higher. The truth is that movie was too long, last hour or at least half hour of the movie was a waste of time, its sci fi, not documentary movie, we dont need to see how they live happy ever after, also despite good fulfillment, you have to say that scenario is what, time machine scenario is the easiest one to extract more money, but the movie leaves the feeling that it is not the true ending. Also the biggest lie is that someone wants to watch it second or third time, even when watching the first one, last hour you question yourself when it will finnish."
2922,"If I hadn't grown up in the silver age of Marvel, if I hadn't worshipped the stories Stan wrote and the pictures Jack drew, if these iconic characters hadn't been modernised for a new generation with shorter attention spans and a need for 'comic' interludes, I'd have scored this higher. It's good. But I hate the lame humour and the modern take. Having said that, I enjoyed the film."
2923,"Had me on the edge of my seat for most of the film, absolutely outstanding, fully deserves every top rating."
2924,Its a perfect way to combine all 21 movies and have such a mind blowing end after all its been a long journey and people who have been watching for years would be enjoying each and every bit of it Hats off to the MARVEL for producing such a wonderful movie which is as crazy and and as heartbreaking at the same time #MARVEL
2925,"I have never given a 10/10 to a superhero film since the first Avengers film wayyy back in 2012. This movie is not perfect obviously (1. Some jokes fell flat and some of it i felt just appeared at the wrong time 2. Some songs i felt were placed or played at the wrong time too 3. Some people might have a problem with the pacing of the first act but i personally loved the slow pace), but this movie doesnt need to be perfect and there are obviously better superhero films in terms of quality like Captain America: Civil War, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Logan, The Dark Knight and so on but come on man. Those movies are great movies but Avengers: Endgame is magic/one-of-a-lifetime-event![換行字元][換行字元]Never have i once laughed, cried, cheered and screamed this much in a movie. I have also never thought i could get this much of a rewarding experience from rewatching all 21 MCU films. WOW! Thank you Marvel Studios for this experience![換行字元][換行字元]See it without any spoilers, i beg you!"
2926,"Compared to Infinity War, which was a roller coaster of emotions, Endgame is a more climbing the mountain. It starts slow and begins building to its great third act. In between not much action happens, but delivers in what Marvel movies do best, character moments. You go to watch a Marvel movie just to see how the character grows or interacts with another of your favorites, and this movie is full of them. Also, it provides closure to 4/6 original Avengers, and doing it wonderfully, not an easy task. For me, it was a pleasure from start to finish, maybe in my viewings the first half does drags a little, but besides that a great film."
2927,It is the perfect end to 10 years of amazing film making!
2928,"Objectively it's a decent movie. But as someone who was simply BLOWN away by Infinity War. This movie just left me plain confused. There are so many giant plot holes. The script seems rushed. Not well planned out. And maybe the term ""snooze fest"" is a bit harsh. But the movie builds up really slow. Only to reach a point that is very predictable. For me, just too bad for it's potential."
2929,"Absolutely, amazingly cast and astonishing!!! It all makes sense, fantastic ending !!"
2930,"With a perfect respect to both death and life, Endgame lived up to the definition of closure. The intricate plot takes you through laughter and tears, joy and grief, anticipation and thrill. The cast and the crew did an incredible job in pulling off the task set before them."
2931,"An amazing movie, emotional, funny and with so much action! One of my favourite movies! It is worth watching! You will see the best actors of Marvel and the best of the best is Robert Downey Jr. in all the parts of avengers series . It's priceless !!!"
2932,All bias aside this movie is incredible and will change your life if you let it. 100% every question is answered and you will feel emotions that will shake you to the core. Incredibly well done and was truly a spiritual experience I mean that
2933,"It wasn't what we expected it to be. The whole thing, the effects, the whole plot, the way the writer and the director put everything they had into this film was what kept 90% of the audience at the edge of their seat. We cried. We cried a lot. So many feelings. We felt overwhelmed and couldn't help but cry our eyes out. No matter who you are, where you live or what you like, please, don't spoil this film. #dontspoiltheendgame"
2934,"What an end to an epic series. A roller coaster of action, humour and emotions."
2935,"Next Level, Keep it up. amazing team, n amezing all roto artist"
2936,"The plot start a little bit slow, but it's worth to wait for it. There are some twists whose are predictable, but the movie hold us suprises as well. It's perfectly mixing the drama and the jokes, whose works together. It is a monumental ending of a monumental movie period. Great work from all the cast and the makers."
2937,I've watched lots of movies but this one deserves an oscar. Great scenario great actors everything is great about it. Thank you for letting us be a part of this movie!!
2938,"WOW! This movie is FANTASTIC in every single regard. I won't spoil anything because I'm not gonna be that guy, but WOW just take my word for it. EVERYTHING about this movie is done right! Thea cting is psot on. The effects are groundbreaking. The story is the one of the most clever stories I've ever seen. The action scenes will go down as one of the best action scenes of all time, FACT. The directing was perfect. The writing was perfect. Just...everything was perfect! Thanos is one of the best film villains in cinematic history! Josh Brolin will get a nomination for best supporting actor at this year's Oscars. I'm betting money on it! Robert Downey Jr may also get a nomination too. Is it feminine of me to say I cried a little bit during multiple parts of this movie? I'm not a liberal and I don't cry easily but WOW, this movie actually pulled at my strings a little bit and I give it mad respect for it! I genuinely think this film will be the one to win best picture at the Oscars in 2020. It will at the very least get a Best Picture nomination with other nominations in best screenplay, directing, actor, supporting actor, and every technical film nomintation like sound and effects. These movies are basically the Call Of Duty of films...they just get better and better, and we never wanna see them stop! GO SEE IT."
2939,"Sure, this movie might have some things that don't add up but the genre is fantasy/sci-fi, which means that not everything has to make sense and apply to reality. In my opinion, this movie perfectly concludes the series. The first half might feel slow at times but it is necessary for seeing how the characters and the world were affected after Infinity War. The second half makes up for this by a totally epic conclusion to the series. Please watch the movie!"
2940,Really great movie so far. Overall it's a complete entertainment package. Just one disappointment is the role of Thor. He is a great warrior and using him like a comedian is worst. Although my favourite avenger is Cap who had good moment in the movie yet I feel really bad for Thor. Hoping that in future he will return as he was in Ragnarock.
2941,"I don't know why this film is getting one out of tens. I've seen films that are far worse than infinity war and the have scored nines and tens, have you people no sense of taste? Anyway for me I enjoyed this film, I will agree it's not perfect but the pace of the story, the final battle scene and some of the characters stories concluding it tied up the infinity saga well. There were some great comedy moments as well as some emotional fair wells. It didn't feel like three hours as it was entertaining, don't watch with all the hype watch with an open mind as a marvel fan and you will enjoy this film."
2942,I don't wanna spoil it... Just like to say that RDJ I LOVE YOU and the whole crew infinte...
2943,"This truly was worth every second of the wait. Heartbreaking, brilliant, triumphant, every emotion possible hit me at different points in the film. The chemistry between the actors was amazing as always. Almost 3 hours and it felt like 5 minutes. Its 2 days since i seen it and 8 still feel like ive been hit with a brick. Spectacular end to a fantastic set of movies. Heartbroken that its over."
2944,"Hulk downgraded, Thor downgraded, Thor's ending was too bad Ironman downgraded, Thanos downgraded.. Not satisfied with this movie.. it has many flaws, good for a fan."
2945,"If you managed to go see this movie without getting it spoiled, congratulations. This movie contains references from previous movies that die hard, and maybe casual, MCU fans can recognize. However, you do not have to see every Marvel movie to still enjoy this 3 hour grand finale. This movie still maintains the perfect concoction of humor and realistically good computer generated images (CGI). If you are going in expecting a fluent continuation of ""Infinity War"" then you are correct."
2946,"Everyone shines in this movie. Directed to the fans of these 10 last years of Marvel movies. A thank you, beautiful, tragic, fun. The emotion stills my words just after seeing the movie. Have to see it twice again to do it justice."
2947,I give you a 6 for thanos. The little that comes out takes the film.
2948,A visually spectacular train wreck[換行字元][換行字元]Visually stunning with some action scenes with some of the worst writing ever (actually there is no writing here) and dialogue since the last Hallmark movie. So disrespectful to the viewer and the comic books and the fans. A bloated hollow commercial project by the Disney sith.
2949,"There is more to story than action scenes. The movie was great, not as good as Infinity War but not terrible as people are making out. I understand the critisism but people rating below a 5 are clearly fan based blind."
2950,"It's the best movie ever,I have never seen any movie better than this one"
2951,"This is the best action movie i have seen in my life at no point of it's 3 HOUR runtime was I not interested and at times where the fight scenes were happening I was really pumped and my arm was unironically shacking from all of enjoyment i was having, I remeber laughing alot too at the very funny jokes in the movie."
2952,First of all I am a crazy cinephile and a Marvel Fanboy and for past 2 years I was quite disappointed with MCU for not giving character value to any of the recent 2 to 3 films before Infinty War. But my God!!!! Oh my God!!! I have to say MARVEL YOU ARE GOD !!!!![換行字元][換行字元]This movie will strike people's heart like Thors lightning. I won't spoiled the film but I will say it has given each character such amount of value that you will feel instantly connected to each of the heroes. RUSSO BROTHERS got this right ! - CHARACTER VALUE is everything!!!![換行字元][換行字元]Last time if I have cried during a Marvel Film was when Harry dies in Spider Man 3 and Gwen Stacy dies in The Amazing Spider Man 2. I've been melancholy for a month after those 2 film and I never thought I would cry after a Marvel Film but MY GOD !!!! I have to say ... I am gonna take a hell lot of time to move on after watching this film. And boy !! Captain America was the best farewell scene after Logan.[換行字元][換行字元]I would like to congratulate all the people in Pre-Visualisation team for such amazing efforts in the Visual Department. Visually the film was absolutely STUNNING !!!!! Also I would like to congratulate the writers and directors for pulling off this film with a proper end to SAGA 1 - The Infinity Saga.[換行字元][換行字元]Last but not the least ... I wish Sir Stan were here to see this ABSOLUTE GOD LIKE MASTERPIECE !!!! Go watch this film NOWWWW!!!!!
2953,"This was a awesome movie and i will be purchasing it as soon as it comes out I laughed, cried ( not afraid to let people know) and cheered I don't want to spoil anything so I hope everyone liked it as much as I did"
2954,"Natalie Portman is my focus; first of all she's not really even in this movie (or any other movie); The thing about Natalie Portman is that she is so f-ing hot that she could be uttering the most embarrassing lines ever written, and look like a deer in the headlights, but you are still engrossed with her look; those brown eyes and angelic figure leaves most people with the intrigue of: ""Who is this piece -and why am I enamored with her? The simple answer: She is constructed of a little bit of ""that thing"" from all walks of female life. In other words, she is stunningly beautiful and comes across as extremely bright-which she is! Portman is rare, and keeps a low profile. This also adds to her mystery and creates more and more intrigue on her part."
2955,Man oh man what a movie ! cant believe im alive to witness this i cant say much cause that would spoil the movie if i did all im gonna say is that everyone is in a for a roller coaster of emotions and just plain epicness! You will be mindblown it's indescribable how good this movie is !!!!!
2956,A review will never give this film and series enough justification. Watch the film and make up your own mind.
2957,"I'm not a super huge Marvel/Avenger fan, but have enjoyed these lighthearted movies that require minimal investment to be entertaining. Infinity War upped the stakes and this movie didn't quite live up to the surprise ending of it's predecessor. However, the action is great, jeff bridges is great, their are some funny moments and the movie delivers what its supposed to. I dont' think this movie is meant to generate new Marvel fans, but it does what it's supposed to. Overall I'd put it on par with just about every other Marvel movie in terms of story telling, with a significant upgrade in terms of epicness."
2958,"This is a kitchen sink movie, in that you get everything but the kitchen sink in it! The three hours flies by mostly due to the fact that the action rarely stops. It's a movie filled with laughs and tears and goodbyes. A couple of scenes seemed shoe horned in to appease the folks clamoring for more ""Woke"" moments. Those scenes aside, most of this epic movie is solidly put together and wonderfully presented. Without spoiling anything, I was scratching my head at some of the logic behind science in the movie that goes against every thing any movie viewer has ever seen, but I have a policy of throwing logic to the wind on super hero movies. What's the point when you have people flying and teleporting across space. I've read this movie is a love letter to fans of the MCU. I'd agree with that, and would add that if it was a love letter, Robert Downey Jr. signature would be at the end, in the center, and slightly larger than anyone else."
2959,"I'm not a huge Marvel fan, so I don't know if I'm missing anything, but it was decent.[換行字元][換行字元]But, it was far too long and I struggled to sit through the last 45 minutes or so. If they cut out all the filler, it would've only been 2 hours long, not 3. I also didn't like how the scriptwriters and filmmakers couldn't really work out if they wanted the movie to be serious, emotional and epic, or filled with a hundred funny but silly jokes to pad the run-time.[換行字元][換行字元]Regardless, I still enjoyed it. The plot was good, the jokes were funny, the CGI was good, and the soundtrack was decent. It was definitely better than Captain Marvel."
2960,10 stars because it almost made me cry (when i say almost I really mean almost because I do not cry)
2961,"I'm not sure what the fascination is with people who desire to be so 'edgy' that they can shave their face with their bare hands...but looking at some of the 1/10 reviews here, it's a common fascination.[換行字元][換行字元]Some have fixated on 'plot holes' as a result of the time travel elements of the movie...its TIME TRAVEL. It's literally impossible to make a movie containing that topic and not be left with questions, since you can always interpret cause and effect/paradox elements of a time travel movie.[換行字元][換行字元]This film is actually peak marvel perfection. I review a film on how well it keeps me enthralled by asking myself how many times I thought about having a cigarette during a movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Now I rarely actually leave for one but if I'm thinking about it, im not fully engrossed.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame made me forget I even smoked for its entire 3hr runtime (the added runtime making it even more challenging to acchieve). I cant possibly rate higher.[換行字元][換行字元]When I finally got outside I would describe the cigarette I had as less the feeding of a habit; and more as post coital.[換行字元][換行字元]Even as the darker film of the franchise they still bring some humor and avoid going full 'DC Dark'; and you still genuinely root for the characters, terrified for their possible fates.[換行字元][換行字元]The third act is nothing short of absolutely epic and my advice would be to be mindful of your surroundings...as the person next to you is at risk of damage on the several occasions where you can (and will) punch the air.[換行字元][換行字元]And if you dont have tears in your eyes towards the end, then you are the person the snap deserved to get.[換行字元][換行字元]The Russo's have done it again. You pair of geniuses!!!"
2962,"My first review! I felt I had to write it, to thank Marvel, the superb actors,characters, writers , everyone who was behind this amazing 11 years, thanking for this amazing journey The movie was/ is flawless as all from Marvel until now In the theatre today lots were laughing, gasping, crying and now like everyone I can wait to see what will be next with joy and sadness in my heart! Thank You"
2963,"I had a huge disappointment with this movie. I can't share the excitement for this Avengers movie. Sooo much hype and soo much people where excited to see this movie. The Cinema was sold out. But to be really honest it's just simply not worthy to be a Avengers movie. Really flat story and just disappointment how the characters evolved. Sadly that people just will see the ""good comments"" and ignore that this was one of the most disappointing movie ever...."
2964,"Excellent hype for non Marvel fans, the plot just develops too slowly for those who have actually been following the entire sage. Flat performances by all actors, Antman being the stand out this time around. Expected a huge gripping finale but was presented with an overly confident view on everything and no suspense whatsoever. Chuckled a coupe of times but couldn't wait to leave the cinema. Will wait for the next Installment....."
2965,100/100 you will literally don't want to blink so you can watch every single second
2966,Just a basic superhero movie. 3 hours but not much going on.
2967,"Theres no other way to describe it without spoiling it... it's just satisfying[換行字元][換行字元]I'd be perfectly happy if the entire MCU ended right here[換行字元][換行字元]Its not as emotional as infinity war. To me at least. I did have tears in m eyes but that's as far as I got[換行字元][換行字元]Well done marvel eitherway[換行字元][換行字元]And Brie Larson? Barely in it. Self centred, selfish and rude. All things that is the character in the comics. As well as real life. She's in it for about 20 minutes"
2968,"This movie delivers in all aspects I can think of, action, comedy and heart. It is a great ending that lives up to your expectations! It is as good if not better than Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]9/10 from me"
2969,I WOULD JUST SAY THAT PEOPLE GIVING LESS THEN 10 STARS TO THIS MOVIE ARE TOTAL IDIOTS. MARK MY WORDS YOU ARE NOT GONNA GET A MOVIE BETTER THEN THIS. THIS WAS A MASTERPIECE. (THERE IS NO PLOT HOLE AND MOVIE IS WELL BALANCED)
2970,"What the.... did Disney do? I know the wannabe cinema fan will be like ""that was a well deserved ending""... Like how? The story does not add up.. Really does not make sense... The solution to try save everyone is like xmen day of the future past concept ""reset button""[換行字元][換行字元]The actors really Marvell this shows that Disney is loosing it with there political agenda? All the scenes she was in felt like a reshoot.. Like they had no plans for Marvell and it was forced! Thor... What a.... shame[換行字元][換行字元]Where are the times that you could actually expect spectacular scene action worthy moment.... Instead of a.... comedy show full of meme!!![換行字元][換行字元]We are not a generation who are brain dead yet!! I wiil stick to the comics and leave the cinema to the real fans!"
2971,What more can I say? Simply the best Super Heroes movie ever made..
2972,"Avengers: Endgame is excellent, for a movie that had to be so much The Russo's did a really great job of doing so and giving the main characters the proper send off along with delivering a great end to the MCU's chapter for these beloved heroes. The heart of the movie is Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, their characters in the movie and their conclusion were all perfect. There aren't even words to describe how Spectacular it is, it's not only the best Marvel movie to this day, but quite possibly the best superhero movie ever. This is a movie that gave me everything I wanted and more. It's even worth mentioning how conclusive and satisfying this movie is, in the middle of the humor and exiting action scenes, at its core it's and incredibly touching and emotional story of redemption. It's definitely a movie where so much effort, care, and love was put into, almost as Marvel's love letter to every Marvel fan. I was invested in this movie the second it started. It's a touching, very well written, fun, and extremely well made movie. It's such a wonderful movie that's so well made."
2973,"Amazing, best film yet to bring all 21 previous films to a conclusion! And brie larsons horrible acting was cut super short!!!!! Seriously though it was an emotional rollercoaster with laughs, gasps, cheers, and tears. Must see best way to conclude a series."
2974,"I was actually lost for words for a while. This film just gave so much details to all unanswered questions. I've been a MCU fan for as long as I can remember, whether it was the comics growing up or the tv shows. I know some people think that the adaptation was not accurate and true to the comics, but I personally 100% enjoyed the film and thought the culmination of all 22 movies to this point were absolutely brilliant. There was emotion and heartbreak, love and hate and all the action that was needed to enforce itself into one of the greatest films of our time (I know it will be argued, but I believe it is).[換行字元][換行字元]The film has everything that I was expecting and more. Some scenes resonate on different levels and leaves you reeling. Others leave you in awe and happiness.[換行字元][換行字元]This is truly one of the most iconic films I have ever seen and will re-watch over and over again.[換行字元][換行字元]Even though the film is 3 hours long not one minute was noticed as I was so intrigued.[換行字元][換行字元]I would 10/10 recommend watching this to anyone who will listen and believe 9/10 times they will be satisfied.[換行字元][換行字元]A true Marvel (pun intended)."
2975,It's not over for cap and ironman. With hulk rebuilt the time machine they can go back in time for them all they need is more of pimms formula. Let's continue the franchise for the fans.
2976,"Just try to imagine someone who didn't watch the 22 previous Avengers movies, watching this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]It's just totally incomprehensible.[換行字元][換行字元]And even for someone (like me) who watched the previous movies, how can I remember all the details after 11 years ?[換行字元][換行字元]Too many characters and too much talkings, this movie is BORING ! A pile of private jokes doesn't make a good movie.[換行字元][換行字元]I give 3 stars for the last 20 minutes. Just for the SFX, but I don't understand who fighting who and why."
2977,"A spectacular conclusion to the first three phases of the MCU. A ton of action and emotion makes this one of the best Superhero movies anyone will ever watch. While it is easy to get sidetracked by the hype around this movie there are plot holes that will make you scratch your head. Personally this movie is one of the best cinematic experiences ever. I laughed, I cried and I clapped."
2978,"Avengers endgame is what 21 movies led up too and I promise I that this movie blew expectations no surprise if that but also made our 10 year journey a thrill ride I thank u marvel u made us connect with these heroes along the ride from the very begging ( Iron man 2008) to this masterpiece . this movie had everything us fans wanted and way more kudos to the Russo brothers u both have done an outstanding job I literally love u guys because u both knew what we wanted . this movie was a 100/100 no lie this movie will stick in our hearts forever and again I thank u marvel . this movie had it all joy,sadness,excitement , great super hero moments , dark, light there was absolutely nothing wrong here no surprise to that aswell. All in all I can finish up by saying thank u avengers for everything this movie shocked the he'll out of me and I couldn't help but to cry tears of joy when the end credits rolled on I cried not once or twice but four times this was truly the perfect conclusion and aswell as a new beginning"
2979,You don't need any review to watch this one buddy. 😂😂😂
2980,"Just wow. I have watched every Marvel movie from the very beginning, and after I literally bawled through the end of Infinity War, I couldn't wait to see how this amazing saga would end in Endgame. And it certainly didn't disappoint. I absolutely LOVED the movie. It had many hilarious moments, great CGI, and some really heartbreaking and heartwarming moments which literally brought me to tears. A true credit to the creators of this film and the actors too. If you haven't yet seen it, ENJOY."
2981,"A masterful epic that not only concludes the past 10 years, but also sets up the future of the MCU. Avengers Endgame delivered an outstanding and creative story while still adding meaningful conclusions and new beginning to our favorite characters. 9/10"
2982,So why the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? I can explain this to you: Think of a film. This is such a film that makes you cry and laugh as well as a strong villain like Thanos.
2983,"Except the unexpected. Expect tears, laughter, sorrow, pride and joy. It was amazing. Im still trying to recoup myself."
2984,"I don't have words to describe the amount of emotions this movie gave me, I never cry during a movie, yet this movie managed to have me crying not once, not twice, but THRICE during it's ending, I'm really sad knowing we won't see Avengers again, but it is what it is, good things in life are supposed to end at some point. To all the MCU, I LOVE YOU 3000. Thank you."
2985,"The perfect movie for ending the jorney after 21 movie, all leading to this."
2986,The Infinity War was 10 times better. The end game is just way to long and boring
2987,"Last 30 minutes was overly sentimental, however, there were some scenes that made me have goose bumps. It was not what I expected."
2988,Don't spoil the endgame Just never Best superhero movie ever made
2989,"This was the perfect send off to what has been an amazing journey. I laughed, I cried, and I don't know how they managed so much in three hours. The film didn't let up at all and was worth the lack of sleep before work tomorrow (midnight screening and 9am start)."
2990,"The past 21 films that have been produced by Marvel Studios as a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have all culminated with the granddaddy of them all, Avengers: Endgame. This movie brought together everything that Marvel fanatics would have hoped for, flashbacks, emotional ties in and of course a great ending to what Kevin Feige called The Infinity Saga. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo did a miraculous job bringing everything together, the movie stars, send offs, and directing. This was all possible with the help of screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely deep understanding of what this movie meant to the MCU. The way that the screenwriters and directors worked together to play with our different emotions is what sets this Marvel film in a different class from the others.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie begins directly after the ending of Avengers: Infinity War. We see how Thanos' (Josh Brolin) snap affected each character in a different way. The different uses of lighting by directors Joe and Anthony Russo help set the mood for each scene differently.[換行字元][換行字元]The Russo brothers have done things similar to this in their other Marvel films. When the team is down in the dumps they tend to be in darker locations, like when in Captain America: Winter Soldier, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) went to talk to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) in a dark cave following the collapse of SHIELD. Each actor will use a softer tones to show how they have been knocked down both mentally and emotionally.[換行字元][換行字元]The best example of how the Russo brothers did this in Avengers: Endgame was when Natasha Romanoff went to find Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) who had become a vigilante following the snap. The scene is set at night in a dark rainy alley which represented not only how Clint is dealing with the world post snap but also how the entire universe is dealing with it.[換行字元][換行字元]Another reason this film was such a success was the use angles during each fight scene. We see how those who are currently winning the battle are shot using low-angle shot while those who are losing a battle are shot using a high-angle shot. While these little changes may seem insignificant, it actually changes the way you think and feel during each fight scene.[換行字元][換行字元]The emotional roller coaster that you will experience while watching Avengers: Endgame is unlike any other Marvel movie we have scene. The movie starts out with everyone feeling down due to Thanos' snap but quickly shifts due to an exciting glimmer of hope that they might be able to find Thanos and reverse everything he had done just three weeks earlier. Following every scene where a character seemed to be happy it would be followed by a scene that would make us teary eyed.[換行字元][換行字元]The great ending of the Infinity Saga was only possibly due to the great acting of Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man/Tony Stark) and Chris Evans (Captain America/Steve Rogers). The way that they interacted throughout this movie connected me to their characters in a different way I had never felt. The way that Downey Jr. and Evans made their characters seem like normal humans, who can go through the emotional roller coaster just like us, help create the unique connection that I had never seen or felt in any Marvel Studios film.[換行字元][換行字元]As in most Marvel Studios films there was a lot of CGI in Endgame. The CGI in was almost unnoticeable in the most intense situations throughout the movie. While you know that there is CGI in almost every scene, you weren't thinking about how it looked and if the computer generated images could be real places. A great example of quality CGI is when Tony Stark is stranded in the Guardians of the Galaxy spaceship.[換行字元][換行字元]The high quality acting, directing, writing, lighting, and angle choices helped make Avengers: Endgame truly special. Our emotions were toyed with and I enjoyed every moment of it. There will be a surprise in almost every scene which helped make Avengers: Endgame a great ending to the last 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
2991,Best movie of all time! So happy that Marvel did this.
2992,Avengers endgame has been the greatest MCU movie since 2008. This movie is filled with sad and comedy scenes the plot is just great. Really worth it And don't let anyone spoil you the movie.
2993,I can not find words to describe what was going on in my mind . Just perfect
2994,"Such a poor movie, I'm still fuming. The two brothers who made this movie should get arrested and never allowed to film anything anymore."
2995,"Disappointing, Emotional BS, Family BS, Random Moments that try to be funny, Overpowered Women, Underpowered Thor, Boring 1st Hour & many more....[換行字元][換行字元]This movie was a disgrace to the entire franchise. Watching the avengers & other marvel movies that all lead up to this.... Hell No![換行字元][換行字元]To all reading this review Do Not watch Marvel movies like I did; all those expectations lead to this... :-{ Investing all those hours & emotional energy & it all went down the drain.[換行字元][換行字元]I give the movie a 4 for the action scenes & the VFX, the rest was just Underwhelming."
2996,"Honnestly the best movie I've ever seen. For sure the build up has something to do with it but the Russo brothers just showed that they are the best directors in the MCU (Winter soldier, civil war, infinity war and now end game). We also have to thanks Kevin Feigi whom created a story line more sophisticated than anything ever done. THANKS MARVEL, YOU BROUGHT LIGHT ON PRETTY DARK DAYS."
2997,"An experience which you must go through yourself - thrilling, heartbreaking, fun, emotional, just the right mix of light and heavy - wholesomely integrating all the character story arcs into one beautiful conclusion - a film for all tastes and all ages."
2998,"A lot of people clearly liked the Avengers: Endgame. I heard Chris Evans cried in some places when he watched the finished movie. I could see what he meant but I didn't cry. In fact there was so much going on that I felt I needed a scorecard. Who was on screen, what was their motivation and what happened 2, 3 or 4 movies ago. I have seen all the movies but clearly not as up on it as some I met, who apparently had seen some of the movies several times.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall not bad but here are a few moans -[換行字元][換行字元]The infinity stones always seemed a MacGuffin to me. They appeared from nowhere and had strange powers, often not explained much or used much either.[換行字元][換行字元]I heard but don't really get Thanos's motivation. He seems to have some hand wavy reason for wanting to reduce the universe's population. Paradoxically, even though, he's the villain it plays into the rather PC idea that there are too many people. People are a blessing, not a curse.[換行字元][換行字元]Captain Marvel was played up a bit. She's the only one who can save the universe? Apparently she's been busy elsewhere until now.[換行字元][換行字元]Now in conclusion, not bad but not good. OK movie but could have been shorter for my liking.[換行字元][換行字元]For comparison, I had a brief look at what I'd watched in a cinema from the last 12 months and the ones that stood out include First Man, Shazam, Glass, Jurassic Wrold: Fallen Kingdom, Deadpool 2, The Happy Prince, Christopher Robin, Green Book, White Crow, Dumbo, Wild Rose. I find most of them better than Endgame."
2999,I came into this movie expecting so much and boy did it deliver. I was 22 when iron man first came out and and ever since then all the avengers characters have felt like a part everyones family who love the mcu avengers. I dont know how i feel now happy sad empty all in one. I need to watch it again to digest it first time watch you are sitting there going wow wow wow!!![換行字元][換行字元]This film is definitely the one of the best i dont think we will see a film this emotional big for a very long time. The way film is presented is awesome one scene u might be crying from sadness or happiness and it will cut to the next and you will crying from laughter. It gets a big thumbs up for its comedy. Its drama was on point every one knows something big is going to happen to our avengers but it doesn't matter you still can't prepare yourself. It like losing a pet whos been apart of your life for 10 plus years.[換行字元][換行字元]As the saying goes all good things must come to an end if only there was another way.[換行字元][換行字元]Enjoy this movie
3000,I just can't express how amazing this movie is. Go watch it for your self! First time reviewing a movie so I am not very helpful
3001,They ended it in the best way and i think there would be no better ending than this
3002,"End Game is pretty hyped as one of the best movies. And it is a great movie. The directors succeeded in connecting bits and pieces from the past and the present. While making all actors shine and draw the viewer in a hurricane of emotions. But as a result, the movies pacing feels messy, slow, repetitive and fragmented.[換行字元][換行字元]That doesn't hurt the movie, because it's greatest strength is in the actors, mainly Tony Stark who has the superpower to carry this movie by himself. Further there is the fanservice to include almost every relevant star from the past many movies. Unfortunately, I was hoping for a high octane action movie with compelling fights. Those fights where there, but they were quick, messy, chaotic.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie's biggest sin is absolutely not that it is a bad movie. It's good, but not as good as Infinity War, and that's a shame. All flaws aside, End Game is an emotional roller coaster, that works as a worthy goodbye to not only some actors, but a complete sage."
3003,This is by far one of the best movies I've ever watched.
3004,Great film! Loved it! Robert Downey Jr. was absolutely fantastic! Brilliant actor!
3005,"Sorry, I didn't like it. Too long, too nostalgic, too self congratulatory, too much..[換行字元][換行字元]Given it was better than Avengers Ultron but not by much."
3006,"Unbelievably fabulous . For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. What a visual treat. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many. I don't want to spoil anything. Watch it to experience the visual treat!"
3007,"Watch in Theatres and you'll love it, it's gurantee"
3008,"I've been reading comics for over 50 years, and honestly, I was never an Avengers fan of the comics. In film, well that's a totally different story. While this was a good movie, I really feel it was too long. It could have used some editing. It was paced quite differently from any other Marvel movie, leaving most of the action until the end and that's where it lost me. They killed off the wrong characters. Two of them were the most popular ones for me. There would have been more Pathos had they made different choices. I'm not going to spoil this for anyone and say who was killed off, that would be simply rude. But it makes me wonder, has Marvel, after 22 movies, run it's course? Will Disney's need for PC ruin Phase 4? Let's face it, Disney is all about money. Their cancelling of their agreement with Netflix was a terrible one. No more Punisher or Daredevil? (I couldn't really care about Iron Fist or Defenders and I think the way Luke Cage ended was terrible, but I'd have liked to see him again). So Phase Three is over. What's next for Marvel? I'm not looking forward to The Eternals but I am looking forward to Shang-Chi. So overall, I give this an 8. I knew a few characters were going to get killed, but there weren't really any big surprises in it. Did anyone really think Black Panther, after making a billion dollars was going to stay dead?"
3009,Yessssssssssssssssss this is the movie of the century
3010,"The title of this review may lead you to believe that I am not a fan of this film - which is false. I actually like this film quite a bit, but ultimately does not deserve the 'one of the best movies ever made' reputation it is getting.[換行字元][換行字元]Let's talk about the pros:[換行字元][換行字元]The visuals are outstanding. The CGI team once again prove they are on top of their game here and the work here is marvelous. I must also note that the directors (The Russo Brothers) did an excellent job of carrying 30+ characters into the film and still managing to give each and every one a moment to shine. There is also an exceptionally large amount of buzz surrounding the ending of this film (as well as the final hour in general), which I believe more than definitely contributes to the film being held with such high regard - and yes, the final hour is fantastic[換行字元][換行字元]BUT...[換行字元][換行字元]Let's not forget that this is a three-hour film and almost all of the flaws are contained in the first two hours. The majority of the first act of the film is significantly slower-paced to the rest, which on it's own works as it uses the time wisely as it perfectly portrays the aftermath of the events following Infinity War. However, this slow-paced first act ultimately affects the overall structure of the film as the second and third act are much faster.[換行字元][換行字元]I also have some issues with the second act, there are definitely some scenes here that could easily be removed without affecting the plot (and the film would actually be overall better as a result). For example: The 'diner' scene in which Hulk poses with fans is cringe-worthy at best and while it's intention is be funny is instead awkward.[換行字元][換行字元]CONCLUSION[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers: Endgame is definitely a must-watch for fans of the MCU and action films in general, but let's not overrate this purely because of the final act.[換行字元][換行字元]8/10"
3011,I have just finished watching Avengers End Game and have literally been blown away at how good it was.[換行字元][換行字元]It is a very fitting end to 11 years of MCU films and ties up all the loose ends nicely and gives characters the sign off deserved. I honestly cannot remember a 3 hr film passing so quickly. You'll laugh in places and I'm pretty darn sure you'll cry in places as well. I wasn't expecting to but I was gone in the final 15 minutes and I don't think there was a dry eye in the cinema either.[換行字元][換行字元]So go along sit back and enjoy Avengers End Game.
3012,Worst of the Worst !!! After IW(which is amazing) this was a disaster. BAd bad movie !!!!
3013,"I really wanted this to be the best ending ever but I was so disappointed. The other Avenger movies were very enjoyable but this one was different. Like Dr Strange said there are so many ways this could have ended. Unfortunately, in order to close the many arcs the story just felt forced, poorly paced with many many liberties taken that should not have been like the ""storm trooper wielding a light saber moment"" with Captain America. They also manage to get every woman in the film in the frame at the same time looking real tough. Do we really expect that 3.5 seconds of supposed girl power to inspire anyone? Give me a break! It's very condescending IMO. Also I felt like other characters were not properly utilized. Technically the film looked really good and the acting was great. I'll watch it at home once and probably never again. It will still make tons of cash and a lot of people seem to be satisfied."
3014,"This movie had so much to tell in 3 hours!! It honestly could have been longer and I still would have watched it because ever bit of content was amazing!!![換行字元][換行字元]I don't want to spoil anything because Ik people will read this for spoilers, but I will say that everything that happened was what I wanted from this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Stories come to an end while others start.

3015,"What I was thinking all this time of how this movie will be, it completely amazed me because it was really beyond my thoughts and I'm sure for many of you guys,(but not all) of what you had been predicted, it has all the emotions in this movie. It has a lot of sadness from the beginning and it was very funny also, a very great action which was an epic one(very unique)and adventurous too.most importantly it has really gave a shock about it, not one time but several times and it has really touched my heart, prepare for it because there's lot of sorrows, pain, comedy, shocking moments and it was worth of crying a lot. When I was watching this, it gave a lots of goosebumps too most of the time and every part of the movie, very minute was special and precious.It deserves to have a rating on 10/10.When you'll finish to watch it you will want for the fifth one as it deserves to have an another one because I can't believe that it's the last one and it really have ended. The last thing that I want to say for those who has not yet seen the movie is prepare yourself, keep your eyes big open,(don't look down when you're eating or anywhere else and don't blink too much) hold your applause and most importantly keep your excitement in silence because there will be a lot of unimaginable moments of which you couldn't believe. Please enjoy the movie to the fullest of your life.For me it's the greatest film of all time and for me it has already shattered all records and I guess for many of you also.The graphics and quality was really awesome as it was a little more superior than the infinity war and the actions too was really glorious and incredibly done, was astonished to see that.There will be some moments where you will be like freezing and and trembling too.So thank you and once again for the epic word, ""Whatever it takes"".Glory to the Avengers and may it be the one and only that nobody can break its record.Thank you once again"
3016,The pacing in this movie is flawed. The humour is forced. But this finale is fitting and satisfying
3017,"Always the end of a series will be emotional apart from that, its perfectly delivered to the fans!! Its hard to guess what will happen next so each scene is well connected. If you all are waiting for a big war this is the movie!! Enjoy 😊"
3018,Humour and Emotional are perfectly balanced this film. What did i say......just watch it...and feel it...with out spoliers...
3019,What a movie and what a conclusion for the epic infinity saga.
3020,Really good!! I think this is the best marvel film!
3021,"Time paradoxes are glossed over, bad story writing, completely wasted my time"
3022,If you are a 7 years old kid or you have a 7 years old mind you will love this movie ...
3023,"That was the greatest ending that was made for that world which started 11 years ago by making it so great and powerful[換行字元][換行字元]After losing by Thanos in Infinity war the whole team is starting to get them selfes ready by getting Captain Marvel to their team to defeat him and get every body disappeared again so what will they do ? Every body wanted to know what was going to happen after the ending of infity war Actually they made it great really great with powerful story that got every small and big thing from marvel universe with 3 hours ! That's unbelievable to get to know it ,it got every character that created the universe by a great way to end the game by it's suitable way[換行字元][換行字元]By the performances everybody did a great job that did what they supposed to do in every scene was created I can say that the best acting in the movie was done by Robert Downy Jr[換行字元][換行字元]The Visual effects were great with no any negative point in it,the sound system was good and I felt it in the theater,every simple thing that was supposed to be good was there and thanks to the Russos for getting every thing really great[換行字元][換行字元]The movie you should see it go see it as hard as you can if you're a great fan to marvel and if your not you can also go and believe me you're gonna see every thing can be made in any movie there gonna be action,comedy, great scenario I hope he get a chance by nominating it in the adapted screenplay next Oscars as Logan did,great acting,real drama,so many claps you will do if you're communicating will with watching the movie What you see about the movie with no spoiling if you saw it"
3024,Wished it ended in another way. You are not ready for this!
3025,A movie that combined 6 different movie timeline.....
3026,"Story was decent, albeit a bit predictable. CGI was cumbersome, but I expected it to be so I dealt with it. There were some really good poignant scenes made this movie watchable to me. The bad was there were your typical action movie cliches that after hearing the audience guffawing and cheering over them, I have come to to peace with the cliches will live on forever. What I found interesting was that there are some unanswered questions that make me think that this is not actually an endgame, but what do I know? They were pretty damn significant to just leave out.[換行字元][換行字元]Bottom line it was a fun movie to see with the family and it was definitely something to see on the big screen."
3027,Was well disappointed with this. I liked bits of it but I am finding difficulty recalling them.
3028,Bye bye Avatar! :) Endgame come to you! Your 9 year first place come to end next week! But this movie: Great end these 22 movies.
3029,"Echoing what many other reviews said, this was one of the few pop culture behemoths that lived up to its' hype... This was a fantastic conclusion to a wonderful 10 years of cinema from MARVEL (my only minute criticism would be that during multiple emotional scenes where crying was involved, I didn't see any tears -__-... But that's just me nit picking)"
3030,After 11 years and 21 films the end has came and it's a glorious conclusion to this amazing saga. Avengers endgame is probably the best superhero movie and marvel movie ever made in my opinion this movie is absolutely amazing and not like anything you have seen in a superhero movie. Avengers endgame is amazing and just a fantastic film to witness. This is gonna be a hard film to do a spoiler free review of but after a couple weeks of it being out I well post a spoiler talk. Here's my spoiler free review for avengers endgame. Pros- the acting in this movie is amazing and probably the best acting you have ever seen in the mcu yet everyone gives there best performance in the mcu yet. The characters are amazing and just great. Thanos again is an amazing villain and just a pure threat like in infinity war. The music wow is just amazing I can't stop playing the score it's just an amazing score and the movies music that they used fits so well. The action is just awesome and pure superhero magic. The story is awesome and just something to behold. There is never a dull moment. Cons: I don't have any. Overall- avengers end game is an amazing conclusion to the this saga. In my opinion it's the best superhero movie ever made and best mcu movie go see this movie as soon as possible. Avengers endgame gets a 10/10.
3031,"My 3000 love is far from enough.[換行字元][換行字元]Humors, actions and every entries are damned so glorious. I'm beyond speechless about this movie. Can I rate 12/10? I think marvel really put very serious effort on this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Every moment is so precious.[換行字元][換行字元]Btw, even this movie has 3hrs screentime, but this is the first time I experienced that no person went to the toilet during a movie! love the enthusiasm of the premiere launching in my country, love the applause, and really love the appreciation given until the very last moment the movie started the credit scene.[換行字元][換行字元]I do encourage my relative to put efforts on watching the whole avengers series to experience the greatest outcome from this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Yes, this is beyond great. Thank you marvel studio."
3032,"So, I have been going to all the Marvel movies since I was 8 years old when the first Iron Man came out. Since then it's been a part of my life that when Marvel would drop a new movie I'd be going whether that meant going with my brother or with friends. I always really took those movies and it's characters for granted. And I have to say, I couldn't ask for them to wrap up the Avengers saga in a better more emotional or entertaining way. I have never cried in a Marvel movie before, but this movie shed tears at least twice for me. For me this was a combination of the film's excellence and the sadness I faced seeing such a big part of my childhood come to a wrap. If you grew up with the Avengers like I did I have a feeling you'll feel the same, and even if you're not a hardcore fan, it makes a really fun and thrilling watch even with its 3 hour runtime."
3033,Yes I gave this movie a ten ... like i gave to Good Fellas or Casino or Aliens or Terminator 2. Why ? Because this movie is one of the best actions movies ever... CGI ... Actors... Story Directors ... are incredible. Yes it cost 360.000.000 USD ... the most expensive movie ever ... but at least they made an incredible Superhero Movie ... Marvel understood from the beginning how to make an entertaining film. I like Zack Snyder but the DC Comics movies are just trying it to make it serious ... Come one we want fights and funny conversations like in the comics ... The Story might be not 100 % in line or believable yeah give me a break we are talking about Superheros here ... they can do anything :) I am now waiting for the 4 Bluray Box for the Avengers and the 3 Bluray Boy of Captain America ... For me it ended now .... Great experience ... and I think it will take mabe some decades before they can do somethng like this again.
3034,"It was truly a remarkable movie. Slow at some points but overall still a great movie. If your expecting a non-stop fighting movie this wont be the one, but it definitely has a great story line through out the whole movie. It's funny and can be an emtional film for many, as this will be the last time we will see the Avengers."
3035,"I have 47 years old and very pop culture taste for movies.[換行字元][換行字元]I read Marvel comics from my first memory, my big hero is tony stark.[換行字元][換行字元]And this movie is a piece of art of our times.

Is important share something with the youngest.[換行字元][換行字元]Please just enjoy An event like this will be not repeated in at least in 10 years"
3036,Saw this in a theater with reclining chairs. Really comfortable! Amazing chairs. Would see it again in those chairs.
3037,"I wasn't a big fan of marvel movies but when I watched infinity war and Thor Ragnarok, it caught my attention. After watching those two movies I thought it wouldn't be that good but it was amazing 100 times better than I expected"
3038,Super anna tq so much This is the best movie in Marvel
3039,"Frank Capra had a golden rule - a movie can be many things but the number one sin is boring. Endgame - wanted to like it, spent money to like it, and .... boring. long, talkative and not worth the time. 2 hours would be fine, stretched to 3. Comedy was good mostly but not the padding. Long long intro shots of this and that. It finally hit the gold standard of DC. It took itself way way too seriously. So I am disappointed and sad. About right up there with Star Trek - The Motion Picture for boring. I don't like writing this, but ....... boring."
3040,Weldone team Avengers Hulk auntman Especially Thor had done a great job👍
3041,If you are a marvel fan you must watch it . Because it's a masterpiece .
3042,"This movie is revolutionary In what it has done. This movie was able to make a satisfying end to the biggest cinematic universe ever. There were many things in the movie which wouldn't normally be given a pass, however for such an ambitious project,most people-including me, were willing to turn a blind eye. This was a great movie for what it is meant to be, and I believe it achieved all it set out to do."
3043,They seem to have gone more family friendly and the comedy inserts they put in from here to there are just cringe worthy. More drama than action. No thanks
3044,"Endgame is the best superhero movie ever made. It reaches you in ways that you can't even imagine. It will make you laugh, it'll make you cry. It will make you experience a wide range of emotions without deflecting from the original storyline. With stunner starcast and their amazing performances, you'll definitely be spellbound."
3045,It's not as good as my expectation but it's still a must watch film for superhero fans
3046,Best avengers series am gonna miss them everyone should watch this
3047,"Finally found a spare hours to watch this without any interruptions.Massive let down for me stupid script,too long,glad its over."
3048,This had everything twist drama action and you know it over three hours long
3049,"Endgame, the last movie in the Infinity saga. Set's up an amazing final showdown with the purple brute himself.[換行字元][換行字元]It also wraps up the story lines of multiple veteran characters very will. This movie aims to please. Every fan will be satisfied."
3050,"Wow, what an ending to the incredible journey... Clever, endearing, thrilling, surprising, funny as, heartwarming and so utterly entertaining! How they accomplished so much within one film I do not know and yet those 3 hours went by in the blink of an eye. I would say that Captain Marvel sticks out like a bit of a sore thumb and is in contrast to the rest of the characters but thankfully she's not it in too much. All the favourites are on point throughout with special devotion given to the original 6 and yet it still manages to accommodate everyone new too. Quite a remarkable and I can't wait to get back to the cinema this weekend and watch it all over again! Thank you Marvel, you've achieved something extraordinary!"
3051,"Rarely i can say that a film has had considerable influence over me. And even rare is when a film takes control over me. Avengers Endgame is exactly that and more.[換行字元][換行字元]TBH i didn't know what to expect. The slightest of mistakes and it could tip the balance ( no pun intended) and they handled it as best as they could.[換行字元][換行字元]Usually i go for a long and delicate review. But this time, everybody pretty much knows what they're gonna get. There is nothing you will miss. Nothing you can brash this film for.[換行字元][換行字元]It will sure be an experience that you're gonna remember forever."
3052,"Since its release in 2012, The Avengers was for the longest time my favorite MCU film. Thor Ragnarok came close, but it fell short. After seeing the raw emotion that Endgame had, I had finally came to the conclusion that this movie is the new king of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Go see this movie immediately! As of May 4th, Avengers: Endgame is the best film this year."
3053,"The movie is plagued by plot holes. I will not go over all of them but I spent over an hour after the movie listing all the plot holes to my daughter. The biggest and the most ridiculous one is that the Avengers had only enough Pym particles for one round trip each. Movie made a big deal about this. But towards the end, Thanos uses one vial of Pym particle on his ship with everyone on board. With thousands of minion creatures on it. With no special ""Quantum"" suit or equipment. You mean to tell me Avengers could've just got on a vehicle and teleport all together with one vial? And with Hank Pym back now, they can time travel at will from now on. Or go back in time to get more just like they did in the movie. This completely ruins the Marvel Universe.[換行字元][換行字元]There also was a huge plot hole fail in The Last Jedi when Holdo sliced Snoke's mothership by going lightspeed. Which ruined the Star Wars Universe. And this rivals that plot hole. The Last Jedi was ruined by too many ridiculous plot holes.[換行字元][換行字元]Their version of time travel is a big mess too. It says past and future is not connected and changing past doesn't effect future but there are parts where it shows the new past effecting the future. And they were making fun of Back to the Future."
3054,Loved the movie. Don't think the story could have been any better. Had all the emotions with the positive ones being much more
3055,"It's long, and I don't mean in time length, but plot. It FEELS loooooong. The LOTR trilogy flew by. This...did not. And I'd love to know why Cpt. Marvel was in there at all. The climax is amazing. It is truly the climax of climaxes, but that's not surprising. Any superhero movie with its salt, is going to have a badass battle against good and evil."
3056,So so over hyped a bit above average but far too long. The hype here is real thank goodness I only paid $5. Wait for it come our on Firestick.
3057,"Too much CGI, forced jokes and not so interesting characters, typical of Marvel."
3058,"To make things simple, this movie is exactly what everyone wanted it to be, including myself of course. It's a great follow-up of the ""Infinity War"" which was simply astonishing and left room for sequel as it manages to maintain the pace, quality and excitement of its predecessor throughout its entire length of over three hours. It manages to be so dramatic, filled with action like every other installment but also very thrilling. You're always kept glued to the screen, waiting for the next thing to arrive with no room for boredom. The way it presents its ideas, its story but especially its action scenes is simply unique. As you can expect, all previous Marvel characters return to the scene with their great actors, which their job flawlessly regardless of the situation.[換行字元][換行字元]It's one of those rare movie which keep me excited from the first trailer, which generates interest even when it isn't released, which makes me search for the best place in a cinema the moment it appears just to see it as soon as possible. The great part about it though is that it didn't disappoint in any way. Although pretty lengthy, it provided a satisfying watch with a good conclusion to the franchise. I couldn't find almost anything against it, thus the only thing I can do is to award it the maximum rating that it deserves."
3059,"I was gonna write a long review but I'll just save it and say, go watch the movie. It was amazing."
3060,"The best emotional rollercoaster movie in history, from crying to laughing, from laughing to a showdown, the conclusion of 21 movies into an epic Bermuda Triangle of montage and twists. It was the perfect ending to the perfect 11 years."
3061,"What to say, it's a good movie... Okay? We get it. Lots of big name actors, special effects, and stuff. But c'mon, it's ANOTHER super hero movie, you know what to expect, and you'll have to sit there for 3 hours to get your 1-2 cool scenes that you paid money to see. Having said that, it's a good movie, I don't think anyone will debate that. But I honestly feel like the treatment of some of the characters, what they turned them into for this movie, it just doesn't work for me personally. I think it got RAVE REVIEWS because it's a big achievement, a capstone, a sendoff. And it *IS* a big deal in that way, but as a standalone, objectively-analyzed, critically-evaluated superhero movie, it's just about as good as any of the other dozen or so that came before it."
3062,"Again this is no spoilers at all, even no hints. First off I was spoiled a lot of aspects of the movie, so knew what I was expecting and still really really enjoyed it. The story and how it plays out is incredible and really clever. Rather being like infinity war with a large focus on Thanos and action scenes, this is definitely an avengers movie (the original 6 mainly) that is very character and relationship orientated. There isn't as much action until the third act and my god, the third act, imagine what you hoped for it and times it by 1000000. It's absolutely glorious. The second act was also so well done and such a fun thing to watch and piece together. The reasons why I have given it a 8 is because there are some issues I have with it, for a movie with such stakes I wish they took it a bit more seriously, and I think was too humerous and light hearted for what's going on, which meant significant tonal shifts for me personally. Also I feel like the first act was a little slow, although i perfectly understand why, and it was necessary for the story they were trying to tell but I wish there could of been an extra action sequence or something in the first act, as just a little extra. Also a scene or 2 in the third act, were a little disappointing and forced. And although there certainly is a lot of fan service in it, it makes the movie more enjoyable, although a little cliche/predictable. Overall I enjoyed this movie, it probably would of been a 9 for me if I wasn't spoiled anything. I enjoyed it just as much as infinity war, although very different movies (pacing and story wise). Would recommend for all MCU fans, however it doesn't hold your hand and you need to have watched previous movies in order for it to make complete sense, which could be a turn off for casual movie goers."
3063,"Watching this movie I was amazed that something like this was even possible! We have come such a long way![換行字元][換行字元]The Endgame was totally worth the wait and lived up to every sky high expectation set for it by Infinity War. This movie has laughs, cries, gasps, and sighs of relief. The last hour of the movie had my jaw dropping. The time and care put into each frame of the movie shows.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is truly the end....the end of a 21 movie story arc, we say goodbye to some of our most beloved characters as well as further embrace others. This movie truly is the swan song of the MCU. It isn't perfect but as the saying goes, ""there is grace in their failings."""
3064,"The movie is the closest to perfection I've seen. Every ingredient you need to make the perfect movie was all here. Thank you a million times over to the great Stan Lee, Marvel, Disney, and the creators and actors of this movie for one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life."
3065,"Yeah I was highly disappointed in this movie. It didnt deliver on anything I hoped for. I wanted to like it too. I dont even like to talk bad on these movies because we are lucky enough just to get these characters on the big screen, but this was easily my least favorite marvel cinematic universe movie. I hate to say it but my top 5 least favorite comic movies are probably now... 1. Batman and Robin 2. Batman v Superman 3. Justice league 4. Green lantern 5. Avengers endgame 6. (Incase you were wondering) Thor: darkworld"
3066,"I did not know what to expect. Of course, the end of the film is already clear in advance, only with such films the way there plays the decisive role. The Russo brothers managed to bring a trip that lasted more than ten years with over twenty films to a grand finale in my opinion. Quite unlike the previous movies where there were massive CGI battles, the perceived eternity lasted, which is not bad, this time they have managed to create a perfect balance of action, comedy and drama. For me personally it could have been a few more CGI fights but otherwise just perfect. I have read several other recessions of major newspapers and am always amazed how some people manage to deform such a work. Already clear that it is not a mega movie content that is extremely profound. But with such an expectation you can not go into any action and or comic movie. That's comparable to Mc 'Donalds ordering a burger and expecting Kobe beef. Making a name for more than twenty films to build such a story will for a long time remain an unsurpassable masterpiece of film history. Thanks for the great trip."
3067,I'm 17 years old and have seen every mcu box office movie. i have been going with my dad ever since the first iron man until endgame. This is the first time in my life it felt like time has passed just like that. It was great to see a movie that truly wrapped up the entire franchise. i cannot thank you enough to marvel studios and what they have done for me. i will never forget these movies and will forever be thankful to everyone involved in this movie. thank you <3
3068,"Just watched Avengers Endgame at the cinema and OH anyone who is watching this is in for a real three hour treat, which has lots of twists and turns along the way. All I will say about this movie is this is the Endgame that you will never predict any fan theories fly out the window as you are going to get properly mind blown as it would be one of the last endings that you would expect. If you thought Infinity War had you scratching your heads full of theories, well endgame just blows out the window and who knows what will happen next. All I say is I would definitely recommend watching this awesome movie as there will be funny parts and a lot of emotionally challenging scenes and a lot of action like the typical Marvel Movies we know and love, nevertheless you will find that you will not be disappointed I definitely recommend watching it as there will be many more MCU Movies to come to explain the aftermath of this movie. I cannot wait to see more Marvel Movies as I am so impressed on how the screen play writers has constructed this incredible universe of stories and how well it has been portrayed by the incredible very hugely talented actors in this film by new actors and returning actors alike they have all done a brilliant job Well Done And Congratulations."
3069,"First you should watch all the marvel movies in the right order so you can fell what evrey fan felt, second watch this movie before someone spoil it for you."

3073,"I really enjoyed this movie. I liked it just as much as Infinity War. I'm sad Endgame won't be on Netflix ( it will be on Disney Now, for a ridiculous price) so I can just stream all the Avenger Movies right after each other.[換行字元][換行字元]We see a lot of great characters get a good ending. 3 hours seemed like a long time when going in to the theater but eventually the filmed picked up its pace.

3074,Just watch this epic final of the best Marvel movie ever!
3075,"I found the story and the rhythm of the movie so messy, slow and boring. Really expected more."
3076,"Marvel fans in Hong Kong almost booked many seats before this week's theatrical release of Avengers: Endgame (2019) which series made the biggest box office hit in the history of Hong Kong film since 1897 (some archive source referred 1896 which same with Japan).

3078,"I'm not writing this review just from a comic book fan or a nerd but also as a movie lover. I didn't even feel the 3 hours, the pacing was just that well done. I would suggest that, if you haven't already, make an effort to watch the 21 MCU movies before this one cause it becomes so rewarding by the end of watching Endgame. I left the theater feeling fulfilled and accomplished and I was just sitting and it was as if I was reading an epic graphic novel from start to finish. Having now watched all the MCU released at this point made me more aware of the many nods, Easter eggs, and references through out the whole movie. I appreciate how in many ways, they managed to incorporate all of other 21 MCU movies into this #22 narrative of the story. It came together so amazingly and if you're not fully aware, you could miss it. This has become among my top favorite Marvel movies and sure, no film will completely be perfect but this one is pretty close in my opinion."
3079,Three hours of greatness. So many emotions after watching this movie. Thank you Marvel for such an amazing series.
3080,I will not spoiled anything from my heart I love 3000
3081,In trying too hard Marvel have actually ruined what could have been a perfect end to their storyline and a wonderful start to prequels for certain characters. This movie was soo long unnecessarily that it has put me off from watching another Marvel movie again with the exception of Black Panther and Spider-Man.
3082,"Finally, The Saga of Eleven Years, The conclusion of the largest storyline of the biggest universe is Marvelous, a feast to the fans. Many great moments through out the film. The climax that makes the audience go mad. The Directors used the huge cast perfectly. An emotional ending to our favorite hero's, endings we call perfect. All of them got those, what they deserve. The Marvel Women's one of the best thing in the movie. Surely you will say that once you watch the flim. Finally perfect ending to the Infinity Saga. Definitely you will love it."
3083,"The best film in the MCU? 100%. The best film I have watched personally? Definitely. Avengers: Endgame was incredible. After watching Iron Man exit that cave in a makeshift suit of armour, I had no idea that this would be where the MCU would head. The Russo Brothers and Kevin Feige have created something that has changed the way movies will be viewed, and the way films are created.[換行字元][換行字元]From the get go, Endgame presents itself as more than an action super hero film. All of the characters have vast backstories built over the past 11 years, allowing for this film to explore certain interactions between the hero's. I have seen some reviews that believe the movie starts fairly slow in the first act, with ""too much talking"". What utter nonsense. This is exactly what I wanted from Endgame, for the remaining Avengers to explore in depth how they feel and their relationships with one another. The emotion behind it all really brings the audience right in.[換行字元][換行字元]After the Avengers decide how to deal with 'the snap', that's when the story goes crazy. So much nostalgia and action in the final 2 acts. The CGI is faultless. Without saying why, the final 20 minutes of the film is quite possibly the best sequences I have ever seen. It brings together the last 11 years of the MCU into one place. Allowing for the closure of story arch's, and the new branches of others.[換行字元][換行字元]This film is outstanding. It topples everything. Action, humour, emotion, and of course The Avengers. Since watching Endgame at the midnight launch, all I've been doing is thinking about that movie and the occurrences in said film. It will stick with me forever.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you The Russo Brothers, Kevin Feige, Marvel, and of course, Stan Lee, for creating this groundbreaking cinematic universe. The end of the Infinity Saga. It's the Endgame."
3084,"I haven't written a lot of movie reviews but I have penned down my share of restaurant reviews which means I do understand how this paid publicity works and all of that. And I am starting my review from this statement as I did see some negative reviews here, initially and I was like "" may be all these niners are publicist's reviews"" But then after having watched the movie I would say that may be the reviews which are in tune of less than 6 are from the ""bad publicity"" fraternity. :) Like good & bad, ying & yang .. when there are paid people to write excellent reviews the vice versa is also true. For the very first time I felt that the reviews giving them a 3 or a 4 saying ""meh"" are really not the true reflection of Avengers : Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie was extremely well made .. the story knitted very well .. a mix of the past and present .. and all of those perfect comic moments as you would expect .. I enjoyed it from the first scene to the last and everyone present in the theater did too .. when there are laughters and gasps and cheers and sobs and people wanting to stay back after the movie .. in a 3 hour movie .. in America .. it means it is absolutely a beast of a show. Endgame is a perfect saga .. which will go down as one of the best of the best."
3085,"Avengers is the best movie ever. Avengers: Endgame is a cinematic event that must be witnessed on the big screen, marking the end of an era for Marvel but one that still exceeds expectations with fantastic writing, emotional value, nostalgia, and visuals and set pieces that will be remembered for the rest of however long superhero and action movies continue to be made. Thank you, Marvel Studios, for making such a sensational universe and making the experience of being a fan an unforgettable one."
3086,This movie set a good example on how to wrap a complicated story the best way possible. It definitely met the expectations of the fans. It focused on different main characters who got what they have deserved after their long journey in the MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]Thanks Marvel for this Epic Saga.
3087,"After watching the premiere tonight, this movie is the best one I have ever seen, Better than Dark Knight. The laughter is on another level with some serious cry because we are in the endgame now, it is expected. The way they have assembled all the 21 movies in 1 epic 3 hour screenplay is completely mind blowing and astonishing. The Russo brothers are pure epitome of perfection to showcase MCU at its best. Thank you MARVEL STUDIOS and STAN LEE for giving us such epicness. Some might not like it, might not remember about it but not us - is what I will tell myself even after 10 more years."
3088,"It has been, a little under eleven years since I saw the first iron man movie with my dad in the movie theater, at the time none of us really could imagine what was in store for us. the infinity saga is one of the most complex stories I have ever seen strung together within the cinematic universe. Endgame has everything I could have asked for, humor, plot twists, world-class acting, life lessons, heartbreak, and most importantly closure, and although not all of them are great, I am certain that I one day will make my kids watch the entire saga in the hopes that they will find them as special as we did.[換行字元][換行字元]To The Russo brothers, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee, and all the other geniuses behind this amazing adventure, Thank you for telling us your story."
3089,"If you thought infinity war , captain marvel , iron man , and other marvel movies were amazing you will will be having fun in this it's funny sad and exciting this is the best movie ever"
3090,"I have know idea what to say about this epic movie. Going in I've never seen a movie in IMAX before. That was unbelievable to see and watch. All I can say without giving any spoilers. This movie is entertaining, epic, fun, and incredible. This movie didn't feel like a 3 hour movie. All I can say this movie was jaw dropping, epic movie. Like I said on Twitter. I haven't seen a movie like this in a long time. My rating is 10/10. Probably go see it again soon. Go see this in IMAX it's worth the money. #avengersendgame #imax #ironman #captainamerica #thor #rocketraccoon #hulk #blackwidow #avengersassemble"
3091,Too be honest I didn't think marvel could top what they did in infinity war but they have just exceeded expectations and brought out the biggest and greatest movie I have ever watched
3092,"After all these 22 movies and 11 years this movie really delivering what fans wanted, I never expected this movie to be this great"
3093,Extraordinary movie. I can't say much as it was like I am in the movie.. that's it..😘
3094,Just to give you some advice anyone who is thinking about seeing this film they need to watch the past Avenger films from the start.[換行字元][換行字元]The storyline might be a little bit of getting used to but overall it is still a great plot for a Avengers film. After the end of Infinity War it was good to see how the characters had moved on and how the world is picking up the pieces of what had happened. When the sh*t goes down in terms of the action it really is on par and in some aspects beats Infinity War in terms of the diversity and the use of what each character is shown to do.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall a solid Avengers Film
3095,A perfect way to end the avengers saga. This movie will have you feeling all your emotions. Totally worth the 10 years of movies and the 3 hour play screen
3096,This is the best avengers movie I've seen. It's also one of the best movies I've also seen overall.
3097,"It was underwhelming. I guess I had expectations for it, some people hyped it up too much. Infinity was better."
3098,I'm not a big marvel fan. I can say this was different from a lot of there movies I can see the change they have made starting with Captain Marvel. It has a softer touch to it. It connect more with family and women.
3099,"For Avengers, is good Conclusion, a lot twit story, and time traveler things, hmm seem good concept, but just one thing i really notice, is, Captain Marvel is useless, not really perfect. Just my opinion"
3100,"It's every marvel fans dream come to reality, people can nip pick the time travel but that's not really a flaw because they done it right by giving the fans what they want, the movie has lot of fan services but it never hurts the plot it actually helps it and it shows how much the russo brothers cared about this universe, by time the movie ends you feel like a life time has past, the end of an era."
3101,"This film was unbelievably well executed. It was very emotionally deep, very funny, and intense fight scenes. This movie is full of surprises, but they make it turn out to be a great story. I will see this movie again and again and again."
3102,"Spoiler free..... For those who have given this a 10, take that with a pinch of salt, it really isn't. There's a strong argument that suggests infinity war was an overall better film. Endgame drags in places as it tries to cram in so much more, building up to a noteably predictable ending. The direction some of the characters have taken this time around is polarising and didn't work for me. Some key MCU characters going forward we're also given limited screen time which, for those keen to know what the future holds.. I'm not sure anyone really knows now.[換行字元][換行字元]Whilst the changing of the guard will be welcomed you do get a sense of, this is really the end of a great journey for marvel. Barring a series of solo follows ups and a play in the tv series space we're unlikely to see an avengers style films of this magnitude anytime soon![換行字元][換行字元]I've always been a fan ever since the iron man graced our screens, however for me, they have slipped up quite a few times along the way (Thor series) was poor and captain marvel was average."
3103,"I didn't like this movie the first time, coming out of the theater pissed as hell. It took a second Imax viewing to really appreciate this film. They had a lot of characters in this film, and it was amazing that they balanced them so well."
3104,Perfect story and truly a good end after 22 films. I feel like if I hadn't seen all 22 films then I would have not known what was going on and I would have been lost. I also think Thanos could have been better in this and he is no where near as good of a character but I think that is because Avenger Infinity War was his story and this is more Iron man's and Captain America's. However it is still one of the best films in this time and it will be remembered for a long time as one of the greatest blockbusters of all time.
3105,I'm a fan of sci-fi movies & following the marvel series I just enjoyed the endgame every second of it..
3106,People giving out less then 9 stars are biggest idiots and don't deserve such good movies. How can u give so less rating to such a Masterpiece like this. You are pathetic people who don't deserve good movies.
3107,"Holy S*** its amazing! worth all 3 hours, its too good"
3108,A masterpiece of the 21th century that have a great plot line and a great production. I have no farther words to say.
3109,10/10. Fully lives up to the hype. Totally recommended.
3110,He deserves an OSCAR. What he did for marvel and the fans was great. I'm great full to TONY STARK. LOVE YOU 3000.💔
3111,"I cried and laughed and blah, blah, blah. CGI was great, but I can't get past all the subtext to create plot rules and then completley blow them put of the water. I can think of about 5 minutes of scenes and a slightly different way to handle the last moments of the battle that would have covered those holes. I can't believe no one said ""Hang on a minute. This wont work."""
3112,"After the infinity war, i think this was the best movie for all avengers fans but according to me all heores of this movie forcefully fit in this movie. I am not saying, movie is not entertaining. Major think is that this part not follow the comic story which is very best according to me. All are good but giving 8 star."
3113,I expected an action movie with a real battle. Unfortunately it was just a loong and boring exchange of lines..
3114,It's the best superhero movie of all time. IT made me cry like 'literally' the last 20 mins of the movie.
3115,"If you think you have figured it out all yet you haven't, amazing ending to the greatest saga, 3 hours have passed like it was an hour, the humor is there, the tears, the powerful visuals, won't say much, every person has to see it. Amazing amazing amazing"
3116,A satisfying conclusion to the the last 11 years of the MCU.
3117,They should have called it Captain America: end game Every scene is oriented to that useless character
3118,I was slightly underwhelmed by the movie and I didn't cry at the ending at all. There was far too much sickly sweet scenes for my liking.[換行字元][換行字元]The time travel bit left more questions than answers for me. The 2nd click mmmm[換行字元][換行字元]I won't be going to see anymore Marvel movies apart from maybe Black Panther as I'm done
3119,You have seen a zillion movies and think you know everything a film maker can do .And then you watch this and all that ego shatters to dust. I never can believe the emotion the film brought in me . The one line (spoiler alert) that I AM IRON MAN destroys you away. Just unbelievable
3120,Endgame was hands down the worst entry in the Marvel cinematic universe. I've had random bouts of depression ever since i saw this film. It ruined so many of the films that preceded it i have no words. Zero stars if i could.
3121,"Absolutely loved the Endgame. A perfect and a satisfying end to an epic saga. It exceeds your highest expectations with too many pleasant surprises. An experience you will remember forever. The final hour of the movies is a perfect masterpiece filled with goosebumps, excitement tears. A new benchmark has been set for the upcoming superhero movies."
3122,I watched this movie on the pre-release fan day on Thursday April 25th. After a year of fan theories and guessing game. This movie was totally different from what I was expecting to see. It was a complete emotional rollercoaster. With really high peaks and an ending I didn't see coming. This is a must see movie. I do have to admit that it was not as good as Infinity War. I feel that the comedy was a bit too much and some of the fight was not how I think it should have been. But I left with a smile and going to watch it again. It was just too much to take in in one seating. My emotions couldn't handle this amount of info.[換行字元][換行字元]LOVED IT!!
3123,Thanks marvel for this amazing ride and the perfect ending
3124,"1st I want to say that while quickly scanning the reviews, I happened across multiple, as in probably 5-6 reviews saying things like, ""the entire theater was crying"", OR ""full grown men were balling like babies"".[換行字元][換行字元]AND my personal favorite... ""The movie was soooo good that 3 different times throughout the film! THE ENTIRE audience stood up giving a standing ovation!!""...... SERIOUSLY?!? We get it, you think it's a good movie. But just quit all the drama already!.... These comments are just creepy! Yeah, the entire theater stood up, in the middle of the movie no less, and everyone clapped.. Then got back up 30 min later to do it again! Oh yeah, and for good measure, got up to clap at the end too!!.. I mean come on, what's the point of wasting space and time in the comments making up and lying about this kind of stuff?? I just really don't get it, like at all. Just say it's your favorite and move on.[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]And now that I finished with my rant lol.... Like everyone else said, it is a good movie.. Definitely one of the better ones.. Although I feel a few details should have been worked out better and thought through a little more. Even with how good this movie was, I think it could have been even better, possibly even a lot better! Don't get me wrong, it is a very good movie, one you can watch more than once.. I just think some parts didn't quite match up to the narrative of all the previous ones.. For example, most of the characters behavior and actions have been pretty consistent throughout the years but then they act completely different in the finale.. Just a little too much of a change for multiple characters!"
3125,"My rating of the film could change to an 8, but I still loved this movie. It's hard to judge it on its own, mostly because this movie can't be viewed on its own. I don't feel like elaborating on anything other than the fact that this is the only MCU movie I've given a 9. Like I said, could go down to an 8, but I have to rewatch it first."
3126,"Good god what were the writers thinking. back to the future meets avengers? they made it so advanced that the story is hard to follow. they were only going for jokes. like hulk running down stairs saying "" so many stairs "" why the heck would Hulk run down the stairs? they were going for cheap laughs. nothing more. they just cant hack out a good story."
3127,"They even managed to disrespect their last movie, Infinity War"
3128,"Avengers Endgame is the kind of movie that should be thankful that it had 22 movies build-up to it because in terms of story-telling, it was very dire and nearly non-existent even. However, it is not something that should be frowned-upon because then again that was this movie only purpose, to finish the said build-up.[換行字元][換行字元]When it comes to how this movie stood as a conclusion then you would find yourself mostly be satisfied by it as the movie took great deal in understanding the main characters (the original Avengers) and how their arc should end. To my liking, I didn't like how they ended one main character arc and how they potrayed another main character arc but for the latter I guess it could be developed to something interesting in near future. If you followed the entire saga or only the ones with og Avengers in it and if you even grew up with them, you will find the last 30 minutes of the movie to be a masterpiece in terms of fan-service to both the comics and MCU fans. I will admit that being a more DC fan that I cheered for some of the scenes and was also absolutely stunned.[換行字元][換行字元]Having said that, I did say that the story in this movie should not mean much but then again it doesn't mean that it should be absolutely meaningless. Yes, there was an interesting concept by the writers on the Avengers plan to return half the population of the universe but the lazy writing or perhaps unintentional lack of attention to details made the said concept arose a few hundred questions. For three hours this movie depended on the great MCU movies that came before and served as a more fan-service than a good plot device for the first and second act.[換行字元][換行字元]The stars in this movie were all good. RDJ and Chris Evans were the stars of the movie. Hemsworth did brilliant with an interesting take of his character. Renner showed his capability. Johansson proved that she is a very good actor because finally the filmmakers took a great deal in writing her character right.[換行字元][換行字元]All in all, this is the movie that you should still watch. You would not think about its flaws when you are watching it because you will focus on how they ended the saga and boy, did they do it perfectly."
3129,"What a fantastic film. This is the second film ever to make me cry while watching it and that is no small achievement. Long time fans of the past 11 years of Marvel movies will not be left dissapointed by this. Decent humour, fantastic visuals and an amazing movie that ties all the loose ends from before, and threads new rope for the future."
3130,"When Jon Favreau's ""Iron Man"" came out in 2008 with a witty Robert Downey Jr. as the lead man, I don't think even Marvel had such great expectations, yet in a bit over a decade, the so-called MCU became the trademark when it comes to blockbusters and ""Avengers: Endgame"", directed by the Russo brothers (Anthony and Joe), is their ""destiny fulfilled"".[換行字元][換行字元]So, just in the absurd case you are a Marvel fan and have second thoughts whether you should spend your money on this, then the answer is simple--yes. This film ticks every single box when it comes to properly concluding the ""lore"" of the MCU and then some! It is the ultimate wet dream for any comic-book fan, a complete, satisfying sphere of everything for everyone whose focus on entertainment is centered on all things Marvel.[換行字元][換行字元]Predictably, this film has no time for itself. Think about it, this is the culmination of 22 other works, its primary purpose being to put in order over a decade of cliffhangers, loose ends and post-credit scenes. It is condemned to carry a great burden, something that no film should do, and it carries it perfectly even if that means sacrificing its own identity. Viewing this from the point of an impartial person, stripping down all its dependencies, you get nothing more than a textbook executed blockbuster.[換行字元][換行字元]This is not necessarily a bad thing right now, as technology isn't impacting enough to tear down the core of the art of cinema (3D, happily, does not ruin it). Yet as I watched the ending, I could not help but feel this was the end of an era not only for Marvel, but for blockbusters as well. This is, after all, the blockbuster's final form as of now making this an essential viewing despite being far from a masterpiece.[換行字元][換行字元]""Avengers: Endgame"" might not be much more than a meta-film, like the glove whose only purpose is to be a vessel for the infinity stones, but at least it is one whose contents consist of sustained excitement, sweet retrospectives and, as usual for any Marvel film, dotted about with their trademark, perfectly timed humor--yes, even here, in the final hour."
3131,"I have loved the MCU for years but I am more than diappointed with this movie. #[換行字元][換行字元]Superficially is felt similar to the others even though the plainly obvious addition of emotional scenes to wrap up a few of those characters was at times just too on the nose and I personally am not a fan of how it ended in general, there are just so many inconsistencies and plain errors in the timeline of the movie, that I guess are either going to be ignored or tried to be patched up after the fact.[換行字元][換行字元]Fantasy only works for suspending reality if they stick to the rules they define for their own universe and Endgame dropped the ball multiple times on this. It's disappointing, that this is how it ends."
3132,Amazing.... I have no further words to express my feelings.. Thanks for this amazing trip Marvel !!
3133,At start it was good that we saw the aftermath of IW but it was kinda going stable. Although the last 40 min was the best time I have ever had
3134,I think it was good but quite a sword to keep up with because I hadn't seen the others
3135,"Marvel do a fantastic job on this one, everything and everyone come togetaher perfectly. They capture the magic and spirit of the superhero.[換行字元][換行字元](There is only one scene which is bad, fake, put on and most importantly not needed.)"
3136,"Great movies and great actors with great acting, great editing, Thank you"
3137,"Avengers endgame is an epic conclusion of 10 years of hardwork by all the stars, crew membersand every single person who made contribution. The Epic conclusion to 22 movie marvel movies. The Movie has a hell lot of action and Emotions. It made us cry and laugh at the same time. Experience it yourself in your near theatres. This movie is a gem and will be watched for many coming year."
3138,Listen I'll take X-Men over the avengers any day. boring characters
3139,"Avengers: Endgame is the final film to the Infinity saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story is emotional, unpredictable, unforgettable, complex and intense. The story does continue on right after infinity war had finsihed, and I thought it was a good way too start because the characters can give you an understanding of how they are feeling. How much loss they have witnessed. During the three hour film, you care so much for the characters that it makes you want them to live through the whole time, leaving with no casualties. The acting by the cast is outstanding, none of their lines sounded cheesy. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr especially. The audience has never seen the two characters shine so bright and powerful over the last 11 years. The visuals are the most impressive, it is shown to be Oscar worthy and you would be hungry for more as the film continues on. The final battle was the bomb, the mother of all battles, better then Ready Player One's finale. It's so big and all of it fits in perfectly. Avengers Endgame is the perfect finale that has been set up over the last 11 years. Its a rewatchable film and you will never see the characters the same way as you have seen them from the past films."
3140,"Loved Endgame but with a lukewarm feeling for The Eternals and Shang Chi on the horizon, I wondered whether the MCU should make more logical choices for the next phase. Obviously there are development issues with the FF and X-Men franchises and DC's Aquaman may well scupper a potential Sub-Mariner movie, but perhaps these would work:[換行字元][換行字元]1) Captain Britain (we heard 'Braddock' mentioned by Peggy Carter in Endgame; Brian's father perhaps?) 2) Alpha Flight. With the Avengers having run their course, perhaps their Canadian counterparts could step up. It stands to reason that other countries would want to copy the Avengers model (I know they are the Earth's protectors but they pretty much belong to the USA). 3) Moon Knight. Although I would love to see Daredevil done right on the big screen, maybe Marc Spector could fill the void. 4) Silver Surfer. Norrin Radd was the best thing about the FF sequel. A space-based movie would give him room to soar. Look to GotG or the Ron Lim Thanos issues of Silver Surfer for inspiration. 5) Ka-Zar. Although often perceived as a Tarzan rip-off, Lord Kevin Plunder's exploits could open up a whole new playground with the Savage Land.[換行字元][換行字元]I wonder if we'll look back in 10 years and see if any of these came to pass...!"
3141,"Wow it's so amazing. I didn't expect in the final battle. This movie makes me want to cry. No much word to say or spoiler from me, you must see with your eyes."
3142,Have enjoyed the Marvel movies up until this one. I am curious about the high ratings and would find it interesting to see everyone give their age along with their review. I have a sneaking suspicion that the higher reviews are coming from much younger people. Not to disparage their reviews and I respect their opinions but simply attempting to understand the high marks. This aspect I am writing about is the only part of this movie experience I find interesting because this movie provided nothing positive worth writing about.
3143,Awsome. Im stunned. How in gods name can someone give this movie a rating of 1?
3144,"I've never written a review on here before so that tells you something. I left the theater mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausted. I laughed. I cried. It was what we have been watching all these years for. It was the perfect ""end"" of an era."
3145,Looking forward to whats next! The culmination if all the storylines with a satisfying ending. A+
3146,"Seems that they separated every good parts and put them in Infinity Wars and leftovers into this one. Plot is ridiculous, with most of the heroes unused/underused. Are those actors even involved in making of this movie? It is more like clip show episode, made of chaotic parts from previous Avengers, where even CGI quality is different or in the worst case, they combine new things into old scenes, so difference in quality is even more obvious.[換行字元][換行字元]Time will lower rating of this movie when hype stop. Now, this movie is first one in All time worldwide gross, so it will be more criticized (Avatar can rest now).[換行字元][換行字元]I watched it in full cinema in first days of screening. We laughed on stupidity of some scenes (every one in theater). At the end, on exit, after 3 hours of painfully boring and bad movie, nobody talked about it... Just wanted to leave this misery behind it."
3147,"The previous episode was , ad least entertaining ...this one is just SO boring and sometimes so depressing ...3 hours trying not to yawn and more difficult , not to fall asleep ( Hopefully the fluctuation of the sound level between dialog scene and action one help me not to ! )[換行字元][換行字元]PS : there's a good new , though , it's supposed to be the last one !"
3148,"It's a pretty good movie and provides a good bookend to the saga. Endgame succeeds in what it tries to do in the superhero genre and deserves a high rating in that respect. Conversely, in a holistic context it's not one of the greatest movies of all time as the overall rating suggests."
3149,"Robert Downey Jr.'s gaunt Tony Stark records his message to his beloved Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, aboard the disabled spaceship last seen in ""Avengers: Infinity War"", ""Part of the journey is the end..."" After 11 years of Marvel movies, Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo's ""Avengers: Endgame"" signifies the end of the journey with laughter and surprising poignancy. At one point holdout Avengers leader Natasha (former assassin Black Widow), played by beautiful soulful Scarlett Johansson, refers to the Avengers as ""family"". That resonates for us, too. For the last 11 years these screen Heroes have become family. We care what becomes of them. Do they find peace?

Yet, what inspires most about ""Endgame"" is family and heart.[換行字元][換行字元]Most of ""Endgame"" takes place 5 years after Titan's Warrior Thanos decimated half the population of the universe, including about half of the Avengers. Here less is actually more. Where as in ""Avengers: Infinity War"", way too many Superheroes resulted in the kluged narrative, focusing on the surviving Heroes: Chris Evans's Captain America (Steve Rogers), Robert's Iron Man, and Chris Hemsworth's Thor, displaced God of Thunder, empowers the story. Brie Larson's all-powerful Captain Marvel charismatically emerges as the new Avenger. Too bad the Russo's couldn't leverage more for Brie. Then again, that might have been narrative saturation.[換行字元][換行字元]Where ""Infinity War"" was so dour and so self-absorbed, ""Endgame"" has a wicked sense of humor.

Tony hugs Howard, who expressed doubt about being a good Father, saying, ""It'll work out."" Then you realize that was the only time the two had ever hugged. On that same trip back, Chris Evans's Steve wistfully gazes at Peggy Carter, played by captivating Hayley Atwell. Peggy is the forsaken love of Cap's life.[換行字元][換行字元]Chris Hemsworth's Thor travels back to the Norse legendary Asgard to retrieve an Infinity Stone. He encounters his mortal Mother Frigga, the powerful sorceress played by beautiful strong Rene Russo, on the day she's to die. In a subdued joke, rotund Thor has seen better days, since failing to dispatch Thanos in ""Infinity War"". His loving Mom tells her son that she knows that he's suffered. Looking into his eyes Frigga says, ""The measure of the Hero is being true to yourself."" Amen.[換行字元][換行字元]Really, ""Endgame"" is awesome, because of heart. In that Karen Gillan is understated power as the mostly machine Nebula, daughter of Thanos. Her Father had contested her against sister Gamora, played by brilliantly strong Zoe Saldana, for his love. Tortured and devalued Nebula, becomes ravaged with vengeance upon her Father. Yet, Karen makes us believe that Nebula's soul is worth salvation.[換行字元][換行字元]Yeah, at 3 hours and 1 minutes ""Endgame"" is the restroom challenge. I kid, well sort of. Despite all that, I loved ""Avengers: Endgame"". It's the poignant, whimsical end of the journey. At least for me, the Avengers are my fictional Hero family. Like the characters on the wide screen, we all experience suffering, profound loss, joy, and triumph. In life, like Chris's Cap says, ""Take your baby steps... Move forward."" I for one shall remember the Avengers in my heart."
3150,"The perfect way to end an era for so many fans worldwide. Goosebumps, head in hands, tears of laughter and sadness - an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish."
3151,With a strong movie like Infinity War I had high hopes for Endgame. But it didn't live up to my expectations
3152,"Infinity War by far the best Marvel by a long way. However Endgame half the film was boring and only the last 10 minutes had an resembles to Infinity war.[換行字元][換行字元]Thick Thor, Professor Hulk brilliant the rest average."
3153,"If you adore science fiction and followed Marvel AND DC, despite their differences, and Despite the bad 1 star reviews (haters gonna hate!) I assure you that YOU will LOVE this movie because of all what it expresses, from Science fiction, Emotions, Sounds, Twists, Story line, and I mean everything about this movie is incredible... Just watch it and don't listen to anyone, I guarantee you will be Surprised, Laugh, Cry, and have a beautiful and unforgettable Core memory for an amazing movie."
3154,
3155,"I would like to start by saying I'm a huge MCU fan. I completely get why people love this movie! it's a fun, end to a adventure that has been a part of many peoples lives for a long span of time. It is a great movie however it escapes me how people can watch this movie and not see huge flaws with the it. The best thing I can say is stuff just doesn't make sense.[換行字元][換行字元]*Stuff in shots that isn't there in the next shot. *Simple story explanations were not present. *overall the story felt bland actually.[換行字元][換行字元]With that said, overall you will have a good time watching the movie."
3156,This movie is nothing but what a comic book fan expects.... The movie brings out an epic climax battle which makes fan go crazy...
3157,"Honestly, anything I try to think of as a good review for this movie seems to just come up short. This movie is the culmination of 21 previous movies over the past 11 years. This seems like an almost impossible task to try to do considering how much growth and development happened from movie to movie for almost every character. I was nervous when going to see this movie and not for the usual reasons of having anything spoiled for me or anything like that. I was nervous that this film would not be able to live up to expectations of being the end for some heroes while also being the beginning for others. From the very beginning of the movie, you are brought into the world where the snapped has happened and you feel as much sorrow and sympathy for everyone who survived but lost loved ones as they are feeling. This movie was nothing at all what I was expecting for a finale to the current Marvel Cinematic Universe and I loved every second of it. This movie has managed to be the perfect way for Marvel to pass on the torch to the next generation of Avengers. This is because it gives the perfect ending for those cast members who will be calling this their last movie as an Avenger and the perfect beginning for those who are seen as the future of the MCU like Captain Marvel, Black Panther, and Spiderman. I will definitely be seeing this movie in theaters at least one more time."
3158,Stan Lee himself would be proud of this very fitting end. I would find it hard to believe and find disgruntled fans. A true homage to all the MCU Universe.
3159,"Everything you wanted for a final movie, is packed in this epic movie called endgame."
3160,"I saw the first Marvel movie (IronMan I) when I was 12 years old. After that, I started to look forward to the following films (IronMan II, Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor, etc.) and I had already begun to realize that it was more than the films themselves. Now that I am 20 years old I can honestly say that EndGame was worth the wait and that perhaps in 10 years now we will not see such a great movie at this scale."
3161,"I enjoyed the film and there was a good mix of comedy, emotion and action. I get why some have said they were a little disappointed, but many are breaking the events down far too literally, I mean it is fiction guys.....Films like this rarely live up to the hype and this one could do with being 20 mins or so shorter."
3162,The best marvel movie yet.... So many emotions.... Chill and thrill.....
3163,"Superb actings made this movie epic There are lots of unexpected scences(amazing plot twists) which spoilers from social netwroks like facebook,instagram,twitter can't destory your excitement of watching this movie. You will see a best look of Stan Lee . Finally,End Game is woth watching"
3164,"The latest movie from Marvel Studio production that I watched in MX4D technology is an unforgettable experience. Finally, good is winning the evil. I'm a little sad because the victory was performed with the greatest sacrifice, but it must have been so! Fantastic movie to the end."
3165,"Topsy turvy. One minute you're happy, the next you're wondering why you're sad. Fantastic finish to an excellent group of films. Gutted it's all ended for this generation but times change I guess. It's been a long and emotional rollercoaster, enjoyable, gripping and funny when it was needed. I hope Captain Marvell remains the same and has more films ahead (because she is hot and we don't see enough of her). Meh. Don't know what else to say. Feels like the end of an era, which it is. Roll on the next generation."
3166,"For a movie with high score review and expecting to have a higher score than the Dark Knight for the MCU lovers, it's too standard although as concept is not bad."
3167,Movie of the century Love 3000 times. Every bit of the movie is a treat
3168,An cinematic master class and the perfection of epic journey comes to end with satisfaction. Thank you marvel. A MUST WATCH. IF YOU DONT ESE THEN WHAT ELSE YOU WILL DO.
3169,All MCU premieres are good but hats off to Sir stan lee for a remarkable ending.
3170,I luv Thor 😍😘😘😘2baar theater mn dekha..... It's totally mind-blowing
3171,This blew my mind in so many ways and exceeded all my expectations
3172,Awesommmmmmm it was more tha n expected its worth to see one time
3173,First Time i saw the movie in 3D. It was a great experience for me. It's awesome movie. I'm a big fan of MCU.
3174,"This movie was so great that i felt so bad that its over , i am really sad atm . but i want to say thx to everyone who helped making this movie ."
3175,The movie tied together 11 years worth of 22 marvel movies beautifully and managed to exceed my expectations. It put me through a roller coaster of emotions and truly deserves all the hype it is receiving. I loved it
3176,It's best movie ever but start from ironman... It will make you laugh cry at same time. I was crying because of love and fear and i spend last 40 minutes crying... I was satisfied
3177,Today was a great day because i watched this movie with my friends in the theater. It was a amazing experience see various heroes sharing the same universe. I almost cry in the last scene.
3178,"Thank you for 10 years of great entertainment! Loved all the 22 movies and can't wait to see the next 22. A great ending to a 2 part movie. All was 5 stars, ALL! Masterpieces! Will rewatch all, forever... AVENGERS!"
3179,"This movie made me feel every emotion humanly possible and then some. As a huge Marvel fan, not just of the movies, this film took me places! What a rollercoaster ride of emotions and the cinematography was beautiful. A very complex story made enigmatically seamlessly. Thank you to the Russo's! Can't wait to put this on the end of the canon once it's realized to purchase! A must watch in theaters!!! Best version of Hulk ever!"
3180,"This must be one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen. They tried to create humor, sadness but it was just pathetic."
3181,"This movie, pretty much, had it all...great action and drama...heroic valor...and comedy, in all the right places... plus there were great cameos...it's long, but it doesn't seem as long as it is because the pacing is very good... definitely recommeneded."
3182,Nice movie..best animations....love the whole movie
3183,It was the perfect ending a great made movie but captain marvel ruined the movie. Reason I gave this 8 was because it wasnt that entertaining which I thought it would be. Im also not the biggest marvel fan so dont @ .
3184,It was amazing. The hole movie was so good a would watch it again and again. WHAT a experience
3185,"The first Avenger's was amazing, the second pretty good, the third entertaining - but this final one was epic! With less characters in it (after what happened in the previous film) it didn't suffer from the same issue as Infinity War - too many characters that ended up being a little wasted.[換行字元][換行字元]A very fitting ending to the series - go see it now!"
3186,"This is the movie for which the whole world waited. We won't get an another movie like this for sure. Love, Emotions, Friendship , Goosebumps and fight scenes are perfectly scripted. One main theme is 'Sacrifice' yes it's needed in our real life too but we can't or won't bear it. This movie will be remembered forever especially as a fan with all our super heroes in it mainly Iron Man (Tony Stark). Love all the characters and the person who gave life to the characters..Stan Lee"
3187,RDJ is the only glimmer in a bland movie. Not worth the rating it got.. 5 at best.
3188,"I love you three thousand times,when i was a student I fell in love with Iron Man. sorry my English is not good, I can't express my feelings in words. 11 years ......[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you. My 11 years. Perfect. It's really done. I love you three thousand times. AVENGERS,ASSEMBLE."
3189,I gave this movie a 1/10... watch IMDB change it to a 10 Pay to play. Welcome to the real world.
3190,"Completely blown away by this movie. If there were any ""flaws"" to this movie, they hid them well. Should be nominated for best picture."
3191,"It's well plotted and it has the right amount of laughing situations, happiness, and disappointment. I have no words."
3192,"This is not just movie, it's beyond movie. It's the one movie that doesn't required any review, recommendations or feedback. Best comic book movie ever. MASTERPIECE! #endgame #dontspoiltheendgame"
3193,"As a fan of MCU, I loved it and anyone would but there are a lot of misconceptions in the film which I believe, make it flawed to me. Russos were almost out of content and they brought everything back which is beyond amazing. Of course, there were a lot of creativity issues. The Character arcs were at their best. Since I am not a hardcore Marvel fan, I gave it an 8 for its Visuals and fight scenes. The score wasn't as good as should've been. I expected a lot more after watching its trailers."
3194,"If you LOVE marvel movies, then you will absolutely be blown away by this one, like seriously just shaking in the theatre. If you aren't, you'll still think it's a great movie, just not as much as true marvel fans like myself. I was absolutely blown away by it, it was 3000x better than infinity war, best MCU movie ever. No correction, BEST MOVIE EVER. It was funny, action packed, heartwarming, satisfying, and also depressing in a way. I cried in the first scene in the movie, and then cried about 7 more times after that. If you're a marvel fan, you won't be able to control your excitement and pride in the third act of the movie, it's truly overwhelming. If you see it, you'll want to see it again and again and again. Thank you Kevin Fiege, for creating something truly spectacular.[換行字元][換行字元]Sincerely, Mitchel Fishman"
3195,Marvel made time travel a joke. It is kids time travel with no paradox. I was hoping a good story line. Worst marvel movie ever with no seriousness of each and every hero.
3196,"Screw shawshank redemption, godfarher, ... This movie is the best movie ever"
3197,Saw it in 3d otherwise it would have been terrible. Too many superheros for my liking.
3198,"Best endgame for The 10 years, you won't believe your own eyes and it's surpass of all the expectation.[換行字元][換行字元]Part of journey is the end.[換行字元][換行字元]""I am Iron Man"" -Iron Man/Tony Stark"
3199,"Just a guess, would it make sense to rerelease this film in an extended version , like in a month or release an extended version on Blu ray to fix all the sub stories not mentioned."
3200,"Excellent movie , Infinity war was a better superhero movie though ."
3201,"Welcome to Pin Point Review and let's keep it simple:[換行字元][換行字元]1) So much hate for spoilers: it's actually quite straight forward to me cos you can actually guess what's is actually going to happen.

3202,Absolute greatness done by marvel Everything about it is amazing
3203,I loved how it starts and how it ends. I can't put words into this. Totally worth the wait for 10 years for the whole MCU.
3204,"I understand that people really likes the movie, but in no world this movies is better or as great as the godfather, the dark night or pulp fiction. You all are overrating this movie"
3205,"This movie made all the previous MCU movies worth it,it's totally a master piece"
3206,"We already knew the story, the avengers trying to un-do what Thanos did in infinity war, for me this movie lacked of personality, I would have loved to see more relationship between characters, i liked the changes they did with some of them (Hulk), but there were characters that had insignificant appearances also. The pace was not that bad for the runtime, but in the middle of the film I was hoping to see more challenges for the characters, and more drama, it looked like the movie lacked of effort. For the budget they had, they should've done a very great movie. This one didn't surprised me, infinity war was way much better. Disappointing movie really."
3207,"Avengers endgame is the best movie ever. Acting, cgi, soundrack, story everything is perfect. The final battle is my favourite scene from this movie, The first hour is a little slow but it shows the avengers planing how to defeat thanos. I cried, laughted and felt proud that i'm a marvel fan. This is the best movie in the history and i will remember it and i will tell to my children and nephews for the infinity saga. The legend Stan Lee appears in a little scene in the movie. The best movie ever. 10/10"
3208,"Contrary to most, I left the movie theater with not much left of End Game inside me...[換行字元][換行字元]Despite giving a satisfying ending to a decade of greatness experienced in Marvel cinematic universe, and the battle scene is perhaps one of the best in recent years, the emotional journey of some key characters are sadly, not that emotional. They felt flat, which are pitiful as those characters deserve more recognitions and a better tribute. There exists some obvious plot holes as well, which did affect my experience watching the movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Can't deny that this is a very entertaining movie, however, like most Marvel movies, personally, I don't see this age well..."
3209,"Well before i start singing praises for Avengers:Endgame i would like to put it on the record that i don't think this was the best marvel movie yet. In fact , it falls short on multiple fronts from its predecessor - Infinity War. However , it managed to achieve something very rare - deliver a worthy,fitting conclusion to a magnificent series.[換行字元][換行字元]10 years and 22 movies , Marvel had turned itself into a routine for anyone who was even faintly familiar with the comics . With every movie , the expectations grew exponentially. Bringing together characters, so many of them, with huge fan following of their own, was a strenuous task . A few mistakes could turn the whole franchise upside down (#ahem DC anyone) and yet brick by brick, layers by layers Marvel made it all work. It was not without flaws of course , but the patience yielded results . So much so that some of the least favorite characters like our very own Captain America became one of the most loved idols.[換行字元][換行字元]In a way Avengers : Infinity War had a tougher job - to provide a necessary thrust . With that, Endgame then propelled the series to the heights never touched before. If you will look for plot holes and scientific inaccuracies , better save your breath - you will find many but what you will not find is a better homage to our loved characters than the one delivered by the Russo brothers.[換行字元][換行字元]It is true that the nostalgia weighs greatly behind all the craze surrounding Avengers : Endgame and it is this very nostalgia which prevents me to take a objective view regarding this movie. Avengers was a habit , a pleasant one which now has become a memoir . A big thanks to Marvel, the actors and countless others involved in making this a success and all I could say that every second and every penny i spent on their movies was without a doubt worth it , definitely worth it ."
3210,"Let me preface this by saying that I definitely belong in the ""casual Marvel fan"" category; so feel free to take this with a grain of salt.[換行字元][換行字元]I liked watching ""Endgame"". It was clearly the more emotional of the Infinity saga, the villain was better handled, and there were times when I was firmly butt-in-seat for whatever came next. Did it need to crash the 3-minute threshold? Good lord, no! I never glanced at my watch (which I guess says something) but it's not without its draggy segments. And as much as I wanted the team to get back at the bad guy and make things right, I was more interested in the time-travel, fan service and movie-hopping than I was in the big battle scene.[換行字元][換行字元]Don't get me wrong; I know this is a milestone. Ten years' worth of franchise-building capped in one movie; filling the imposing shoes of vanquishing Thanos; raking in a billion dollars. It was less escapism for me than it was witnessing history in the making. That much was palpable. And this a good movie, but it's hard to say if it lives up the unbelievable hype.[換行字元][換行字元]For me, it's questionable."
3211,Haven't seen the movie yet but I give a 10 cuz i want it to beat Dark Knight
3212,"Where Avengers 3 excelled in action, this one excels in boredom. The two are like day and night, the Ying and Yang of movies.[換行字元][換行字元]Infinity Wars:15 minutes of talk, the rest action. Endgame: 15 minutes of action the rest talk and selfpitty.[換行字元][換行字元]See this because you have to, not because of the inflated ratings.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers 3: 10/10 Avengers 4: 4/10"
3213,"This was a fun movie, but it was by means no where near a 10/10. Infinity War was a much better movie to be honest. It had way better action and a better story. End Game's plot was a mess. Overall, it was an entertaining and fitting end to an era, but was by no means perfect."
3214,"Marvel has completely taken over the film industry, and the addition of this film will speed up that process even more. This film is enjoyed the most when the audience is knowledgeable of the marvel cinematic universe and it enhances the emotions of the audience due to the bond forged through the commitment of watching all 21 films before Endgame. If someone were to ask me: ""Is it one of the best films you have ever seen?"" I would reply: ""It is the best film if all time, in its own way"" ""Its stands alone, away from every other film, because it is so different to anything i have ever watched before."""
3215,"I don't review movies often (if at all). But for this one, I'll make an exception. For all I know, maybe no one will read my review anyway, but here it is.[換行字元][換行字元]People cheering for this movie, calling it perfect don't really seem to see past the ending. The ending is good, but not great - the emotional impact wasn't really there for me. To explain why would potentially lead into spoilers, so I can't for now. However what ultimately brings the movie down for me are the plot holes of which there are many... I don't know how to explain more without going into examples/spoilers, so you would have to take my word for it... Also working against the film is it's runtime and it's pacing. It starts out very slow and at the end feels like a roller coaster going down after reaching the peak. There are a million things on screen to the point of fatigue and it starts feeling like visual noise...[換行字元][換行字元]Overall it's still a good movie, but I personally would like to watch it in privacy without a hundred or more teenagers making my head explode... So if you can, seek out a showing with the least amount of filled seats. ;)"
3216,"Mediocre Revamp of old stuff, waste of time, okay ending."
3217,You will never regret for watching this heroic movie
3218,This was the single greatest Marvel movie I've seen ever and it has everything that you could ever ask for in a finale.
3219,When you kill off two of the main characters the ones that weren't sjw and promote social Warrior BS I'm done. This was my end game don't waste your money your time those are two things it's hard to get back. And some sisters in the Marvel Universe none of us can go back in time what a joke.
3220,"What Endgame needed to be, was a movie that illustrated the love its makers had for not only the the movie itself, but far more importantly, for an entire decades' worth of journey. For the MCU to thrive for over a decade, was us, its fans, showing our commitment to this creation; what Avengers: Endgame needed to be, was the MCU's creator's turn, to demonstrate their commitment to us. What Avengers: Endgame needed to be, was a Love Letter 3000, to a fan base that followed it to the end of Time and Space, with our Minds and Souls, that allowed it the Power to touch our Reality.[換行字元][換行字元]That, truthfully, is a gargantuan task, so huge in fact, that if this film was a complete disaster, you would almost understand the inevitability of such an outcome. So with that said, did Feige, The Russo Brothers, and the MCU give us a Love Letter 3000?[換行字元][換行字元]The topic of time travel has always been a tall order, especially if your intention is to respect the science, while delivering an entertaining product. Endgame, did exactly that; though not perfectly, it did it with some level of perfection.[換行字元][換行字元]Trying to fit in story, reunions, suffering, action and sadly, goodbyes, was again always going to be a tough ask. Endgame at points felt rushed, but not because they were rushed scenes, but rather because, as a fan, personally, I wanted to linger that little bit longer in the moment, and I imagine most fans felt the same. However, rushed or not, the nods, connections and continuity that was displayed in this film, to accomplish everything from story to goodbyes, was handled with such care that, you can linger in that intention of attention.[換行字元][換行字元]So, with amazing attention to detail, a difficult story that was dealt with, professionally and passionately though not perfectly, a cast that can never really ever be forgotten, in a film that quite honestly, didn't feel like a film, but more like genuine adieu with a heavy heart, Avengers: Endgame leaves you asking for nothing more, except maybe: ""Do you really have to end?""[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you Marvel Studios, for your Love Letter 3000."
3221,"The MCU has meant quite a lot to me over the years, this is the franchise the more than any other shaped me into the film nerd that I am today and in many ways is the reason I do this at all. I still have my Iron Man poster that I bought in the cinema in 2008, just before my 7th birthday, back when I had no idea what an expanded universe was and a film as ambitious as this was just a pipe-dream for Kevin Feige.[換行字元][換行字元]With that being said it shouldn't too difficult to see how reviewing this film is pretty difficult for me. At the time of writing I have seen the movie once so here are my initial reactions, I'll try to stay spoiler free but if you want to go in blind I recommend avoiding all reviews.[換行字元][換行字元]This film is a complete mess, but in a good way. I can't think of a more fitting conclusion to this era of the MCU than to just mash all of the plot points together and just see what happens. At this point the MCU feels like a 90s comic run where to appreciate the grand narrative and subtle character moments you have to have read every previous issue plus all of the spin off issues about each individual character until you just give up entirely reread Watchmen. If you have ever successfully kept up with a comic like that then you know how satisfying it feels to read the issue where all of the character end up in the same place and fight the bad guy as a team. That is the feeling that Endgame gave me, satisfaction.[換行字元][換行字元]This is a movie for fans, not for film critics, thats is why I am so lost for words on this one. I would be lying to say that certain scenes didnt make me choke up a little and other didnt make me smile uncontrollably having had 11 years of context pay off in very entertaining ways. That being said the film lover in me has to point out the issues in the Russos directing style which comes to haunt much of this film, The Russo brother have too modes: funny and depressing. This works perfectly on Community with the episodes directed by them being some of the best sitcom episodes of all time (dont believe me watch the A Fistful of Paintballs / For a Few Paintballs More two parter). Here it can be jarring with hard cuts between scenes that are dark and grimy looking were the actors get to show of their dramatic skills to bright, lighthearted scenes of physical comedy and one-lines. Occasionally the writers slip in some great character moments into the more comedic scenes but if you already dont like Marvel humor then you might start to feel that run-time.[換行字元][換行字元]Those are really the only observations I feel comfortable giving this early without having seen the movie again or allowing time for others to see it. I think that the issues with tone will matter to me less once I see it again but it still needs addressed.[換行字元][換行字元]Really it should come as no surprise to you that I would say you should see this film and dont take my rating as gospel here (or ever) as I will probably change my mind on it later."
3222,"It is everything a Mavel fan would want. It got its comedy, epic battles, and a fair part of emotions. It gave a epic ending for all connected 22 Marvel movies. Thank you Stan Lee and Marvel Studios for this movie"
3223,I wish I could say more about this but my title says it all. Nothing wrong with a good mainstream movie but I rather sit on my toilet for three hours than watch this crap.
3224,"It might have just been a year since the mouth-opening climax of Avengers: Infinity War, It might have just been 7 years since the first Avengers film, when all 6 superheroes teamup, But it has been 11 years since the beginning of MCU. 11 years, 22 movies, 1 studio. is no doubt that the directors and the teams of visual effects and writing have put their hearts and souls into this masterpiece. The best thing about this film is that even though this movie is about 181 minutes long, it just doesn't feel like it and I was craving for more. They've given so much pressure and importance to character development this time, which felt highly unlikely in a Marvel film, and have succeeded unequivocally. We get to spend so much of the first half with our original Avengers and get to know their griefs. Avengers: Endgame can be described as the wildest, WILDEST dream of Marvel comics fan come alive. A decade ago, people thought of superheroes as ""people with powers"" and that was about it, but the 11 years of built-up have given each of these characters their own time to fight, to kill, to mourn and to finish, and this has bonded us to them, THIS is why we love Marvel movies, and this is also why we don't love DCEU films. At last, I would like to sign off by saying that ""don't be sad, because this may be the end of most of our beloved heroes, but there are several more to come..."
3225,"I must admit I was more excited than my 12 and 6 yr old kids . My wife made sure to catch up to all previous details Avenger movie before the movie day.We were very proud that we made into the movie so they expectations were sky high.I must admit the movie met those as we didn't realise when 3hrs were over. Movie overall has amazing CGI and interesting plot . MCU has kept correct balance in highlighting characters as per plot requirement and specially given some time for audience to understand aftermath since half of the population of all universal species vanished . Then some interesting twists , humour ,thrills , actions and emotional scenes as movie will progress . The whole 21 MCU movie saga is very well concluded in this Endgame movie. In fact while leaving cinema there will be a thought in the mind if MCU or any other movie venture could ever replicate this experience in future and will be satisfying feeling in mind that it is good I didn't miss first of this kind . Kids loved it , they kept chatting about movie scenes even after reaching home. Overall we loved it !"
3226,"Best superhero movie ever made, i laugh, i cried, it gave me goosebumps, just an outstanding movie, pure art by Russo Brothers, great ending for a great series, just want to thanks Marvel, Stan Lee, Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo for this amazing 11 years, Avengers is not just a movie for us, its an emotion, i grew up watching this. Endgame worth every penny ,every seconds , just bring tissue paper ,you will definitely cry. LOVE YOU 3000 TIMES!!!"
3227,Such great movie with just amount of ingredents. Sad that there won't be anymore. At least now we have amazing 6 hours long movie to watch over and over again.
3228,"It's more then a movie. Ah! finally the endgame. undoubtedly its the best of best movie in my life. i mean the epic cinematic universe have done an epic cinematic ending. i was laughing, i was crying, i was clapping i mean i can't control myself for till the movie is running. i can't describe my feeling about this movie. just go, watch this movie and witness an epic battle."
3229,"Part of the journey is the end - Tony Stark. I was not ready for the end. This movie made me feel those emotions no superhero movie has made me feel before, it even tops the non-superhero movies. I was speechless, teary-eyed, and worried after watching the movie. I am worried and sad because I know that it will never be the same again and I can't digest this fact."
3230,This movie is beyond the expectation. I think this statement is enough to get an idea without any spoilers that how is the movie.
3231,Mixture of events. Great effort. There was no need for that sad ending. They just did it to finish the series. It HAS AFTER CREDIT SCENES. Pay close attention to the sound you hear there ;-)
3232,I can watch this as many times as Doctor Strange did and I would cry over it again and again. Simply the best movie I've ever experienced. A perfect end to the beautiful franchise.
3233,"Avengers: Endgame is one of the most epic, intense, hilarious, heart-wrenching and oh-so-satisfying endings to a film series, and also one of the best films of all time. The direction and cinematography are amazing, the acting is phenomenal (namely Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlet Johansson and Jeremy Renner) and the music score is one of the best, most beautiful scores I've ever heard. This film is the second film to bring me to tears with Tony's death, and then funeral. The music and long shot of everyone there makes me want to bawl like a baby. Majestic, action-packed joyride. Go see it, even if you haven't seen any of the MCU films. It won't have as strong of an emotional connection, but it'll still be a good watch."
3234,"Avengers: Endgame, being the conclusion to an epic adventure, had to be perfect. Every Marvel movie from the last decade has contributed in making my expectations for this one incredibly high. Heading to watch it, I was as excited as anxious, considering it might not be as good as I thought it could be. However, the Russo brothers have been able to create a masterpiece by putting together every significant element from the MCU. This movie will be remembered, not only by fans, for years to come, whether it makes you smile, laugh, or cry![換行字元][換行字元]Thank you Marvel"
3235,There are so many ways that the movie could have gone. But it is chosen to be this way. So the climax should not be criticised. The story is completed with no proper explanation for the rest of the avengers. Other avengers are not given importance in most of the places. Don't go to the movie if you know the spoilers. My experience has been spoiled by my friends.
3236,"I have never created an account after so many years of coming here and reading reviews but felt It was time.Avengers: Endgame is incredibly emotional,action packed,hilarious and nothing short of Spectacular! Have seen it twice in 24 hours! Go see it,it's perfect!"
3237,"This is a movie for fans of the mcu. It's job is to essentially wrap up the last 21 films and it does so with a new and very different tone from the previous films. It is light in general tone with darker moments that all serve to bring as much emotion as they can. It is very much a character driven movie with few action scenes. (1 major one). People who who are invested in these characters and who have enjoyed the mcu fro the start will enjoy this. I have a feeling those who just want an action packed finisher to infinity war will be left feeling unfulfilled. Essentially, it is an emotional 3 hours filled with character development, humour and an end-of-term vibe and a great way of ending the mcu as we know it"
3238,"Before watching Endgame, I had doubts it will not be better than Infinity war. but it's not, the movie is tremendously good, emotionally and fantastic. everything from the first moment to the final scene is perfectly made. I wished those 3 hours never end. I enjoyed every single moment of this beautiful saga, Thanks MCU for the amazing dreams that we lived in such fascinating world."
3239,"In my 15 years of moviegoing. I've been shocked, i've laughed, cried, been terrified and surprized. But every movie falls short of theese emotions compared to this one. Absolutly amazing storytelling and the best action of any superhero movie plus an ending that won't dissapoint.[換行字元][換行字元]Amazing"
3240,"The movie starts slow, then picks pace. And then suddenly, the pace is zero.. Then, the pace starts to build up and it keeps on building. Until there comes a point, when it's just awesomeness.[換行字元][換行字元]Last One Hour is just Freaking Awesome. Last Half an Hour is just crying and Awesomeness again."
3241,"Hope 'endgame' means no more sequels. Story is so thin, the dialogues so silly and the melodrama painful that even the fine actors are not given a chance to show their abilities. What a marvellous waste ot time."
3242,"Normally there are a lot of plot holes in these kind of movies (the ones HISHE delve into and make you mad later) but other than one, I honestly can't think of any. The writers do an incredible job of tying up everything into exactly what the audience has been waiting for. You will laugh cheer and definitely cry, and it's all worth it."
3243,A must watch Movie The movie was way more than i had expected.Enjoyed it a lot.
3244,"Did i watch the same movie as everyone else? why are so many people leaving such high ratings for this movie? i guess it being the end of it factors in, but it just wasn't a good film. some good parts, but they take up like 3% of the film."
3245,"The film is fantastic from start to finish. Complete excellence all the way through. I feel emotionally unstable now though! It makes you laugh, it makes you cry. I'll be going to watch it again at least once more! It's everything and more."
3246,"I honestly can't understand how anybody could dislike this movie. It is without a doubt, one of the greatest films in history. Sure there were a few flaws, but no movie is perfect. From the character development to the action scenes to the comedy, it just succeeded all the expectations that it needed to."
3247,It was great. More than just an superhero action movie. Thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie.
3248,Just it it was great movie but there were weakness in the story no character development
3249,"SO many reasons to love this movies but so many more to just completely hate it. I mean, how many times can you just do whatever you like in a movie and have to explain it in the movie that it is okay because of this reason. What a joke. Also, the movie felt like a mixture of ten percent of ten different movies mixed into one and was just not fun to try to follow. In fact, after the most boring first hour in moviedom history, the movie just started to do stuff that felt like it was filmed before the story was even written or a script in hand. And please dont get me started on the Hulk, I wont spoil anything but will say that it was not a pleasure watching him become the weakest Avenger. This movie should have been cut down to about two hours - it would have still blown chunks but at least it wouldnt have been a sleepy third hour. The movie makes me wish that movies offered satisfaction guarantees and returns. I wouldnt have returned any of the snacks but I would have asked for my ticket money back. It stank. And finally, the biggest let down was the acting - these people get paid loads of money and their acting is stilted and boring. Well, enough - I must be wrong as it is making so much money. Sorry, don't see it."
3250,"This is definitely one of the best movie and the best presentation... I would recommended everyone to watch and dont listen others if overall is going more than 9 ranking, Its mean people's are not fool, definitely something is there. So go watch and than decide. And PLEASE DONT USE MOBILE AND DONT DISTURB OTHER WHILE WATCHING. You will love it."
3251,I don't know. I don't like it much. I think because after infinity war i expected much more from marvel! And i liked infinity war very very much.
3252,"This movie eclipses every single Marvel film to date, and is the most perfect ending as nothing lasts forever."
3253,"OMG... I haven't have had such an experience watching a movie as it took me down memory lane like crazy. I was laughing, crying, in a loop and was lucky to watch the movie without any spoilers...[換行字元][換行字元]So strongly urge everyone to not spoil the movie and let fans enjoy this amazing movie and culmination of last 11 years of marvellous MCU...[換行字元][換行字元]Please don't listen to negative reviews, as they might be either from hard core DCU fans who can't see Marvel success. ;) or people who just expect a Schindler list from Marvel, though it comes close to some of the most amazing and great drama movies of all time.[換行字元][換行字元]Nuff said, Fantastic movie..."
3254,This movie was a terrible mess from start to finish.
3255,"Went to a late showing last night and wow!!! This movie was amazing!!! Loved the plot and overall look of the film. The cast was amazing as always especially Chris Evan's, Chris Hemsworth, and Robert Downey Jr, they went above and beyond in this movie. You will laugh, cry, and yell in excitement over this film. Definitely Marvels Best!!!!!"
3256,"We all won after this movie. The audience won. Marvel won. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, they all won.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you Marvel."
3257,"The way this movie has ended the 11 long years of MCU need a huge round of applause... They couldn't have ended better. The way they satisfied millions of fans is quite a difficult task! But hail Russos, they did it yet again. The impact this movie has created will remain in one's heart for a long time... I think it's set it's standard so high that no other movie might even touch it for a long time!"
3258,"This perfectly ties the entire Avengers ""series"" together, with an ending that left me sad but content. Marvel does INCREDIBLE with every movie but this one hit different. If you haven't seen it yet, I suggest refreshing yourself with some past movies, obviously there are a ton of references and ties from the entire story."
3259,"If Infinity War was Back to the Future 1, Endgame is its 2nd and 3rd part. We get the same battle in a different time, previous scenes from previous movies, same scenes with different outcomes and a lot of satisfactory conclusions for the characters. It's not the same streamlined adventure the first movie was, but this will go down as the biggest obstacle our heroes ever overcame and that's what you will remember in time."
3260,"The hype held up, if you are a marvel fan you will love this end to the cinematic universe."
3261,"Endgame is not just a movie. It is an experience. For the fans who have been following all these beloved characters for over a decade, this is the a perfect ending that brings the whole story to a full circle. This is a love letter to the loyal fans of this franchise. You will laugh, you will cheer, and you will cry harder than you ever did. I have never seen anything like it, and I don't think I will. Thank you Marvel for bringing us on this journey."
3262,"As of now, after about 100K reviews the average user rating for Avengers: Endgame sits at 9.2. Infinity War, after about 620K, has an 8.5. I like where this assessment stands and hope it doesn't change much, as more user ratings flood in.[換行字元][換行字元]I point this out for all the negative reviews citing how Infinity War was far superior to Endgame and that Endgame was such garbage and flawed. This is without a doubt a case of the criticisms saying much more about the critic than what they are saying about the film. Perhaps their own disposition and attitudes prevent them from a positive perception. They are certainly entitled to their pretentiousness and to feel cheated, but their petulance is their OWN responsibility. Much to the chagrin of this minority, the majority has not only embraced what Endgame is, but for the time being placed it above Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]I say this because I tire of the arrogance and contempt in people that behave as though they could have written or produced a better result than what they paid to see. Many of those that love to review or critique, think it en vogue or trendy to be incredulous, negative, or never be satisfied.[換行字元][換行字元]I'm happy to see that the majority of viewers were satisfied and more than content with Avengers: Endgame. IMO, complaining and rating the film sub par requires a great amount of cynicism and disenchantment. IMO, if you allow plot holes or whatever other discrepancies found in the film, to ruin it or leave you sour and disappointed, then you probably tend to create your own misery in life in life anyway.[換行字元][換行字元]There's nothing wrong with having a personal opinion or particular disposition. I do however think it important to put disillusionment and negativity in its proper place, to achieve objective perspective. So again, according to imdb user review, Infinity War is at 8.5 and Endgame is at 9.2 and holding. I'll check back on the consensus in a few months after further reviews."
3263,"The title Endgame fits pretty well to the conflicts the protagonists find themselves in. They fight not only Thanos, but also need to handle their deep (inter-) personal problems of loss and how to go on after having lost almost everything in Avengers - Infinity war. Each protagonist has its own individual storyline. In general this movie is much more than a simple action movie, it has (very) sad parts, funny and stunning moments where you are just fascinated and overwhelmed. The storytelling is intelligent and surprising at the same time. There are several unpredictable plot twists, on the other hand also some minor plot holes and open questions that the movie does not answer. The movie in a very smart way connects all previous MCU movies and lends them to a well-deserved conclusion. I give this movie 9 stars as it was brilliant entertainment and storytelling. Only in one Marvel movie before the time was flying so fast and that was Infinity war. Go and watch it yourself and make your own judgement! You will most likely not regret it for one minute!"
3264,"A perfect reflection on the last 11 years that pays off everything in the best way possible. Perfect blend of action, heart & humor. It's kind of the ultimate gift to the fans of MCU. Truly an achievement in blockbuster film making. Congrats to all for pulling off the feat![換行字元][換行字元]Greatest superhero movie EVER!!"
3265,"The final part of the culmination of all the MCU movies couldn't have been executed better.. Before the smartest guys in the milky way start talking about the loopholes in the time travel theory let me tell you that this is a comic book movie and not a time travel documentary so please take it with a pinch of salt.. Having said that, the movie gets a lot of science right and the best part is the storyline, related Easter eggs and references to the previous movies and the sheer comic book on a larger than life magnitude that makes this movie the best comic book movie ever made... This is pure gold..."
3266,"My first review, as this movie totally deserves it.[換行字元][換行字元]I think Infinity war and Edgame are both amazing movies. Nowadays is hard to make a movie and satisfy everyone, as people have extremely high expectations and we are being so spoilt. Some people saying that Infinity War was better, but cmoon.. its so hard to make something even better than Infinity War. But i think MCU did an amazing job with Endgame."
3267,I want to give it 10 stars but the fact that it has to force some political views (ex. The clearly forced all female Avenger scene) means it doesn't deserve a 10 star rating.
3268,"This movie is amazing ,wonderful, superb..... All character are very good and good acting. Tony stark is amazing acting.all about are very good."
3269,"This film All In One. God!!! Can you imagine??? Made me love one character after watching this movie. The first marvel film, i love it. That hero never gonna replaced!!![換行字元][換行字元]Love this movie so much, maybe my favorite movie my whole life![換行字元][換行字元]xoxo"
3270,"Before reading this, I just request you to take two minutes and think of best possible conclusion to this 22 movies saga. Thought of one? Now multiply the awesomeness of your ending by a 100 times and still this movie will surprise your assumptions! If a critic like me who just can't stop finding errors in a movie failed in finding big mistakes in this movie, I think you should believe this one is just perfect! Sure there were a few tweaks, but I am ready to ignore them seeing how smoothly the whole 3 hours of the runtime just passed by. I was literally sticked to my seat for 3 hours, even during the interval, I was like I want to see the whole movie in one length. Tell you the truth, I was not much impressed with Infinity wars or Ragnarok (not even mentioning captain marvel here xD), but Russo brothers just nailed this one. After waiting for 21 movies, we deserved a perfect end, and we got one. 10/10 from my side. If 21 movies lead to this, I am ready to watch another set of 21 for such a perfection!"
3271,"This movie is not just a superhero Marvel movie, it's far beyond. It's a 3 hour ride, a roller coaster, during this time you won't be able to get bored even for a second, but you will be glued to the screen a bit scared to lose any word said or fraction of scene. I can say for sure that this it the most amazing, fun, creative and beautiful production ever made in cinema, yes, so much so. The script, acting, twists, action, drama number of movie-stars and actors etc are so good and coordinating so well, that even I who saw any good movie ever made was surprised. It's such a beautiful movie, with a deep dive into the soles of the main characters, and there is a build up for that part from the moment the movie begins, it's not the typical Marvel movie you have seen before, it's much more about friendship, love, family and other human values that matters in life more then anything, that matters, and that gives the Avengers their real power, superheros are actually more human then humans, they have their powers but it's the values that bring them together and make them the best they can be. Will take years to any movie to be made to be as good or more, the last one I recall is The Dark Night, then Infinity War, and now it's this one that creates a new benchmark in this genre, and in cinema in general. This movies ties-up all the prior Marvel movies into one grand ending. Satisfaction guaranteed 10/10."
3272,Nothing special. It was boring. I'd rather watch the phantom menace.
3273,"It's just great, I don't want to spoil anything, just trust me. But to make it even better, watch the first iron man and captain America: the first avenger again if you already have or for the first time (and obviously you have to have seen infinity war, but you don't need to rewatch it if you have already seen it)"
3274,The first and second act is an absolute love letter to the MCU movies that came before this one. The third act is an emotional roller coaster ride of nerdgasms and cry time which i never thought i will see and feel from a supper hero movie. The final scene hits home big time.[換行字元][換行字元]If you are not very familiar with the MCU the first two acts may feel a bit slow for you. But the payoff in the third act is just awesome.
3275,My 1st ever review. 9 is an absolute disrespect to a masterpiece. Yes. It's that great.
3276,The movie will give u chills throughout.....it is the best movie.......loved it!!!!
3277,All around amazing. A beautiful ending that felt not only like a proper wrap up to everything we have seen in the MCU so far but also opened so many doors for the future. This will be at the top (at least top 3) of everyone's marvel movie rankings.
3278,"Dissapointing and too long...Basically,only the ;last hour was watchable... Previous entries were much better."
3279,"I will not call it a fitting ending.. but it was definitely beautiful. The movie ensures that every character is given enough space, but not too much. The ending battle is epic! But what stole my heart was the credits. It's a must watch for the franchisee fans."
3280,"This roller coaster ride was by far Marvel's best movie, yet. It may have best the best movie that I have ever seen in any genre. Looking at the list of movies I have seen, over 1000, I can't put my finger on one that provided the cohesive story and emotional ride that Avengers: Endgame provided."
3281,"The best ever superhero movies.. Don't listen the haters ""DC Fans"" Please go watch yourself that MASTERPIECE, BEAUTIFUL, EPICMOVIE"
3282,"To everyone involved in this production, especially the 6 OG Avengers you really did the fans proud. This was a great ending to a story that has gone on for 22 films. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans really brought their A game. Chris Hemsworth never ceases to amaze regarding the flexibility of Thor. Thank you all for creating the ideal celebration not only to your characters arcs but for the fans as well. The Avengers will be missed!"
3283,One of my favorite movies. I was always interested in what was going on even though it was three hours long.
3284,Endgame had some quality acting by the main cast and some mediocre at best from the supporting cast. There were bits in the movie were it was slow and unentertaining. The story during the middle section felt like it was dragging along. Other then that the movie was good
3285,"Though the previous movie was much better, this one is still an amazing one. Infinity War had just set the bar too high and I don't think any movie, in the history, could've ever fulfilled those expectations. But still, endgame is a flabbergasting film and a must watch."
3286,A great ending to a saga that gave me happiness in many different ways. thank you for all these years of work to reach this perfect end
3287,"Redundant plot, unnecessary long, unexplainable events and meaningless humour!"
3288,"Let's star by saying the Russo brothers made their part, they really work and made the movie work with all the caotic scenes that involve so much characters at a time, unfortunately the care of surprise, so much of their scenes can be read from the first second making not surprises, so what happen to the characters is nothing new at the time they happen ( that an all the clues they have been giving before the movie) made most of the movie a predictable one, maybe because marvel has fall into a self repeating formula, in Wich the jokes are lazy ( really, really lazy) and some time even disruptive, so it doesn't work all the time with the climax. then it comes to make Thor as a total clown ever since from ragnarok, is just simply annoying to watch. that and Hemsworth's inability to cry in the movie are the worst part of all. But at the end is a good movie, a good clousure for the phase, with great special effects, some nice adequate music and an afterall enjoyable movie, even Whit all the aspects that, at least for me, damaged the movie"
3289,"I was expecting this movie for a long time and i was sure that since the last 3 avengers movies were good ,that this one will be the best , they even compared it to dark knight... but no, itt wasn't. The flow of the movie was very slow and uneven, 2 whole hours introduction for 30min of action and suspnce.. when the action finaly came i couldnt even be excited.They tried to create emotions, but you can't force that ,when yoou devote your 2 first hours to nothing. It has soem great scenes and it wasn't so awful but i excpected much more from the closing movie of avengers with not so many plot holes..."
3290,It could be takes the crown of no.1 worldwide. A second chance to make things right.
3291,I thought this was the perfect way to end the game. This movie is the best of all the Marvel movies and is emotional and funny at the same time. It was a great ending to the era and a movie you won't regret seeing.
3292,"The only way to explain this movie is ""Cognitive Dissonance"". Its foundations are fundamentally cracked with the best plaster covering it.[換行字元][換行字元]The Good? Most of the Characters are given satisfactory closure and/or sequel-fuel, in particular Tony, Cap, Thor and GOTG. The Visuals are amazing and breathtaking. Actions Scenes have large pay-offs for series veterans. Highly emotional and atmospheric.[換行字元][換行字元]The Bad? The film introduces too many plot threads, then it is attempting to close pre-existing ones. Some of the humour doesn't work. Thanos lacks the development that IW gave him.[換行字元][換行字元]The Ugly? The main plot gimmick is non-nonsensical. Thor is just awful."
3293,"The end is here, and with it, the most satisfying conclusion the universe has ever seen"
3294,Great movie ! So much in the end and the flashbacks made it all make sense. All 22 movies and they end with this. Great movie
3295,"Let me start this review by stating that I fully admit being 100% in awe of the MCU and everything it has achieved and am completely biased in my opinion.[換行字元][換行字元]Now, on to the movie, it is simply perfection. My anticipation going into this film was off the scale, after being invested in this franchise for over a decade and being a massive fan of the larger Marvel universe for most of my life I can guarantee that if you are a fan, you will not leave the cinema dissapointed. Action, humour, romance, drama, tension, horror.... this movie has it all, it fills you with joy and a sense of hope one minute then rips through you with fear and loss the next, it is the ultimate roller coaster filled with so many twists and turns that you will be gasping for breath on the (bleeding) edge of your seat, it is the most fitting conclusion to an epic tale but also a fitting beginning to a continuing story. Stunning effects, outstanding script, enthralling storyline and above all superbly acted by a cast that truly appear to believe in their characters and understand their audience like never before (Hawkeye anyone!!!). I cannot stress enough how much love and care has gone into creating this epic masterpiece and do not say lightly that I hope the academy takes note come awards season.[換行字元][換行字元]The Russo brothers deserve huge praise, along with the rest of the crew, the way they have taken this franchise and crafted it into a sublime piece of pop culture that will go down in history as one of the greats is not to be sniffed at, my only hope is that the next 10 years expand and enhance it even further.[換行字元][換行字元]I wish I could keep the feeling of watching it for the first time forever, what an experience, what a movie, what a time to be a fan![換行字元][換行字元]Loved it 3000."
3296,"So i've already watched this film at cinema. yeah actully in first day , but the tickets sold out and i came in second day . soo i was cry .not cry bad ,but in my heart this film is touching u know , u knew bout the war ,and things , and this is the end of avengers . thank u :)"
3297,Feeling cheated after watching the movie at high rate ticket. nothing new same action. worst movie of avengers series.
3298,"I am quite amazed at the lack of original content in this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]They manage to recycle about 50% of infinity war into this movie. Isn't that just lazy?[換行字元][換行字元]They could have easily cut 1 hour of meaningless content and add 15min of explaination for the random things that happen with no context.[換行字元][換行字元]They road mapped the movie in the first 15min so no real surprises.[換行字元][換行字元]Acting was good.

3299,I have seen this couple of time but still I can watch over and over again.
3300,"I 100% didn't feel that this movie is 3h long, Though this will be good to watch at home, Endgame is one of those movies that was made to be a cinema experience, in 3D or not (but it was better in 3D). I believe in most of the developments and paths the characters chose. For a movie with so many characters and converging plots, Endgame doesn't feel too packed."
3301,"Except last 30 minutes, the whole movie is so lame. Bad writing. One of the worst movies Marvel ever made."
3302,"When people come here to see a review they don't want to know the ending of the darn movie.My advice is to read no further reviews and get off this site now unless you want the whole movie ruined. The movie is really good, but you'll probably have to watch it twice to understand everything and it helps not to have someone sitting literally on the edge of their seat in front of you the whole movie with their head in view on the screen ARGGGGGGGG!"
3303,"Seious,sad,funny,legendary,epic,historic Best villain, Best Characters, Best Actions, Best Momments!"
3304,High hopes for this one but a bit of a let down Im sorry to say.
3305,"One of the main reasons why this movie is only a 7 is because of the super high expectations and how excited I was for this. So for me it was kind of a let down but not just because of the hype. Personally the pacing was just God awful, and it's not because it's a little slow to start, but it's the massive amount of jumps the film takes. I can watch slow movies with a build up, but when everything changes so quickly and then goes back to slow repetitively it creates an frustrating feeling. The movie also has many unexplained plot holes, with most movies this is fine, but when you need to know the details (which are very important for marvel films) then it hits the plot a lot. I also feel like the movie tried too hard to be emotional. There was no need for the way it ended or the sad spots in between. Not to mention, the cgi on captain marvel looks great. Still a good better then average movie, but not the best ever."
3306,"You wont miss anything entertaining. I didnt know what to expect from this final film, but I certainly wasnt expecting to watch arguably the slowest moving Marvel movie ever made. Does it make up for it in that one epic fight scene? not really. So many other movies have done epic battles far better than this. Now I cant sleep properly cuz I got so much rest during Endgame!"
3307,Go see it. It's definitely worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3308,"I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words.[換行字元][換行字元]I'm not your average fanboy -- most long-running franchises have bored me at this point, and I couldn't care less about the newest Star Wars episode or whether there will be another film set in the Harry Potter universe.[換行字元][換行字元]But Marvel films have been consistently watchable, with many solid entries and a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed![換行字元][換行字元]Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame is one of them. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. It's hard to see how they'll be able to top this one.[換行字元][換行字元]It's surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there), emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I've laughed in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok). Visually speaking, it's a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the 'epic battle' stakes), and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my watch was because I was hoping there would be more time before the end.[換行字元][換行字元]Yes, it's a superhero movie, but an immensely entertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the pictures that came before it: there are tons of references and inside jokes to reward the faithful).[換行字元][換行字元]If ""Return of the King"" managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars Avengers: Endgame deserves at least a nomination.

3309,What an amazing movie marvel have really use the power of it's own movie if every mistake in the others movie was just to give us these amazing moving picture then I will give all marvel movie he same rate.
3310,Emotional😢.... 😋Funny Dialogue... SmashinG SmashinG & SmashinG...
3311,"I have watch this movie and really it is really the ""ENDGAME"" movie for all marvel movie since iron man in 2008. Wow, cant imagine thats already has been 11 years from that first MCU movie. Last word, FANTASTIC :)"
3312,With some misfortunes but an amazing script and a wonderful interpretation of part of the actors
3313,"The action is outstanding but for me there was missed opportunities with some stuff and wasted screen time for other bits, 100% worth a watch but still way below Winter Soldier."
3314,"I want to thank everyone, everyone who had touch with the creation of this phenomenal film. You should look."
3315,Don't miss this great epic movie. It is full of fun and great battle.
3316,"It seems like there's always a big Movie Event nowadays, like the last Lord of the Rings movie, the last Harry Potter, or the first Stars Wars movie in forever. Each of these movies packs a huge emotional wallop as we see the culmination of story arcs we've been following for several years. With the Avengers, we've been following these arcs for ten years (and now 22 films), and Endgame had the unenviable task of following the cliffhanger of its immediate predecessor. How will the Avengers reverse the Decimation? Well, for starters they'll do so in a three-hour-plus movie - and they'll need every minute, too. But the road to redemption is not a straight one at all, and if you thought that the final scenes in other franchises were powerful...well, in Endgame they happen very frequently. How emotional is this movie? Bearing in mind that it's a comic book movie, not a Hallmark movie, one wouldn't expect only the broadest of 'heavy' scenes, and yet in Endgame these scenes seem to occur every few minutes. How emotional? It used to be that people would rate melodramas based on the number of handkerchiefs they needed to wipe their tears or blow their noses. For Endgame, I'd say it's a five hankie movie, but only if one reuses one's hankie a lot. I counted twelve tear-inducing scenes. 12! But the franchise has always depended, to some degree, on surprises, and luckily for me nothing was spoiled beforehand. In Endgame, we see many, many character arcs completed one way or another. The movie is exceedingly satisfying and emotional draining. It is far and away the finest comic book movie I've ever seen, and I hope it joins Black Panther in garnering itself an Oscar nomination or two next year. There isn't a single moment in this movie that misses a step, no single overwrought or drawn-out scene. There is just moment after moment of awesomeness. Even if you have just a vague idea of what the plot is or who the Avengers are, you probably won't watch this movie without feeling something magical. The characters are well written and exceptionally well played. The action is exhilarating. The ending is cathartic. It's very worthwhile to see this in a theater, too."
3317,"If you are a Marvel fanatic,watched all the movies and were actually looking for a culmination,You must have enjoyed it a whole lot. But as a standalone,this movie was not at all worth it. Considering all the hype and marketing,this movie was boring. Way too long and was tedious in the first half. It picked up in the second half but wasn't enough to compensate,It relied way too much on humour and the progression was painfully slow. Me,not being a Marvel fan and after watching just few movies of the series stands disappointed. It was inferior to infinity war for me. Just my 2 cents"

3319,"Breathtaking. Endgame raises the bar so high. The emotion, comedy and action all combined to produce a movie of epic proportions that probably won't be matched for many years to come! The best MCU movie. Easily one of my all time Top 5 favs."
3320,"Avengers: Endgame is the eagerly awaited one, has a good amount of emotions in it, making you highly emotional in the final scenes.[換行字元][換行字元]It is very effective, though it takes momentum in the final hour, building the story in the first half.To read full click Here"
3321,I could not have imagined a better ending and a more befitting climatic scene to what took place. Amazing movie! 10 🌟 s
3322,"This is perhaps one of the biggest movies of all time if not THE biggest film of all time! Avengers endgame is a stunning love letter to fans of the MCU, and will truly leave an impact on the whole movie industry. The movie is just so spectacular that I can't even cover everything with mere words in this review. Infinity War was spectacular but this movie is the one that for the last 12 years has been built up to. There are plenty of Easter eggs and references to the past movies that true fans will understand. The acting is great from all involved and the visuals are incredible. This movie is quite an emotional ride, and it will have you going through a whole range of different emotions and it's 3 hour run time. I can't say enough for this movie, just be prepared for your heart to be racing Non-Stop! I don't want to spoil anything because there is just so much to spoil for those who have not seen it yet. This movie will be talked about for many many years, and there will never be another quite like it."
3323,"I'm not giving you spoilers: this was everything you expected and hoped for. This is the most satisfying and inspiring end. This masterpiece brings you joy, tears, excitement and so much more. You definitely have to see it. When I first saw it Wednesday night, I was so overwhelmed that I've decided to see it again this Thursday!!"
3324,I think this movie are better than the avatar itself and the other one is a bit more
3325,For a 3hr film it flies by. Ties up the MCU nicely and the best film I have seen in a while. Highly recommend
3326,I dont know any movie that had a 3rd act better then this... the final battle made me feel like i was on 100 pounds of cocaine
3327,I really like the movie and the stories about the heros!

3329,"I think fans have waited for enough to see the avengers, this point we thank the late Stan Lee by sharing this story he created, for first time viewers how had not seen any pervious avengers movies this is not to watch until see all the movies from the start."
3330,"Very good movie. Kind of goofie with the time travel stuff. The cringe worthy segments I had heard about were not that bad, and Captain Marvel did not ruin the movie as feared. Will be seeing this one again."
3331,"It was just amazing! Incredible, epic, emotional, action-packed and awesome! I wonder how it will all go on after this... Not since the wnd of Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings have I been so excited for an ending saga. I can't wait for what is next. An all female Avengers? Hopefully!"
3332,"From the opener scene to the final fade to black this is an outstanding way to end the journey - so far - of the Avengers.[換行字元][換行字元]Funny, brutal, emotional and thought provoking this has been crafted together by people who really care about the fates of these characters.[換行字元][換行字元]Absolutely awesome"
3333,"Ha,Deep inside,the Marvel fan was weeping,but he knows this is the showdown!❤💖He knows what it takes to move on,without Them🖤He knows that part of the journey is the End💐Thank You,Avengers!"
3334,"This is hopefully the end of this long standing, inconsistent, money spinning series. And it's also the worst of them all. First hour or so...one or two fight scenes. The rest is back slapping in jokes that you'd have to memorise all the other films to get, long drawn out pointless 'science' scenes or 'hilarious' takes on each characters' past dislike of each other (didn't two used to fancy each other? It's like that never happened), and oh yeh the characters all change...like all the time. Remember when this one was bad and this one was good? Not anymore! And what is with their hair?! At the initial meeting to discuss the film concept did someone just say ""hair. Too benign. Let's jazz that up a bit"" because it's as if one of the Avengers is Vidal Sassoon all of a sudden.[換行字元][換行字元]This should be buried in a pit for future generations marked ""stop watching after Age of Ultron"""
3335,"Without throwing any spoiler I would say that it was obvious that it won't be a happy ending movie but the expectation that we had for this movie was sky high. Whatever you're expecting, you would find much more in the film. Truly epic & and the nearly perfect ending to a long journey but it does not mean we wont see anymore Avengers Movie in future. It not a conclusion for the entire Marvel series but it defiantly concluded some of our favourite heroes journeys. Go and experience this masterpiece you won't regret it."
3336,"I see why the critics like it. It's about love, loss, epic battles, second chances and the triumph of good over a great evil. Not of course, without a great sacrifice. Epic."
3337,"Having grown with these characters, seeing the culmination with all the interactions, the fight sequences and the heartfelt moments, it all culminates in a film that is just beautiful."
3338,The movie that you just want to watch again and again and again until eternity
3339,"Well, it finally happened: I got emotional during a Marvel movie. Sorry, not sorry. This film truly was a fitting conclusion to a decade of MCU films. While it was a classic action sequel, it was also filled with surprises, homages, laughs, and emotional moments. Unfortunately, that's a LOT to accomplish in one movie (hence the 3 hour runtime). Fortunately, almost all of it worked. They wanted to bring 22 movies to an epic climax...mission accomplished. I'm not sure that I would put this one alongside the best stand alone MCU chapters (Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Ragnarok, Iron Man, etc.), but it somehow pulled all those movies together in a pretty magical way. I complain a lot about the comic book-ification of film, but I can also recognize the accomplishment that is the MCU."
3340,"Wow, just Wow! This movie has it all and needs to be watched PERIOD!!"
3341,"It is a nice film,I enjoyed it alot,a perfect end to great saga,10 years of job did it well"
3342,"Helt utrolig fantastisk. Mye action, mye humor og litt trist."
3343,"Though I am not the biggest fan of Marvel movies, I can say without a doubt that this had the most epic finale in a movie ever. This was not a movie. This was an experience, an event. This was a fantastic end to a decade of generation-defining super hero movies. This was a movie to remember. Also, the credits were very touching (it may be a weird note, but they are great).[換行字元][換行字元]Though I will say this movie was a little too long, and Thanos felt a little less emotional real than he was in Infinity War. Also, it was very overwhelming in scope for such a long time, I was actually dizzy afterwards."
3344,The best superhero movie ever made.....Thank you marvel for such an amazing movie...I'm proud to be a Marvel fan
3345,This movie was so damn satisfying that I was watching it with such interest that my eyes started paining. A marvelous Marvel film exceeding our expectations.[換行字元][換行字元]WE ARE IN THE ENDGAME NOW!

3347,Wow!! Hype is REAL!! The best superhero movie EVER!! Period.
3348,One of the best movie ever made 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔😭💔💔😭💔😭💔😭
3349,"Brilliant movie. What a climax! They did a good job in concluding the Avengers series. 10 on 10! Must watch. I laughed, was speechless and even cried."
3350,How on earth did this average kind of movie managed to beat the AVATAR !!!!!!!
3351,"I'm going to put this without any spoilers. This film was awesome. One of the best films ever made. I thoroughly enjoyed it, didn't feel like 3 hours at all."
3352,Overlong and cheesy in the extreme. As a massive Avengers fan I was disappointed in the film. Who on earth decided to portray Thor as an overweight bloated drunkard?..That person should be hit with Thor's hammer. In a way I am glad that it has come to an end. It had become a money making machine at the expense of high octane adventure. Yes I will miss it but maybe not as much as I should!!!

I wanted it to be everything i'd hoped for, i wanted it to live up to the gargantuan hype, but unfortunately it falls short and in essence 'fails nonetheless' (to quote Thanos) The final fight was good, but again nothing more I do not wish to include spoilers so i'll say this: This was not EPIC Some people thought so[換行字元][換行字元]But not us #DontspoiltheEndgame"
3355,"Great movie and the film will not be too melancholy, so terrible, of this new world of Marvel's wish to produce films like that."
3356,It's an epic.emotional and exciting movie You will laugh you'll cry and you'll get extremly excited.that's unbelieveble.I loved it 3000
3357,"Avengers - Endgame offers a stunning and moving ending. There are times to laugh, but also times to cry. Many did at the end. Thank you Marvel."
3358,"I just went to see the Avengers Endgame on Apr 25th, in Hawaii.[換行字元][換行字元]First, I have to say......it was a good solid movie. However, it did not touch me or speak to me.

3359,"Endgame is one of those movies that comes out once a decade. It is a must see movie but if you are new to the MCU then you might want to catch up before attending this movie. Otherwise it won't be worth the ticket to see this movie because you won't understand any of it. At the same time the visual effects and master cinematography is worth the watch even if you don't understand anything that is happening. That is why I am giving it a 8/10 because the story is good but there are many other stories within the MCU itself. Overall, it was a solid movie that appeals to fans but if you aren't a fan who has seen all the other movies there might be parts that will be lost on you."
3360,"I cannot believe the roller coaster of emotions that this movie is. You have to watch it, you have to. Is the movie of 2019."
3361,"What an incredible motion picture.

3362,The epic conclusion of Marve's MCU franchise helds with Avengers Endgame which deeply fullfills every desire a marvel fan will want. No.1 in the world
3363,"Such a beautiful way to end such a fantastic series...or, rather, to end this chapter. Marvel has really outdone themselves and no other film could put that many avengers/superheroes on one screen and make it that good. I hope you haven't spoiled the movie for yourself if you are at all hesitant...whether it be fear of disappointment or not wanting to sit there for 3+ hours. Anyone that has kept up with all the movies will be blown away. Thank you Russo Brothers for making such a beautiful film."
3364,"Endgame became the closing and satisfying climax that managed to answer the expectations of loyal MCU fans. Filled with various epic actions and battles, Avengers: Endgame offers a watching experience that cannot be missed."
3365,"Not going to go into any spoilers I just felt that overall the movie was average, it did a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong. The acting was decent, the action scenes were good if few and short and the pacing wasn't atrocious.[換行字元][換行字元]But there were flaws, Brie Larson could have been replaced by a cardboard cut out, some of the twists made little sense and the big fight was rather unsatisfying and had a really cringy scene (you'll know it when you see it)[換行字元][換行字元]Ultimately it's worth watching but the people rating this a 10 are overly hyped or wearing blinders because there were more than enough flaws evident throughout the movie. Basically go in expecting an alright action flick and you'll enjoy it."
3366,One of the best hollywood movies ever been made. Was curious to watch the film since the first trailer was released and it is worth all the hype. Well done russo brothers and the cast of avengers endgame

I straight up didn't understand some of them, and none of them did I genuinely enjoy the whole way through.[換行字元][換行字元]Except this one. This one is different. It is the only one that made me care about anything that was happening. Spending a lot of time on story/emotional development in the first hour made me care about what happened the last two.

3369,"After 'the vanishing' in Infinity War, there were still a handful of superheroes left knocking about to try and restore order to the universe, but in Endgame the real hero is a rat. A lowly rodent scampers across the controls of Hank Pym's quantum machine, activating a few switches with his little ratty feet, bringing Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) back from his five-year stay in the quantum realm. And it is Lang's return that kick-starts a desperate attempt to reverse Thanos' nefarious handiwork.[換行字元][換行字元]If you can swallow such lazy writing, then you'll no doubt have no problem with the rest of the film, which resorts to that old chestnut - time travel - with all the paradoxical problems that arise as a result. Unfortunately, I struggle to let such things slide, annoyed by rather casual approach taken by writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, whose script scampers lightly over the temporal issues like a rat over a console (I'm sorry, I just can't let that go). While the film is undeniably enjoyable as a slam bang piece of mega-budget entertainment, it isn't as flawless or as clever a denouement that one might hope for.[換行字元][換行字元]Visually, Endgame is hard to beat and it's great to see all of the A-list stars of the past MCU movies coming together for one last effects-filled battle (it's amazing what $400,000,000 can buy), but for the culmination of a twenty-two film series, I had dearly hoped for something a bit more considered and fulfilling than a great-looking movie that is ultimately dependent on the actions of a rat (yes, it irritated me THAT much...)."
3370,They couldn't give every hero equal billing (they tried with Antman & Captain Marvel which is the minus one star) so they made the movie all about the original Avengers from 2012 and...the movie does not disappoint. Couple of 'wow' moments with a generous sprinkling of sweet tender moments throughout. The best finale anyone can ask for and a fitting curtain call for the original Avengers. Kudos and a big THANK YOU to the Russo brothers!
3371,"I really love Marvel, this is a perfect movie and I'm going to watch it many times. Best movie ever. And a recommend it 1000 times over. Thank you brothers Russo for this unforgettable experience. Thank you Avengers actors you are the best <3"
3372,Unlike any other films about villains this film is what a hero does and most fascinating story told ever. How could it be directed differently after 21 films conclusions? Just hail Marvel! Not revealing the cast until now was really cool idea! I'd rate it 3000 not ten.

As I was watching, I couldn't stop thinking about how massive the budget for this film must have been, and when I looked it up, I was both surprised and unsurprised simultaneously; the investment really shows. Let's hope they'll spend a good chunk of the revenue on raises for their employees now that the film is such a success, but we all know the real odds of that happening."
3386,A perfect film for all marvel fans.have been expecting it for more than 6 years ...
3387,"Avengers: Endgame is possibly the best example of how to give fans the best possible payoff for staying with the series. While it does drag towards the beginning, it does so to develop our characters and make the later scenes more emotional and tense. Overall, while I may enjoy Infinity War a bit better, this was still an outstanding film that serves as one of the best out of all superhero movies."
3388,"I signed up to IMDB today just to write this. No spoilers here as I am myself a big big fan of Marvel movies. Was so looking forward to this movie but I have been dissapointed completely and feel it left me broken. I am a movie buff though dont really go to theatres to watch movies, the last one I saw in theatre was BAHUBALI 2 (Indian movie - sequel to Bahubali) and before that was 3 IDIOTS (Indian movie starring Aamir Khan). So I am very selective as which film deserve to be watched on the big screen, otherwise I just wait for the DVDs to come out. If people reading this know the 2 Indian movies I wrote about, Endgame was expected to be that level and its predecessor, Infinity War or may be even better. I dont feel the contentment I was hoping for, infact I feel like I will probably not go to theatres anymore after this has let me down. I dont want to hurt anyone's sentiments but this is my opinion (and I have the right to express my feelings so dont take it personally and me myself as a fan I feel I have been cheated). Thats all from me for MARVEL universe and the duo directors Joe Russo and Anthony Russo. GOODBYE."
3389,I can't for the world of me understand why someone who rated IW as a 7 or above can rate this finale on the lower half of the IMDb ratings scale. Both compliment each other brilliantly and beautifully with the former imbuing the latter with an epic power never before felt in a comic book movie. What has been achieved here and with the films in the run up to this film can't be underestimated. The comic book format springs to life on the screen in every aspect like never before. DC got there first with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight but that in no way detracts from this movie. The way I approached this film was to avoid all the reviews and hype that was swirling around it leading up to it release and beyond. I believe it did my viewing experience the world of good as my judgement wasn't coloured as a result. The action is balanced neatly with the character interaction. There isn't much character development required on account of the amount of films that have already done this in preparation for this particular movie. However what there is of it is slotted seamlessly into the storyline. The plot holes are there which prevents me from awarding it a 10. My advice would be to see it for yourself and if you can explain away some of the discrepancies as outlined in the more negative reviews then all the better. I did with a few of them but not all.
3390,"I have to Admit that "" its my first review ever on IMDb and Really excited to share my opinion on this amazing master piece of a movie. they came with an idea that would make your watching experience very distinct & Unique. you will laugh, cry, cheer, clap, and get goosebumps all at once, you will get this mixed feelings of sadness and emptiness. hoping this isn't the end of the MCU but you will need more because you will feel like if you are a member of the avengers all those past years of MCU movies.[換行字元][換行字元]Great Cast, Amazing acting, wonderful VFX. I love you marvel."
3391,"Month before the release, promotion of the highly anticipated ending of the MCU Phase 1 was everywhere in every form of media promotion. People queued in the nearby theatres as herd of sheep which were following the instructions of Disney that ""You need to watch this. If you don't, you made a sin"". I saw many sheep buying the tickets of the movie even though they didn't watch previous installments of the MCU and weren't aware of what they were going to watch.[換行字元][換行字元]Since the epic snap of Thanos in Infinity wars, everyone was waiting for the avengers to revert that and as expected Russo brothers came up with the idea of time travel to rescue the situation. But, handling Time travel is not cup of tea of every mediocre director. They should learn from Back to the Future (Robert Zemeckis), Terminator: Judgement Day (James Cameron). Russo brothers simply ruined a lot of things like Time Travel, Thor etc. The so called epic ending was boring, over stretched.[換行字元][換行字元]Avatar was way better than this crap. This doesn't belong to the top of highest grossing movies ever. It is outcome of just a great publicity festival ever done by Disney/marvel."
3392,"It was ok, not great just ok. I like infinity war more."
3393,"My First movie review ever and thats because I love Marvel absolutely love it to core and the expectations I had from this movie were just way too much, and after watching I am so disappointed. Infinity wars was just so much better, End Game has way too many plot holes and some very lazy writing. I wish I liked it after such a long wait but unfortunately I just couldnt"
3394,"After the absolutely amazing Infinity War it felt like an impossible task to top that movie and it was. Endgame is a fun film and does a lot of things right but it is much less impactful than Infinity War. There is a lot of (good) fanservice and excellent cinematography but the plot is lacking in some areas. It certainly has its problems but the film is incredibly fun and a real achievement to crown a decade of buildup in the MCU. Plenty of twists and genuinely heartfelt / emotional moments, amazing performances and the CGI is some of the best ever put to screen. Looking forward to the next decade of Marvel to see just how far they can take the cinematic universe model!"
3395,What a movie !!! With respect this is the best movie of super heroes ..that's my opinion
3396,The best movie ever it's good to finaly make a movie that beat avatar
3397,Infinity War was way better. Endgame is super slow and even at times pretty boring. The third act somehow misses the mark and falls short of being the epic finale we've all been waiting for. Overall it was okay. It wasn't horrible. Definitely not the best either.
3398,I was not expecting the movie would be great and it turns out it's great!
3399,Something like this movie never happen again Thank u MCU😀😀
3400,"There have been few movie events as big as the 22nd instalment into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As the title suggests, this three-hour epic is the culmination of a 12-year series that has become the benchmark for blockbuster movie-making. Since Iron Man screened in 2008 I've been there every step of the way, which makes it virtually impossible to view, or review, Endgame with any sort of objectivity. Staying spoiler-free means there's little I can talk about in the way of plot specifics, although suffice to say there are twists and turns all the way throughout this sweeping finale as it strives to deliver satisfying conclusions and/or defining moments for the vast array of beloved characters. Justifiably, there's no attempt here to bring in new fans or to create a film that can stand on its own; it's a cathartic, somewhat nostalgic experience that relies on the emotional investment built up over 21 movies. This franchise has arguably become a tad unwieldly, with the team-up adventures in particular having to squeeze in an increasing amount of heroes; however, Endgame whittles it mostly back to the original Avenger crew, which is both wise and fitting. It's glorious to watch Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Hulk and Hawkeye teaming up for their biggest battle yet, with the MCU's big bad Thanos just a click away from causing Earth even more grief than before. Despite the end-of-world stakes the humour is amped up to surprisingly high levels, the quips and one-avengers endliners coming thick and fast in amongst ambitious long-form gags that reference previous entries whilst also subverting convention and audience expectation. The quantity of action sequences is relatively low with a distinct lack of memorable set pieces to inspire awe, but the climactic showdown is a fist-pumping crowd pleaser that throws everything except the kitchen sink at the screen. The finale also boasts one of the MCU's greatest moments, a simple but hugely effective surprise that sends shivers down the spine. It's by no means a perfect film - even the lightest of retrospective discussion unearths the abundance of plot holes - and it'll likely diminish in favour once far enough removed from the current zeitgeist surrounding it. But it doesn't matter. This is a cinematic experience for the now. It's meant to be consumed with the hype still swirling around it. The numerous flaws may be ripe for criticising down the track, at present they're merely blips in a gratifying conclusion of the 22-film 'Infinity Saga'. The MCU isn't finished, not by a long shot, and I can't wait to see where the next 22 MCU outings take us, but Avengers: Endgame is the end of an era, and boy has it been one hell of a fun ride!"
3401,"So I just got back from the midnight premiere of ""Avengers: Endgame"" and boy, I can not tell anyone enough just how epic and grand this movie was. It makes all the other Marvel movies over the last decade incredibly worth it, and brings the story that began all the way back in 2008 with ""Iron Man"" full circle. I can confidently say that this movie is even better than ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"". And this is coming from a guy who attended the midnight double feature premiere of ""Deathly Hallows"" on July 15, 2011.[換行字元][換行字元]""Endgame"" is just an epic, fun, and exciting film filled with fantastic action sequences, funny humor to lighten the mood, and excellent drama between the Avengers characters that audiences have come to know and love over the last decade. The acting is just phenomenal with everyone getting their chances to shine and my hat goes to Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark who arguably gives the best performance of the film and possibly the best out of the entire franchise. He just embodied the character of Iron Man with his quirky mannerisms and traits. He puts his heart and soul into the character that he is the character. The film is probably the most emotionally gripping out of all the Marvel movies and bonus points for extra emotion go to audiences like myself who have been watching these movies since the first ""Iron Man"". I can not explain enough just how amazing this film is and it serves as the perfect conclusion to the Avengers series. At the same time, I am kind of sad to see what I've come to know and love come to an end. But good things eventually do have to come to an end at some point."

However, it becomes apparent that by travelling through time and collecting all the 'Infinity Stones', they might be able to create a space in time where they will be able to step in from the past and reverse the present. With all the gang lost in limbo after their defeat, they must muster all their strength together once again to save the planet.[換行字元][換行字元]Despite rave reviews that made the previous Infinity War appear average, I took the sweetest of time getting round to see the even latest addition in the Marvel universe films.

The suffix here is Endgame, which is surely what IW was meant to be, especially given the rug pulling, unexpected ending.

It's a detrimentally overlong and drawn out affair, that builds up to a big crowd pleasing finale at the end which is worth sticking around for, but has nearly worn you out completely by the time its got there.[換行字元][換行字元]For these legions of comic book fans that seem to have emerged over the last few years, it's a dream come true.

3404,"A great movie, had me laughing throughout and special effects were top draw. Loads of twists and turns and really worth a trip to the cinema to see."
3405,Must watch movie.... whatever it takes you'll be on the edge of your seats itsi too surprising too amazing too epic.
3406,"This film has it all, action, laughs and the occasional tear. There is very little to complain about this very well though out end to the Avengers series."
3407,I wasnt quite sure about this movie due to what could honestly top infinity war well all i can say is this did it and did it extremely well its fantastic its action packed hilarious and very fast moving i can honestly say this is the hit of april so much fun
3408,Greatest superhero movie ever and a emotional dose first time in superhero movie amazing adventures and love u 3000
3409,I'm just gonna say I don't think they could of made a better finale. Honestly every time I watch this movie I cry all the way through not even just at the emotional parts just because the story telling and build is so powerful. Will go down as one of my Favorited movies of all time. This is true film making.
3410,It's just one big mess and I fell asleep. I kept wondering what was even happening??
3411,No superhero fan will be disappointed with this movie!
3412,Sorry but this film was to long and boring for well over half of the film
3413,"Just brilliant, the cinematography, the sound, the costumes, a true marvel film at its best"
3414,Too much hype Toooooo many loopholes The story is so impossible that it makes fiction look like fiction .. I mean it always was but this gives me physical indigestion People are crazy dumb to say it is awesome because nothing makes any sense What with nebula from the future killing nebula from the past !!! What with captain America returning on a bench and not in the time machine !!! Just any damn thing .. senseless .. in coherent .. logically defunct
3415,There are a handfull of lose ends that people may choose to focus on and a few characters dont quiet get their moment to shine but this was an amazing film. It doesnt feel like 3 hours (like I care I'm looking forward to a back to back viewing with Inifinity War) the last act alone is worth the price of admission
3416,"I didn't brought any tissues with me, stupid me, is this real, I'm pinching myself, yes it's real. I love how everything connects and falls in place, the hello's the goodbye's. What a spectacular ending, never thought my heart would ache from a movie but it does now."
3417,"As a long waited end to a franchise, this movie is probably one of the best in the MCU: great conclusion to a great legacy, end of an era.[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]But as a stand alone movie, it falls short of expectations: plot is simply predictable, they turned Thor, a character that lost arguably the most in the last film, into a joke not exploring the idea of more complex character development, emotions are forced upon the audience based purely on nostalgia, Hawkeye is forced into the plot, making him as linear as possible (he killed hundreds of people and then returned to his normal life without any real problems). That would all make a 7/10 movie, visual effects felt off from time to time, most noticable on Hulk and Spiderman. Music is sometimes a bit cheesy, but all in all good. Then the plotholes kicked in: the time travel is one of the worst tome travels in modern movie history, resulting in a contradiction that negates the effectiveness of the end. Second plot hole is definitely Tony Stark being able to use all of the five gems not suffering any pain (Hulk had to concentrate and fight the pain for at least a minute, and he is the strongest Avenger, Tony being merely a human). A lot of things happened just for the plots sake, turning the second act into a sequence of extremely unbelievable moments. This is usually not a problem, since unbelievable things happen in real life, but it was a bit too much when they visited the past. They developed the time travel way too fast, they could have wasted at least two or three months on developing their plans, it happened way too fast.[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]To sum up, 8/10 movie as a part of the MCU, 5/10 movie as a standalone title.

3418,"This movie was just beautiful, ten years of movies and this one is the best, not a very emotional person when it comes to movies, I rarely cry, and I did, more than once actually. It was just amazing, everything, vfx, soundtrack, marvel, what a ride, everything I espected and more, it deserves everything it has everything. It deserves to be between the best, because it is one of the best. Just marvelous. It's perfect, just love it! Thank you Marvel, thank you to everyone who made this movie, cast, director´s, producer, just every single one of then. What a ride!!! Love it 3000"

3420,"Avengers: Endgame is the most emotional, exciting and satisfying movie not only in the MCU but of any movie I've ever seen. Almost everything in this movie is perfect and is incredibly satisfying to:those that have seen all of the MCU from start to finish. I cannot urge you enough to watch all of the MCU and the pun treat yourself to this masterpiece of a movie."
3421,"2 for 3 hours of the movie is basic action, does't mean that is bad, but mean that does not have a relief in the action, and sometimes just feels like some characters are lost with there personalities only to make a comic relief. Despite of the useless comedy, is a fun movie with a touching and to the Avengers. But im secretly happy that is over."
3422,That's the word. The movie takes you to a roller coaster ride of emotions from beginning to the end. No spoiler can keep you away from liking the movie because the plot is made by some genius efforts. Love A marvel fan #WhateverItTakes

It was still better than I thought it would be. It was easily better than last year's ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (although I think of them as two halves of the same epic movie). I don't pretend to be a film expert, so take this as speculation - I personally think the pair of ""Infinity"" films have made comic-book movie history in the same manner as the original ""Superman"" (1978), Tim Burton's ""Batman"" (1989) and Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" trilogy (2005-2012).[換行字元][換行字元]I don't really want to make any more observations, because I'm too afraid of inadvertently posting spoilers.

It feels strange to write here, but I kept thinking during the movie that this was a more ""grown up"" Marvel film.[換行字元][換行字元]And it is EPIC. I honestly can't imagine how Marvel can top it with future films. There is an action set piece that made my jaw drop. I can't say more.[換行字元][換行字元]This is an obvious 10 out of 10 from me."

It's everything you hope for and more. I have been invested in the MCU ever since, ""I am Iron-Man"" and I have to say this was the perfect way to cap of this story arc. Even though it's 3 hours long, it feels like 30 minutes, I was actually sad when I realized their was only thirty minutes left."

There was no cohesion, the characters were not given that balanced screen time, the cleverness and timely humor wasn't there.

There are some plot holes here and there, but they can be looked past.

It is 1 hour too long, Ironman is just as annoying as always, they destroyed Thor's character and it was very boring in the first half. There is no comparison to Infinity war or the first captain America movie which had pace and great editing. Even die hard marvel fans have said end game is not what they wanted. I do appreciate this kind of movie brings customers out that don't normally venture to the cinema but this is pure marketing hype and people obviously do not watch a lot of movies to say it's amazing! Watch more decent movies folks!!"

In this movie we see the efforts of Iron man, Captain America and Thor equate to far less than the capabilities of Captain Marvel. Her character comes across as arrogant and she makes our favorite heros look puny. Thor is made into a joke(again). And there is a very unsubtle shoving of a feminist ideology in this movie. Marvel would be nothing without characters like Scarlett witch, black widow, the ladies of Wakanda, Nebula, Gamora and so much more however, Captain Marvel quite literally makes the efforts of our favorite heroes seem pointless. Nothing on infinity war. Disappointed but not entirely surprised as Disney also butchered Star Wars when they got their hands on it."

I had the highest hopes for the film and the hype train was eating me up like crazy, I never expected the film could live up to what I imagined I wanted in my head because what I wanted was crazy and I basically just didn't think the mcu was crazy enough to pull it off..... but how I was WRONG! This film, no this masterpiece is a game changer, it was incredible. I'm not the best with words but this film gave me so much happiness, excitement, emotion, thrill and all the other good feels!! I was literally blown away at how clever the story is, all the character arcs and generally just everything about the film. So yeah long story short this film is a easy 10/10 I'm a huge marvel fan and this film is deffo at Number 1 in the list now and that says a lot from me cause I think all the other films are insanely good and yeah, if your reading this please go watch and experience and enjoy this masterpiece!"

This is in my opinion the pinnacle of cinema and I don't think I'm ever going to see a movie in the theaters ever again (except this movie again 2-3 more times). Just. Go. See. It."

3454,"This movie is truly fantastic and a brilliant way to end this chapter of the MCU. Even though the spoiler ban has been lifted, I still feel guilty about spoiling any of it. It's THAT good. While it may not have a heavy emphasis on action until the last hour, during that time without it we get some of the most emotionally resonant and entertaining scenes in the entire MCU. The actors for these characters are clearly at their best in this film, with Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner giving some of their best performances yet as the original six Avengers, especially Downey and Johansson who give some of their best performances in their careers. They deliver comedy excellently and emotions just as well. The movie continuously goes against everything you expect and unlike The Last Jedi, it all works out. And while the final hour of the film is the very definition of fanservice, it was GOOD fanservice. It felt like every MCU film, no matter how insignificant, built up to this moment and it was glorious. This film had my heart pounding at several moments and had me laughing hysterically at others, but I guess you could say that it doesn't balance it's tone as well as Infinity War did. However, when this movie is dramatic it does it expertly well, the last time I saw a superhero movie do something that well was with Logan (2017), and that was already a once in a blue moon kind of superhero movie. All in all, Endgame is fantastic, emotionally powerful and a fitting end to the Infinity Saga, and I wouldn't have it any other way."
3455,Look it is the best movie I've ever saw in my life. Plz watch only in theatres.
3456,This film was too long. The dialogues were boring and formalistic Overall it represents the maximum of mediocrity. It felt pretty much like when you eat too much candy.
3457,"Avengers Endgame is an amazing film just like Infinity War but for different reasons. Keep in mind, infinity war and endgame aren't just two separate films, it's one long film split into two parts. In IW we got comedy, lots of action and some good one liners. Endgame gives us drama and redemption. With some comedy and science fiction mixed in. The final battle was stunning and the events that I will not spoil make for an epic and emotional ending to an 11 year old saga."
3458,"Well. Went to see it opening night and came out so disappointed. Was reading reviews when going in (without the spoilers) that were so great only to be hugely disappointed!!! No spoilers in this review as none are really necessary. To much time on empty characters (Hawkeye), way to long to bring back the half that are gone so most of the movie was wasted with slow plots that will be destroyed in the end. The captain ending is stupid. How many holes are there now!!! And boring hulk!!!! Why???? Infinity war was on a different level and this just fell off from the beginning. I felt like when I watched the NEW Star Wars movies. Total waste and let down. I think they forgot what got them this far and just caved to making the almighty dollar in the end."
3459,"Avengers Endgame is a great movie with amazing actors and visual. This movie has action but at the same time comedic and sad parts. The only negative i could give is that for most of the big plot twists l, they all appeared predictable and obvious to happen about 10 minutes before they did or were announced."
3460,"Fanboys are ruining the movie industry. 9,1? Really? This movie is far from the best movie of all times. It's insane and sad. Disney is cancer."
3461,"At first, it was very making the world feel the hype. And then when this is released, BOOM! Everybody's very happy to watch this movie."
3462,Superhero stuff happens and there is about as much depth as the first edition of pong.
3463,Emotional finale and a Spectacular conclusion to a decades worth of memories!
3464,"This film is RI-DI-CULOUS! It's 99% self oriented on men great old hero's Iron Man (poor martyr), captain America, the Archer and Banner. So many drama scenes boring. No place with such testosterone for Captain Marvel, 5min on 2H. People don't waist your money!"
3465,I loved this movie even though I decided to give only 8/10. The ending was very sad and perfect for the Avenger series.
3466,"An amazing end. I cant write. I am watching mcu for ,10 years and i love too much this series. When i see the end i just go away and cry myself."
3467,"I am one that hates to see sequels because they all seem to let you down, however, Avengers: Endgame delivered on the spot. It's thrilling, adventuresome, full of nail-biting excitement, happy one moment and then... sad and tearful as well. This movie is worth the time and money you spend to see it. After Endgame, I do wonder how the Avenger's sequels/new story lines will be like... even still, I am a fan! (its a much better movie than a lot of mess coming out of Hollywood these days)."
3468,"The Endgame is not like the previous instalments, first, it is too long, also it is boring in some parts... Too slow like drama movies,[換行字元][換行字元]The theme of the movies is dark(like DC movies) which doesn't appealing in 3D.[換行字元][換行字元]Some action is good, worth to watch.[換行字元][換行字元]If you are a die-hard fan of Marvel movies then go for it."
3469,Weak writing.[換行字元][換行字元]Bad guys are bad for the sake of being bad.[換行字元][換行字元]Too much reliance upon CGI and cute punchlines.
3470,It's everything marvel made well in one movie Characters driven stories Beautiful action Emotional moments Development Scenes that give chills Good cgi Beatiful soundtrack Good jokes Good serious moments Sciente Fantasy
3471,Well nothing much to say here but We Love you Ironman...
3472,"MCU delivers more than we all expected. Laughter, sadness, and something that can't be explained in words. Will watch it again and again even after 10-15 years just to relive those excitements."
3473,The movie was awesome!! just what we the fans deserve after all these years of being loyal to the MCU universe
3474,"No matter what you think you can expect about Marvel Studios' Avengers: Endgame movie, the movie will be far from your expectations![換行字元][換行字元]Just try to remember the main characters in the last 20 movies before watching it."
3475,Amazing and awesome movie. Best ending after 22 movies
3476,"I think my problem with this movie is there was SO MUCH STORY to cover that much of the screen time is devoted to exposition and tying up loose ends- too much of the movie feels more like an obligation than an adventure.[換行字元][換行字元]My other complaint is that there were some fantastic ideas presented in the film that don't quite play out to their potential. It still get points for introducing the ideas at all, but ultimately they left me a touch disappointed.[換行字元][換行字元]But honestly, I can't imagine how they could've done things any differently (just like Dr. Strange said! There was only one way for this to end!).[換行字元][換行字元]I won't ruin the ending, but I'll just say it's clear that ACT 3 is where the filmmakers put all of their attention, and it pays off VERY well.[換行字元][換行字元]I think Infinity War is a far superior movie in terms of writing, editing, and overall fun, but this movie will still satisfy fans.[換行字元][換行字元]Bitter sweet see the end of a 10 year era of movie-making, but it was great to be along for the ride."
3477,"The Russo duo are officially 4 for 4 in the MCU with the release of Avengers: Endgame. Full of heart, nostalgia, and masterfully crafted character development, the latest installment of the MCU will bring you to tears and make you laugh hard enough to the point of tears. Although it is not as well-paced as Infinity War, most criticisms of the movie are nitpicking this fantastic movie. The only word that can truly describe this movie is ""WOW."""
3478,"In 2008 the MCU gave us, Iron Man and throughout the years more of our marvel heroes were brought to life. Then they united together and became, the Avengers. In 2018 they fought against their main villain, Thanos and then something tragic happened to them. Now it's 2019 and the final battle is about to commence! Who will win? You'll find out. Let me tell you that you'll be on an emotional roller coaster throughout this film, but you'll also get plenty of humor that we all enjoy when it comes to these movies. The storyline is strong and the actors were perfect. As for the action, talk about intense fight scenes that make you root for your favorite hero to win! Did I cry? Yeah, of course! A tear here and there, because you just can't help it when you watch all the endearing moments, especially when it comes down to the climatic battle. You have to see it, especially if you watched all the 21 marvel films before this one and if you haven't, I'm sure you'll get a brief recap on what has happened and who is who from the person you're seeing it with. At the end, If I was able to stand up from my wheelchair, I'd have given a hero salute. Thank you MCU for making these movies and making it come to this.[換行字元][換行字元]lol, I do wonder if people will be this critical again against spoilers when the final chapter of Star Wars comes out this year. Oh well, this is my roller review, just roll with it."
3479,"This is going to be unpopular opinion but after reading many of these reviews, it may not become unpopular. I will do the best I can to keep this spoiler free. There are obvious plot holes that will drive many MCU & non MCU fans nuts. Also, the movie starts off very slow and never really takes off for 2 hours. While there were emotional scenes & good actions scenes near & in the end of the film, it doesn't fully deliver its full potential throughout. Some of the superheroes barely get any screen time as well & you'll see why many people complain about Thor's obnoxious behavior. While it may to tempting to bash this movie to bits and give it a 5, I respect the ideas, acting, music, CGI, & work that was put into this. It definitely wasn't half a**ed but also wasn't completely solid either. Overall, you will most definitely be entertained and leave the theater with a smile on your face most likely but soon realize Infinity War is sooooo much better & more memorable due to its comedy, action, CGI, equal use of superheroes, plot, & the memorable Thanos. However, this movie didn't irritate me enough for me to hate on it. If you have kids tho, this movie will be a blast for them as my theater had kids hollering & emotional. 7/10 for my rating."
3480,"This movie wrapped years of marvel movies I have seen and it was epic, people are saying it was slow it was boring, I don't think they understand how the movie was the story had emotion with that emotion you lived the last ever marvel avengers movie.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie is just amazing it has thrown everything in the mix and I would say if you have not seen this movie your are missing out."
3481,"I'm not a hardcore ""Avengers"" fan. But being a movie fan means I am of course caught up in the buzz around this. Unfortunately I feel this is purely aimed at the mega fans, and I can imagine even some of them being disappointed.[換行字元][換行字元]It all starts out promising. Setting things up and being as good humoured as usual. But then the time travelling stuff sets in. At first it sounded like this was going to be fun. But as it marched on it felt like way to much was being thrown in there, and the entire story (and a few of the previous movies) seem to get trashed in the chaos. I love time travel movie's if they setup some rules and stick to them. But do alot of contradicting stuff and you lose me.[換行字元][換行字元]Still. There are a few surprises, and the big finale is still amazing to look at. The Ending does seem fitting, but the stink from the middle part of the movie stays throughout, and i was left scrathcing my head at least a couple of times more with revelations at the end.[換行字元][換行字元]Oh, and I'm not sure what I think about the hulk in this. He seemed like he was just there for laughs. Unintentional or otherwise."
3482,"This entire movie had me so close to tears due to the well choreographed and paced scenes throughout the middle and end of the film. The music, setting, and story behind each and every one of these heroes add to the emotional storytelling present."
3483,I have watched this movie last week in theater with my friends. Awesome movie rather then another movies.
3484,"Avengers: Endgame defies 11 years of mounting hype and expectations to deliver a rousing, crowd-pleasing, and appropriately emotional endcap to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's ""Infinity Saga"". From its now-humble beginnings in 2008, the MCU has evolved from mainly character-driven origin stories, to world-decimating adventures that span multiple universes. At times, this evolution has correlated to a loss in grounded emotion, but Avengers: Endgame wisely returns to the MCU's earlier method of storytelling by shifting its focus back to its core heroes and their story arcs. Avengers: Endgame fittingly ties together ALL 21 previous MCU films in a way that not only honors but elevates those previous movies - it truly feels as if every journey, grand (The Avengers) or small (Ant-Man & The Wasp), has been equally instrumental in building to this climax. The fact that Avengers: Endgame pulls off this tremendous feat, while also managing a few surprises along the way, is nothing short of a remarkable cinematic achievement. Now can critics argue that the film has its fair share of plot holes and relies too heavily on fan service at times - sure. Are the MCU's notorious tonal shifts still present and still jarring - of course. But is it likely we'll ever experience a superhero film saga this epic in scope with a pay-off this exceptional and well-earned again - no. 'Nuff said."
3485,One of the dullest films I've seen in a long time. The initial three quarters of the film is taken up with sentimental and tedious character development twaddle including flashbacks. It ends with 30mins of seen it all before low rent CGI action. That this can have a rating of over 8 is a testament to the serious dumbing down of our popular culture.
3486,I.ll be brief and say some spots were amazing wont spoil but there were times that just totally ruined it ... Captain Marvel and her im the best dead pan delivery was horrendous...and THOR lol wtf happened to that very very poor showing of a bad ass charater who deserved way more then this ..same goes with HULK... was a delight to watch but no way does it capture the pacing and character development of infinity war .. and that battle scene will go down in marvel movie history as one the best epic finales to a movie EVER.... SNAPPP...
3487,Great movie and great entertainment beside Disney politics that ruin several movies.
3488,I wonder where such great heroes live who rescue humanity? In real world I couldn't find help to rescue myself from torture for last 15 years.
3489,"Endgame is a fun movie to go see, it has its problems but is a fun movie. These reviews on here giving it 10 out of 10 and saying that is the first perfect movie are 100% wrong. Dont go in expecting this movie to be better than godfather or citizen kane as these reviews describe. It's a fun movie with fun action, no it's not an oscar contender, no it's not a ground breaking never before been done movie, and no it is not a 10 out of 10 perfect movie. Go in expecting a fun watch with some cringy comedy and you will enjoy the experience. But dont listen to the people saying that this is a perfect movie, or the best ever made."
3490,Nothing wrong to say about this movie. Really really good.
3491,"And they made the one that really, really worked. There were old people, 70+ years old, and young,6, 7, or 8 years old. Total fans and people who had only seen a few of the preceding 22 movies They all applauded. There were times the theatre was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. There were times when everyone held their breath. There were times you could not be so stone coldhearted that you would not tear up. There were times when you could not help but smile. There were times when you had to laugh. There were times when you recalled a special moment from an earlier movie in a brand new way. There were things that are brand-new By the end of the movie you saw the whole series in a different light. I wish I could see it again without ever having seen it beforehand. There were so many small touches that made the movie special and capped the series perfectly. And yet, the movie worked for people who had never read the comics or seen most of the movies. Like I said, they made the one that really, really worked. Thank you, Avengers! #Cap #Tony #Thor #Nat #Clint #Hulk"
3492,"How come so many people love this movie ? It was extremely boring, it was difficult to stay awake for three hours"
3493,"Great, the start a bit to slow but the rest perfect."
3494,"Loved infinity war and hoped end game would be close but ended up very disappointed. The movie started off strong then felt slow for the next 2 hours. While the movie did end on a good note, the plot overall felt very lazy and was filled with plot holes. The few great moments make the movie worth it but definitely not in the elite superhero movies for me"
3495,"MOST EPIC AND PERFECT MOVIE SERIES CONCLUSION EVER !!!!!!!!! The perfect culmination to all the movies. It will take you on a roller coaster ride of emotions and leave you laughing, clapping, crying and gasping all at the same time. The character handling of each character will satisfy you, as all the characters get their fair share of moments of glory. Enjoy this epicness at the widest screen available as no words can do justice to it's greatness. You will love it 3000!!!!!"
3496,"Endgame is mind blowing it exceeded my wildest expectations. Yesterday I watched it in Centaurus on smaller screen with low sound quality still enjoyed a lot. It is impossible to digest this movie first time there is so much going on, Trust me no one is prepared for this 3 hours thrill ride. Anyways today i watched it again in Arena bigger screen better quality and sound and I enjoyed every second of it. Could've been 20 minutes shorter though but still no complaints[換行字元][換行字元]Sigh... this is indeed end of an era."
3497,"Marvel have done such a great job at creating a broad storyline, that pieces together like a puzzle. This truly is a Marvel fans fandream movie. It does sag a bit in the middle. Some characters are a little underwhelming, Thors storyline was dull. I did feel like there was more invested interest in Captain America, because the Russo brothers have already built that character up so much.[換行字元][換行字元]But that last battle was amazing. It reminded me of the feeling I got when I first saw the final act of the Attack of the Clones, truly awesome!"
3498,"I know that the MCU will continue just not with the same actors/heroes we have got to know and love. End of an era. Though i will say that this universe has filled my life for the last 10 years with adventure, loss, and so much more, and not to forget, community.[換行字元][換行字元]I have gotten many friends in real life and over the internet through Marvel. Infinity War was the beginning of the ending and the reviews talk for itself. It was a great story, great acting, great friendship and a great adventure. Endgame is probably the most anticipated film for the last 10 years. Even though we didnt know anything about it 10 years ago and i gotta say it didnt dissapoint.[換行字元][換行字元]Usually when a movie is so anticipated and hyped as Endgame it is easier to be dissapointed, but not in this case. Endgame delivers an incredible satisfying ending to an era of Marvel and my life. This has been an increcible journey for me and it has been an escape for me through rough times. I sat and enjoyed the 3 hours 2 times, will go see it the 3rd time. For me it could have been 6 hours?! With every friend or family member i have talked to that just know a little about MCU, says the same thing. Once in a generation.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you Marvel, Thank you Stan Lee for this great universe. Go see the movie, you will not regret it."
3499,"#New York city.. This movie is very good, there is no mistake in it. but some moment is missing in this movie I wanted to see a single fight between iron Man and thanos. Also with the main character of MCU. but overall it's a good movie and I love 3000 and special thanks for Russo brother and Stan Lee.."
3500,"It was a great movei , and i'm still surbrised how the game is ended"
3501,"To incredible fanfare and hype, ""Avengers: Endgame"" has arrived. I am happy to say that the film most definitely lives up to expectations, and offers audiences a thrilling, emotionally stirring, and incredibly satisfying finale to the Avengers saga. While it's not completely perfect, it's undoubtedly a great film and far superior to last year's ""Avengers: Infinity War."" While I know that many people loved ""Infinity War,"" I dissented from them due to the excess of ""filler"" in the narrative that made the film seem simultaneously overstuffed and not completely satisfying--with the exception of the film's ending, which was one of the biggest cliffhangers in modern film history.[換行字元][換行字元]The film picks up as the stakes from the shocking ending of ""Infinity War"" are a clear reality. and the Avengers must figure out how to defeat Thanos. I'm not going to say much else regarding the plot, but what I will say is that the film's emotional core relative to other comic book films is what truly elevates it. The action scenes are no longer just entertaining action scenes, but battles with real characters that audiences truly care about and have gone on a journey with for many films and many years now. This emotional core is enhanced by the film's score and cinematography, which are both generally understated yet also beautifully impactful at the same time. The film is consistently entertaining and paced incredibly well, and never drags despite its 181-minute runtime. There are plenty of twists and turns that even many serious fans probably won't be expecting, as the Russos do a great job with trying to subvert audience expectations. The performances are all great, and much of the cast has grown and changed quite a bit from their earlier days in MCU movies. This film is less action-focused than ""Infinity War,"" and that works to its benefit since so many important plot points are generally emphasized over action. Make no mistake, the action (and especially the climax) is excellent in this film when it happens. But ""Avengers: Endgame"" shows us that there is even more to Marvel films than those moments, no matter how thrilling and entertaining they may be. Despite its relatively minor flaws (some inconsistencies and fallacies in its narrative structure,) it's a truly fascinating exercise in watching all of the puzzle pieces of the MCU be put together, and it will be interesting to see where Marvel movies go from this point. 8.5/10[換行字元][換行字元]Note: I saw this film in Dolby Cinema. The picture and sound quality were generally strong, but this was not one of the best Dolby presentations I have come across."
3502,"I really don't know how I could express my feelings after watching this movie. One of the best movie in world cinema. It will connect with your emotions if you are really an MCU fan. Stunt in climax is fabulous, the complete theaters were totally silent and most of them are cried out loudly. I'm really speechless for some time, director did very well job, no compromise, no unwanted scenes; the movie is more then 3 hours but I feel just 30 min because of the intensive screenplay. I can hear continuous claps throughout the movie; this movie will fulfill all the lead characters fans expectations.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is combination of Humor, emotions sacrifice, friendship, family etc. Go and watch it with your friends and family."
3503,Was not expecting anything like that from marvel so weak
3504,"Unconscious people try to distract their emptiness (depression, anxiety, loneliness) with pointless Marvel/DC films that don't contribute to happiness. Real growth is not what you WANT externally, but releasing your need for it internally! What happens after watching a pointless film? You go back home looking for more ways to distract yourself. 😔 (sex, drugs, tevelvison, YouTube, Facebook, parties, travel, food, gossip, debating, shopping, approval seeking ect) You're disconnected from being (life)... because you're caught up in FANTASY.[換行字元][換行字元]Hollywood is desperate because all they care about is MONEY! This is what happens when you take modern capitalism to its extreme. You think directors, producers care about your health? Noooo! We need to get in the habit of exploring deeper topics. Not these pointless films that don't connect with your higher self."
3505,"Avengers: Endgame causes quite mixed feelings, but it will not leave anyone indifferent for sure. On the one hand ""Endgame"" is filmed in the best tradition of ""Marvel"", it makes you feel all these crazy emotions, and just simply fascinates you with its enchanting atmosphere! On the other hand, after watching the movie I just had this strange feeling of incompleteness, some kind of dissatisfaction I would say...[換行字元][換行字元]""Endgame"" turned out so exciting that three hours flew in one breath. So much going on in there, in the end I just felt like three hours were clearly not enough! There is no time to react to jokes or heartbreaking moments because they were going one after another way too fast. Time was so brief that some of the characters just said couple of sentences for entire movie, and the final fight seemed to end just after it started...[換行字元][換行字元]However, the final fight, which is no doubt the most epic moment of ""Endgame"" (because it was so long awaited!), clearly deserves more screen time. Although scene was amazing, but seemed hastily done, because of too many characters first of all. Therefore, despite the interesting opening, some of not very important for the movie scenes in my opinion might be cut so final fight's screen time could be increased instead.[換行字元][換行字元]It should be noted that in general movie turned out quite unpredictable, although from the very beginning it was quite clear what will be end of ""Endgame"". There were also few unexpected plot twists, some of which by the way I just can't accept! The dramatics certainly makes any ""superhero"" movie more realistic, but the thing is ""Endgame"" turned way too dramatic in the end.[換行字元][換行字元]After quite sad ""Infinity War"", I just wanted to see happy ""Endgame""! What we got is the impression that the movie turned out even more gloomy than the previous one. And if after ""Infinity War"" there was at least hope for a bright future, after ""Endgame"" everything seems even more hopeless. What especially sad is to realize that most likely it will not be continued. Probably therefore the movie makes you to feel not satisfied, and some of fans may even feel a bit disappointed..."
3506,"I very much loved this movie, though the beginning act was very slow and drawn out making the film almost boring. The second and third act saved the movie as those were the best parts."
3507,"Too drawn out, for a film series that has been synonymous with action, this was a bit of a letdown."
3508,"No faults found, outstanding film, completely delivered"
3509,They way this movie makes the theatre silent. Wow Absolute 10/10!
3510,"Before walking into the theater I thought of a dozen different ways this movie could possibly play out, but it was none of those. It progresses in a make-sense but surprising fashion that I've never seen in any other movies. Not to say it doesn't have plot holes, but I happily embrace it because I honest believe no one could've done a better job in writing the story. Great job Marvel and thank you for pulling this off!"
3511,So bad they shoukd of thought about this for lonher
3512,"They say everything that has a beginning has an end. But for the last decade, every marvel movie has struck a chord with our lives. Every new release has been intricately entwined with our lives. Back then little did we know that the series would someday come to an end. That we would miss some of our favourite heroes. And then all of sudden for a brief moment, life does seem meaningless. Some may find all the emotions of marvel fans simply hyperbolic. But believe it or not even for a second, you will find euphoria in life without any drugs if you watch Endgame. When you like a dish, you just like it. Your tongue feels it. The aroma you inhale from it plays with your neurons. You never like a dish by digging deep into all the ingredients, the spices or for that matter into the carefully structured recipe. Avengers Endgame is one such dish you relish with all your senses. But when you realise this is the last course of a delectable dish, you tend to suck into every bit of it. Endgame truly is the best culmination of a series.Period."
3513,This movie made all marvel fans what they want! It's an emotional movie for all. I saw that all had tears in their eyes at climax. Best movie ever! Guys don't miss it!
3514,Everyone did great in this movies...love you all..specially you captain...whatever it takes..💪🏻
3515,The marvel universe creators managed to create an overwhelming ending with great plot and substitial history for the almost 3 hours endgame. Congratulations I'm very happy to have lived this universe. Gonna miss you all.
3516,AMAZING BEAUTIFUL WOW OMG GREAT THE BEST AWESOME PERFECT EPIC COSMIC POWERFUL BRILLIANT
3517,Best move in the world 10/10 go to number 1 in the world
3518,This movie is the best Marvel movie ever! Perfect ending for an amazing series.
3519,Best super heroes film evaa thank you marvel !! great moviee
3520,"Feels the same like with the ""Lost"" ending- they went too far and couldn't tie all loose ends eventually."
3521,Love most of the marvel movies so far (except captain marvel) but this was a total let down :(
3522,If you are even a remote fan of this universe you must watch this!
3523,"Definitly one of the best marvels movie,Definitly one of the best marvels movie,"
3524,"I had higher expectations for the Endgames action, if you compare it with Infinity War, but plot did focus more on the characters. Lots of funny scenes in the movie as always. Only concern i left the cinema with a few questions, sure they will be answered soon after most have watched it. It's a 3 hours movie that doesn't make you feel like watching 3 hours, even if it would go 3,5 hours or more you would still sitting and watch it and time would flow away. But the feeling you get in the end is that an Era came to it's end."
3525,This is a epic movie with full of emotion action and story you can't miss this movie it awesome even sec of the movie is epic
3526,"Avengers: Endgame is a well-made and well-deserved victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It ties in many different storylines from previous films and allows you reminisce while also saying goodbye to characters you've known and loved. This film has some flaws, of course, but it also made some bold choices and surprised me a number of times. I laughed. I cried. I loved this finale to the Infinity Saga."
3527,Certainly one of the most amazing scifi movies I have ever seen
3528,This is only one movie my favorite movie alltime-Forever.
3529,"What can I say, Epic, emotional, shocks and twists.... No one is prepared for this. The movie felt like 1.5 hours even though was 3 and could have gone for another hour and still flown by. You will need to watch multiple times as a lot happens that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and to process everything that goes on. The ending credits are different to pay homage to the cast and to signal end of an arc spanning 11 years. This movie deserves to knock avatar off the highest grossing movie of all time. From Aus to U.S you are in for a wild ride once opens.."
3530,"Endgame was brilliantly executed giving a perfect end to an already perfect Avengers series and a great conclusion to 22 Marvel movies.[換行字元][換行字元]It starts slowly, but that's because the story develops. Everything else the cast, characters, cinematography was impressive.[換行字元][換行字元]Highly recommended.[換行字元][換行字元]Will miss Marvel movies after the last movie in Marvel Cinematic Universe (Spiderman: Far from Home)"
3531,"The waiting turns out to be worth it. Endgame is a satisfying, thrilling, dazzling, entertaining finale to MCU's story arch.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is long and the beginning is more about picking up the pieces and dealing with lost, thus it's purposely paced much slower than the rest. But that is the reason exactly why the movie is so emotionally impactful. After the final battle and all the sacrifices that were made, the silence was palpable in the theater.[換行字元][換行字元]I can't find any scene, character, or dialogue that did not serve a purpose here.[換行字元][換行字元]This is a wondeful action movie, a brilliance of special effects, and a masterpiece of a superhero movie. The MCU's crowning jewel.[換行字元][換行字元]10/10"
3532,"This movie was so good from every point of view: the characters developed so beautifully, the image of the villain was so well built it was impossible to stand him, the sountracks perfectly chosen, the ending to die for! Admittedly, I am not a Marvel fan and I did not watch any movie besides the first 3 Avengers ones. But I loved it anyway!"
3533,"Having huge shoes to fill off the success of Infinity War, Endgame delivers a surprising and resounding result of great writing and thought out plot. From start to finish this film slams you with emotion and even a large amount of comedy. It's a slow burn as far as action goes, for the first half of the movie which I didn't like at first. However after viewing it a second time I see the reasoning behind the build up and drama. It's nice how we didn't know what would happen moment to moment. And each obstacle felt real and dire. This film wasn't perfect and certain things sort of pissed me off and I didn't like how some characters were misused and disrespected. Although these movies are meant to be light hearted and fun at the end of the day. The ending and the overall feel of the film was absolutely amazing. It's hard to compare this film to Infinity War, they're two completely different movies. Infinity War was definitely the brawn and Endgame was the brains of the two movies. Both had very different energies and pacing. I can't decide which is better. Whatever the case, this is a huge success to this franchise and to this studio for pulling off an amazing feat. Well done."
3534,"I've been waiting for this film since April 2018 after Infinity War. I've read theories etc and the anxiety skyrocketed the two weeks leading up to the opening. Now that I've seen it I can say think Infinity War might be a 'better' film but that might only be because of the unique nature of it (the heroes having lost and the villain trying to be impartial). I think people who don't pay attention to the dialog in End Game will need to see the film more than once. On first glance even avid MCU fans well versed in all the films will say 'wait, but,....' until you remember what the characters who have spent time in space explain to those who have not.... so without spoiling thing folks might need to look at diagrams relative to the film ""Primer"" to fully understand what is being exercised in End Game."
3535,"When they said ""it's made by fans, for the fans"" they really meant that. I've been reading comics my entire life and it was amazing to see all these things come to life on the big screen me and my friends would say "" hey wouldn't it be cool if they did blank"" and stuff like that well that's exactly what they did it was honestly worth the wait"
3536,"Between the hype , expectations and the facts .. i can -with a clear consciousness - call this an extremely overrated movie .."
3537,"Yay! This ends the marvel movie franchise! What? It's doesn't. Ugh. Oh well, at least this wraps up a lot, ends the major villain plot, has a few laughs, and gives everyone a moment to shine. Sure it has a million logic and continuity flaws, but who cares when you're breezing through so fast. Doesn't feel like three hours and well worth watching. That said, I never want to see another marvel movie let alone re-watch one."
3538,"The storyline being absolutely terrible is almost unrepairable. However, they do try and fail. The bjg problem is it's finally clear the choppiness and flow are off due secrecy and too much outsourcing. In order to obacure the plot, different companies are awarded different CGI scenes without ever being told the whole enchilada so that they can't leak anything... Of course this method requires there to be a very strong movie plot to begin with or you end up with chop suey. This movie has a few moments of good laughs and one liners... And that's it. It's a total and complete failure."
3539,So Avengers Endgame . Without giving any of the film away. If the first part was a 10 this is only a 6.5. Overlong. Boring in parts. Lazy writing and the end does not make sense. You will see. I was so looking forward to it. Don't believe the hype
3540,I would give 8/10 an marvelous ending given to the movie. I only have one complaint ...comedy was unnecessary filled in scenes where there is no need for comedy.
3541,This huge amounts of charecters made the main story something you lose yourself within it and dont know whats going on really in the infinity war they gave some logic to the idea of evil side of the story but again in this part they show it as something just want to destroy with its primitive ideas its realy unfair to compare this one time seen movie to batman. joker the movie one can see many times and still be enjoyed as you was seening it for the first time
3542,"Probably the best Marvel movie, and one of the best movies there is."
3543,The movie starts with a recap of Infinity wars (Thanos' snap) and its aftermath but soon shifts to the real motive of the movie. The pace of the movie is perfect with emotional moments throughout. The characters are all well developed. The war scene gives you goosebumps; the theme music is awesome and the VFX freaking good. The ending will make you cry. I would definitely rewatch the movie!
3544,"First off, I'm going to try and keep this as spoiler free as possible. I may talk about some aspects but I'll try and keep the *BIG* things a surprise. Ok...now that's out of the way...[換行字元][換行字元]This is not a film for the casual viewer. And I know that may seem like a dumb statement to make about the 4th Avengers film in a hugely successful franchise (you'd think everyone has seen everything) but obviously there are some people out there who might just go to the big team up movies or maybe just go to their favourite character's movie or...might be dragged along by a friend who's the fan. This movie is not a stand-alone. It's such a love letter to the MCU in general. There's so many different easter eggs and nods to previous films that you'd greatly benefit if you've been a fan since day 1. Tying to that, this film did a good job of sending off and tying up certain character's storylines. It made me very emotional. Prepare to cry buckets. The film also has a theme around ""family"" which I thought I was nice too. there's so many great moments and quips that i'd love to talk about more. But as a Cap stan I can say I fully feel satisfied with his scenes. Although, I felt satisified with mostly everyone in this movie. The only characters that I felt got a bit of the shaft were Captain Marvel, Valkryie and Okoye. They werent in it as much as I was expecting...but again I understand that this movie was really supposed to be a swan song for the Avengers and therefore they wanted to focus more on them.[換行字元][換行字元]So, there wasnt much I didnt like in this film. It did leave with some questions around the logisitics of how things worked. There was also one really eye-rolling scene where they say ""She's not alone"" and every female walks onto screen. I get it...""girl power"" yay...but it felt really forced.[換行字元][換行字元]All in all though i thought this movie was just such a great end to 11 years in the making. If you're a fan you wont be disappointed."
3545,"Look, all I want to write is that this is an amazing movie. Slowly builds up, but when it takes off, it takes off. The entire theater was in laughter during many scenes and the entire theater was in tears a couple times due to sadness!! Not too fond of the ending, but that's how most movies go. Go see it (not in 3D because nothing jumped out. The very beginning with Stark in space is cool in 3D, but nothing else)."
3546,Avengers Endgame is the best movie ever made. Every second of this movie is fantastic.[換行字元][換行字元]Saw it a second time and I noticed so many new things that I did not the first time. This is really the best movie of the year so far and the best movie ever made.
3547,This review is being written and submitted 30 minutes after viewing the movie.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie had it all. And it is worth watching it. And all the previous Marvel movie's are worth a marathon for Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]I loved every second of it. And it always had me thinking about each character individually.[換行字元][換行字元]Each one brings something to every Avengers movie's And all the extras do the same.[換行字元][換行字元]This is my first ever review and that says a lot.[換行字元][換行字元]Watch this movie everybody
3548,The Film is actually very well made. But also very Predictable. And you definetliy have to wach the other avengers movies before because otherwise you would Not Understand Most of the Jokes
3549,"Honestly, I think there are too many Heroes for one movie so Thanos definitely helped us out. That said, the writers do exceptionally well to weave all the back stories, relationships, characters and emotional hee-haw together in one crazy 3 hour rollercoaster ride of CG action, emotion and gags.[換行字元][換行字元]Great fun but I yearn for the simpler single hero movies of yore, even though I still think the first Avengers movie was the Greatest!!![換行字元][換行字元]That said, this will break every box office record as it is a MUST SEE!!!"
3550,"Reasonably entertaining, but oddly paced, and perhaps too many characters to keep up to speed with. Enjoyable, but my least favourite in the Avengers series."
3551,"Don't get me wrong, this movie was great, but ways off from being the masterpiece almost everyone says it is."
3552,"why is this a good movie?. In the half of the playtime i was bored and already wondering, that they needed another hour and a half to tell the story behind this. I don' t want to spoiler anything and i'll remain quiet until the movie's airing is completed. But once you have seen it, please try to answer this simple question: ""why was this a good movie to you?"""
3553,"Much peculation was in the air bout' outcome of End Game. Seen the movie have to say I'm satisfied and thrilled how things came to be. It's a long movie, but I didn't notice it, felt like normal length, cause so much was going on thru the movie. Marvel promised us a spectacle and they delivered it. Best movie this year that I have seen, and best of Marvels movies. Few sad momentst for wiever but also relief and explanations for our questions for the future. To top this Marvel and others have a lot to do. Few weeks rest and it's JW's time to show new tricks"
3554,It lacked many of the major events that we were wanting for
3555,"What a movie , thank you stan lee and all Marvel's Team for this great work"
3556,Very good finishing and a lot of excitement. The death of IRON Man and Natasha Romanoff was too much painful.
3557,This film is a Super Movie but if you didnt watch other avengers Movies dont watch it. It full of wonderfull moments like the war of thanos
3558,"Best of best super hero movie ever seen . especially the way of story telling connect all the old marvel movies. emotional , laugh & action .... Cap , Iron man & Natasha are best"
3559,A fun ride! End game is full of spectacular performances and action. The film has plenty of surprises so stay away from spoilers before seeing it.
3560,"Liked the CGI , acting, story..... But didn't quite digest the termination of a main character..."
3561,"The Russo Brothers prove themselves equal to their nigh insurmountable task in this expertly balanced centrepiece to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that both pays homage to the past eleven years of films and sends the universe in bold new directions. There is a weight of consequence to everything that happens but it never allows itself to become too morose or sombre without a sting of classic Marvel wit, and it harmonises this more grim tone with a level of glorious action hitherto undreamt of; bringing a number of intertwining story arcs we've followed and become invested in for years to the most satisfying of conclusions."
3562,"I'm speechless !!! What an incredible way to end this journey!! It's unbelievable how the whole theater gets quieter , laugh or whatever emotions come out , everybody feel it full hearted !! Congratulations guys !!! YOU ROCK !!!!"
3563,"Ah, humanity.. if the collective decides that something is good, cool and great, it sees it through tragically twisted perspective. This time, everyone just seems to fall under the brainwashing hype train of this whole Marvel cinematic universe cultural farce. Let's just shut our brains off and ignore the absolutlely OVERWHELMING amount of stupidity and shallow, fake pathetics that these plots and heroes present us with.[換行字元][換行字元]Not me! I'll say that the Infinity War was actually good, this was far too much of a brain hurting cringefest."
3564,"After Infinity War I was waiting for marvelous final in End Game, but Marvel surprised me in negative way. They finished one the greatest franchise ever as drama and tragedy. They added so many dialogues that some people has been falling asleep. After dynamical Infinity War they gave us a so slow motion film. And finally, that what they did with Captain America it's a disaster for time theory!"
3565,I am a long time fan of Marvel and this movie is INCREDIBLE to say the least ! Watched it 7 times and will watch again and again . It is a MUST SEE
3566,"One thing I did before seeing endgame was to avoid all teaser and trailers and spoilers. With that said, I had no idea about what I am going in to see apart from what I had imagined in my mind as to what's going to happen next and I can tell you that most of what I had thought really did not happen that way. I would advise to watch a recap of MCU on YouTube and do watch Infinity War once more to refresh your memory. Just like infinity war, the movie starts right off the bat, moving story forward in a well paced manner. Since movie is three hours long they divided the movie into three sections, all sections well used:[換行字元][換行字元]1. Gather the avengers 2. Make and execute the plan 3. Final battle[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is so well paced that the three hours just went by and there is not a single moment where you will lose your interest or get bored. The best part about the movie is the way how the past Marvel movies are connected to this one will be a surprise treat for you. Marvel has done justice to bring Thanos to big screen and given him two movie to fully show what he actually is capable of doing. He is no joke and you will see it in the later part of the movie. He is the baddest villain and the final battle has proved it.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie was not all about action, as a matter of fact only last part of the movie is action yet still the movie manages to hold its audiences with a bunch of surprises and to the edge of their seat during final battle. The mission are also going to keep you tight on your seat. The movie is full of humor thanks to Rocket and Thor and Iron man. Surprisingly Hulk has some great comic moments as well.[換行字元][換行字元]At the end the movie pays homage to previous marvel movies and their characters whose story ends with Endgame however they could be back anytime if Marvel wants them to. This is one in a life time movie that you will remember. Don't miss it and watch it in theater."
3567,"The movie was AWESOME! Full of funny moments, emotions... Been waiting for this movie and it really paid out!"
3568,Even if i knew the story i would still go to watch this Movieeee ...It can be watched over and over without stop its so Good.
3569,"This lives up to its name, great movie. Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat, every part was worth watching."
3570,"The ending of all the marvel films is in this film.It is worth an Oscar.Each and every shot is taken with perfection and it will surely send chills down your spine.It is unparalleled,uncomparable or peerless to any film in the history and surely in the future too.The greatest film ,the marvel fans have ever witnessed.The Oscar is made for #ENDGAME.#Avenge the fallen#Avengers Assemble!!!!!!!!!"
3571,"Best Superhero Movie Ever You Will Cry, Laugh, And In The End Of The Movie You Will Be Shocked.[換行字元][換行字元]You Must Watch It"
3572,Greatest end to the greatest experiment in movie history.
3573,"No doubts about this one. Graphics, script, anticipation all make this movie the best super hero movie of all time. Every character you could ever love and more is involved in some way. It's a closure on a chapter in cinematic history we've never seen before. 11 years 23 movies all built up to this point and it didn't disappoint.[換行字元][換行字元]All of the speculation on how this movie would play out. Though I'm quite sure anyone guess was right. Marvel stuck somewhat to form with the comics but as always went their own route too. The movie has plenty of twist and turns and laughter to go along. If you've been a fan of this series since it's inception with Iron man. You won't leave disappointed but you may not leave happy either. I could not recommend a movie more to go to the theatre and see.[換行字元][換行字元]I think this movie is in a group of its own. And hopefully will be rewarded come awards time. Every aspect in my opinion was just fantastic. I can't think of anything really that didn't make this movie perfect. I applaud the directors, screen writers, actors, actresses and everyone that's involved. I'll end up my non spoiler with this....I love you 3000...with tears in my eyes."
3574,Good but a bit overrated movie by marvel fans. I was excited before watching the movie but after watching the movie not meeting my expections.
3575,I only have one thing to say.. Thank you Marvel for being part of this incredible journey. The movie was EPIC. A perfect way to end an era !!!
3576,"Well it's been a hell of a wait since Infinity War, but the Russo Brothers have delivered in spectacular style and quality.[換行字元][換行字元]I loved this film in all its entirety and encourage everyone who goes see it to do a toilet check before the titles roll.[換行字元][換行字元]It is an immense roller-coaster with many twists and turns.[換行字元][換行字元]The studio keeps getting better and I hope it continues for years to come. Don't be dissuaded by the feature length of just over 3 hours, this is a MARVELlous spectacle for all to see![換行字元][換行字元]Make mine Marvel True Believers!! Full marks."
3577,"Masterpiece, end of an era. Great movie. The best marvel-movie ever made."
3578,"It was an epic, funny & emotional conclusion to the 11 years of the MCU. It's probably one of the most 'comic booky' film next to Spider Verse."
3579,"A great superhero movie from adventure to action! I never thought it would be this good. Thanos is the best enemy I've ever seen! From the emotional scene to the epic scene, whatever I say is empty! Don't miss out on this movie! Get your ticket now! An epic end![換行字元][換行字元]⭐ 100/82"
3580,"Finally got to watch the most anticipated movie, the saga that continued to never cease to amaze us from 12 years. I had never seen a movie like this until today. I have sore my throat during the ending. I don't want to spoil it so please must go and grab your tickets."
3581,"Solid, action packed, well written epic!! Excellent end to a phenomenal series!"
3582,"This is everything i ever wanted in this movie, and i didnt even know I wanted most of it. Real tear-jerker at times, and when you laugh its not forced. Its a three-hour epic but it feels like half that time. I can genuinely say that this is my favorite movie of all time. Congratulations, Marvel. This cannot be beaten."
3583,Meh...could have made better use of the superheroes
3584,"The movie is very slow not much action. all talking, all a bit boring really, NOT AS GOOD AS INFINITY WAR"
3585,"This was one of the best Marvel films ever, it was a great watch, and as someone who has complete invested into the MCU, I can say that this was a greta finish to a great film series."
3586,"The final chapter of Marvel's Phase Three of the MCU has everything that a fan of these movies wants! It has an ending for the ages and Easter eggs to many to count. It took 21 movies to get there, so filled with to the brim with callbacks to previous movies and it gives a ending to numerous story arcs in a satisfied way. As usual, Marvel knocks it out of the park with a blockbuster that looks impressive, has an incredible cast, iconic characters and a story that will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat for all of the 3 hour run-time."
3587,Gonna keep it simple here.. The movie is awesome.. Some people may say the movie got plotholes here and there but no.. The plotholes are negligible.. And all make senses. Better than Infinity Wars.. And i don't know what future lies ahead after the ending of Endgame. Would it be better with new line? I hope so.. But this movie really sum up all the hard work of 11 years of MCU. Thank You RDJ for starting all of this.
3588,"An epic film in size and enjoyment. Everyone involved with this film deserves a standing ovation. Many films are hyped up to a hysterical point but then fail to deliver! However when it comes to EndGame, there will be little to criticise in this epic conclusion to a generation worth of mostly brilliant films!"
3589,"This movie is beyond expectations. There is tons of Emotions, Extraordinary style of direction, Flaws , Actions !!! There is gonna be a lot of jaw dropping scenes.. No matter how much you resist but you gonna love it.. I think this is a Masterpiece in the history of cinema.. Go enjoy with your Family, Friends and DON'T get too emotional like me😭"
3590,"Best way to develop,to coordinate all characters... Best way to direct all these guys together... Love u MCU"
3591,"Here, the film started rather slowly (that's to be expected as the characters and their actions were being setup) and quiet unusual by now for any marvel movie; but when the action does start, It completely blew away whatever was served in IW![換行字元][換行字元]The time travel aspect can be confusing and does more harm and the représentation of some characters are the only thing lacking, that's not to say there aren't genuine development given to some, also, I think Marvel should stick to using soundtracks for epic tent pole like this instead of smorgasbord of music.[換行字元][換行字元]First time I'll be giving reviews, YES, it that's good!"
3592,"For a series in the Marvel universe that started fairly bland, MCU's Avengers: Endgame brings out everything that makes it stand out. Characters were solid, all respected their role in the plot and not one of the dialogues between them was redundant. Plot kept its pacing, coherence and more importantly its continuation from Infinity War which is essentially Part 1 of this movie. This is one the weird movies that doesnt soely rely on its own 1hr 30 mins narrative to drive a plot, but takes privileges from the movies that came before and neatly tie everything down, its clever and well executed, i honestly wish there were more moments like this in the MCU. No spoilers so its short, this is a movie that deserve praise, 10/10 for perfect sequel."
3593,"For a movie that was advertised as the ultimate ending to the 3rd phase of Marvel's superheroes, I was a bit disappointed. It took 1.5 hrs to actually get started, involved a lot of nonsensical crying and weak build-up to the real story. The action was quite engaging but when the wizards finally teleported everyone onto the battlefield, it was too confusing because you barely knew where anyone was in relation to everyone else. Too much SJW pandering, but what else do you expect from Disney and Marvel nowadays, quality content with serious issues being treated seriously?[換行字元][換行字元]I like the movie for what it truly was - the ending to a great saga. But let's not kid ourselves - this is a kids movie with tons of product placement. It had some great action, but the best one was the practical stunts and fight choreography, not the CGI moments in front of green screens. Could have been a full hour shorter and with less fake tear-jerking moments that actually had no true value other than they were fully forced upon viewers. Also, many of the emotional moments were ruined by stupid jokes, and the great jokes were sparse. I am glad it's over."
3594,"One of my new favorite marvel films of all time, you can tell it's my favorite cause I've seen it so many times to the point where I know the film by heart. I know crazy right, any way all you need to know is this films awesome, amazing, action, sad in a happy way, exciting or how ever you want to call it this badass films got it all. The ten year wait is finally over with an amazing ending to show for it thanks Stan Lee for making these character."
3595,"This really is a character driven film that will make you laugh, gasp and almost certainly cry...the less you know about this movie the better it is. Probably not the best marvel film but it is the perfect ending to a monumental franchise that will be like the original star wars trilogy in 20 years time. It's definitely not a masterpiece, very few movies are, but it is easy to dwell on these flaws rather than looking at the bigger picture. Whether you've been following these characters since the beginning or have only recently got into it, this movie won't disappoint and as everyone keeps saying, it is so god damn emotionally satisfying!"
3596,Just watch it. It is amazing. Especially if you are invested in this Avengers/Marvel universe
3597,"A worthy ending of ten year film history that was made! A absolutely stunning, great, funny and emotional film."
3598,"The movie story has the potential to present in a scale and level of magnitude that every MCU fan expects. Sadly, this movie lacks what was achieved with every avenger movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Too much of conversations and drama makes you bore at times and lack of interesting action sequences brings down the watching experience. It is full of overhyped and overrated by many people by calling it as an Epic.[換行字元][換行字元]Trust me, it is worth to watch every other Marvel movies and this movie don't stand a chance to provide the level of entertainment for fans like us.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie has not reached to our fans expectations.

3599,"Let me start by saying THIS is how you wrap a saga!!!! I loved this movie, it was an emotional rollercoaster from open to close, and a fitting way to pay tribute to the legend of Stan Lee."
3600,Totally best movie. captain america. ironeman. thor. captain marvel are really awesome
3601,"Thank God I *didn't* see this on Thursday night like I originally wanted to. Man, did I feel every...single...one of those 181 minutes.[換行字元][換行字元]Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. Some scenes were definitely funny, some touched me tremendously and I had a huge warmth in my heart for nostalgia for the other MCU chapters. But, boy...one full hour could've been cut and the tightened film would've been so much better.[換行字元][換行字元]My father, who joined me during this film, had not seen Avengers 3a (ah-hem, ""Infinity War."") So, before this 3b part (aka: ""Endgame,"") I took roughly 10 seconds to explain that first part to this conclusion movie. I summed up 2½ hours of footage...in 10 seconds. He didn't think it sounded like a good movie, to which I corrected him. Part 3a was a great movie and you never felt those 2½ hours because it was chock-full of action, almost non-stop. Just because it had a basic premise, it still had depth and so much going on, you should be on the edge of your seat the entire film.[換行字元][換行字元]And the opposite is true here. This is what I recall feeling when I watched Kill Bill Vol 2. I was so excited because Kill Bill Vol 1 was so action-packed and fun, I was looking forward to the same in the concluding volume. Nope. The breaks were put on from like 90mph to 15.[換行字元][換行字元]Again, don't get me wrong. I really did enjoy both Kill Bill Vol. 2 and this Avengers 3b movie. It's just not what I expected in the least. It's definitely well made, thought out and has all the elements you desire. It just takes such a long time to get the goods. And by goods, I'd say, aside from all the one-off great scenes of comedy/reminiscence, the climax had me almost out of my seat, clapping and cheering.[換行字元][換行字元]The neat part of this experience was the aftermath. Rarely do we get to see the actual destruction after an evil villain actually succeeds like Thanos did in Part 3a. 3b is that movie. This is the What-If-Comes-Sadly-True. And I enjoyed that idea a bit until the movie finally kicks in - about an hour or so in.[換行字元][換行字元]Not gonna ruin any specifics, but suffice to say, the movie's, naturally, about the Avengers attempting to figure out how to win after the last movie's defeat. Kinda like Return of the Jed-I to The Empire Strikes Back. (Though...Star Wars Episode VI does a much better job of the same story.)[換行字元][換行字元]Is this a recommendation? Of course. Go and slam your money down and get a ticket. There is absolutely zero reason to NOT see this if you've seen Part 3a or, hell, any of the other MCU. But, maybe just once. Okay, twice, with the second time at home to catch anything you might have missed. And keep in mind, overall it's best to have seen ALL 21 prior movies to really appreciate/understand this one.[換行字元][換行字元]***[換行字元][換行字元]Final thoughts: Whew! I think I did it. I think I wrote a completely spoiler-free review. These kinds of movies takes me off social media the whole week leading up to my weekend viewing as I am worried about spoilers. I guess, you're welcome."
3602,"THIS IS A NON SPOILER REVIEW Avengers Endgame picks up where Infinity War has ended. It's full of story, full of heart and full of respect for the characters that we know and love profoundly. It's also beautiful to look at and has much better editing than most of Marvel. There are beautiful long shots and it's a spectacular view. If you love Marvel, if you have seen all (and in this case I recommend seeing all MCU movies before this one - trust me, it will help you understand many parts) then you are probably going to love this. And the marketing did do it justice - it really feels like an end of an era."

3604,"Everything about this movie is EPIC. The drama, action, comedy and most of all, the passion. I left the cinema speechless, the cast were all on top form, the Russo brother's have saved there best work til last. I can see why the critics are raving and why the reviews on here are so good. Thankyou Marvel."
3605,Loved this movie as I have loved all other Avengers movies...bar one..Captain Marvel. So glad she (Brie Larson) was only in it for a short time or I would have scored it less. Loved the humour and the old familiar Avenger Heroes. Chris Helmsworth was hilarious. Robert Downey Jnr was brilliant as were the others.
3606,"From the beginning of the film until the end will leave you mesmerize. There was no boring scenes. The cinematography, score, CGI, music, acting and jokes are superb. Every action scenes, fears and hopes from this film will exceeds your expectations. This is the fastest 3 hours in my life. I really appreciate the creative management behind this film. They deserve to win an Oscar awards for next year. To all the people who are involved in this film, thank you for making this one-of-a-kind movie of the century. Most importantly, thank you Stan Lee. Excelsior!"
3607,I am Big fan of marvel From India .This film Is Emotionally Connected With Us. As we Were waited for 11 Years Is Now Ended Here.
3608,"If marvel isn't your thing then I completely understand why you mightn't like this movie but even those people should still be able to appreciate the sheer brilliance of this movie . For the fans this will feel like every second and penny you have invested into these movies have been repaid in 3 hours of well thought out entertainment. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat throughout the full run time. The cgi is remarkable as is the acting , one of the highlight for me is Josh Brolin as Thanos who just like the first movie steals every scene he's in but one can't look past Robert Downey jr. who sums up everything he's put into his character in the last ten years. If you haven't seen this movie then what are you waiting for? Best off seeing it as soon as possible before someone ruins it by spoiling it. 10/10"
3609,Characters: 9/10 Story (counts twice): 8/10 Direction/Visuals: 9/10 Impression: 8/10[換行字元][換行字元]Overall: 42/50 or 8/10
3610,From the beginning to end the characters are very alive and at the beginning we never going to believe that is gonna happened but it does and after that the movie been a roller coaster and the climax is the generator of goosebumps and at end for me its a pain to dilute the truth. Over all its an perfect ending to the greatest franchise in marvel universe.
3611,"This was the first movie i watched in Cinema, O! Yes you heard me right and i didn't regret going to the cinemas to watch the fantastic movie. It was really great movie and it has left a great memory inside me...Thanks Marvel for this great master piece."
3612,"If you build it, he will come. Those words from the ""Field of Dreams"", came to mind after I finished watching it's last night. Without a doubt, a perfect ending for an era for a team of a beloved superheroes. Those three phases of building up to this moment in my mind, actually can be counted as one huge incredible project building up for this moment. Despite its ups and downs, this entire project can be considered as a great work of cinematic art, which gave us many hours of interest, speculations and pure enjoyment. Even the worst movies of the universe so far, which are captain Marvel and Thor 2, fall into their place as a bit unpolished pieces of the puzzle. The movie itself wasn't perfect story wise, there are some story loopholes, but it worked perfectly on many many levels. The only thing that bothered me, was out of character, pure ""strong woman power"" moment in the last battle, which is so popular in the movies these days, as this moment actually goes against the spirit of the movie, which basically all light against all darkness at the end. Despite this minor glitch, I gave it a pure 10/10 as a work of cinematic art, which concluded over a decade of hard work. Shame, Stan Lee is not alive to see his vision come to live on screen. He would love that."
3613,Predictable Boring Nothing Thnos 😹 How stupid 🙈🙈
3614,Avengers infinity War was one of those heart stopping movies. It had everything going on and it just worked out perfect. Going into End Game I had high expectations and was sadly disappointed. The movie was very underwhelming. May I even say boring at times.
3615,I can't describe how many emotions went through me during the movie. It was just amazing portrait of what an complex movie should look like :) It was an experience for whole life
3616,"Avengers Endgame gives it's viewers the ultimate emotional rollercoaster ride. I cried, more than once. I Was so Happy when I saw this movie. Every moment of this movie is made to perfection. Strong moments of emotions and happiness throughout the whole movie.[換行字元][換行字元]This is by far my favourite Marvel movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Whatever it takes."
3617,A great end to a great cinematic universe.End of a thrilling journey with our beloved characters.One of the best films ever.
3618,"Excellent movie. No words for this movie. Superb, fantastic comedy, action, suspense,everything is in this movie. Everyone should watch this.. I am a girl and the biggest fan of avengers."
3619,"In a world where power means greed and the ability to destroy as opposed to protect and build. In a world where we tend to categorize and create tension as opposed to finding common good. Why shouldn't we believe in super heroes and the ability to overcome evil through seeking common good, unity and sacrifice. Script was excellent, performance was mind blowing ...Marvel Magic hit home! Everyone was clapping 👏🏼 Standing ovation as the credits rolled I can watch this over and over and over again!!!!! Mind blowing!!!!!!"

3621,Best of the rest Best movie in the world rip iron man......
3622,"Endgame is not only full of expected action, but the plot us unpredictable while being character-driven. Great inclusion of comedy and emotion. This movie brought this era of the MCU full-circle."
3623,The MCU breaks the Record of the world's box office!
3624,An amazing film that' it. no words no words... The final shock me
3625,It was an disappointment! That's all i can say ! Absolute trash
3626,"Unbelievable. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many.[換行字元][換行字元]I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies. I will watch it again and again and again. Love it more than 3000.It leaves you at the edge of your seat and the 3rd act is just insane and a masterpiece. Infinity War was fantastic but this is insanity, in all the right ways. The best series finale that I hoped it would be and then some.[換行字元][換行字元]Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this. It's an experience that You'll remember forever.[換行字元][換行字元]There are times when people were clapping, laughing & crying at the same time. There's also one scene where whole theatre was kept silent because they are so much engaged with the movie. You know that it's a superhero movie and in the end superheroes will win but, how they portray the whole story left everyone in the hall speechless.[換行字元][換行字元]It's Conclusion to a long running Saga & Yes End of an ERA!"
3627,One of the greatest superheros movies ever .. i can't imagine that i'm going to watch another movies less than this amazing work .. thank u marvel
3628,Just and all round epic movie that will keep you hooked the whole way through.
3629,This movie lives up to its hype. It is easily the best superhero movie. It is perfection the Russo brothers executed it perfectly. It will take some time to process it. But overall the movie is the best and is very suprising.
3630,This film served as an ode to 11 years of hard work as shown by the excellent callbacks via time travel. Each major character had their moments to shine. My favorite was the last 40 min fight scene which catered to what the fans wanted.
3631,Ok guys...poor writing..so many plotholes...all messed with the time but nothing changed..i was givin it 5 max but hey....yes in memory of Stan Lee..
3632,"You will not believe what this movie contains. Everything is awesome. And I guess after this movie now no avengers movie will be made. All heros will stay forever in all of our hearts. Hats off to directors, producers and all cast and crew who devoted their everything to make this movie fully awesome #whateverITtakes"
3633,"If there's also any single phrase that sums up the guiding principle of the Marvel Cinematic Universe it's this: Hold that thought. (Truth be told, with Endgame's running time of three hours, ""hold that bladder"" would also apply.)[換行字元][換行字元]But the bottom line is that it's as hilarious as mush as it is Heartbreaking.[換行字元][換行字元]It's helpful, before going to see Endgame, to cast your mind back to the contradictory feelings of that final scene. This one focuses on the efforts of Cap and the remaining Avengers to implement a do-over - essentially rewinding the effects of Thanos' snap - feels at once sad and deeply satisfying, complicated and surprisingly comic. If many of us have grown up with the MCU, the films themselves have also grown more complex, like a fine wine.[換行字元][換行字元]In a sense, Endgame is an example of the MCU cannibalizing itself, but it has always done so. And it does so here in a fresh way that is closer to homage than lazy appropriation. These affectionate flashbacks also serve as a tip of the hat to all the loyal fans who have held this sprawling mythology so dear.[換行字元][換行字元]Spoiler Alert? Sure! THOR IS FAT!!![換行字元][換行字元]As high as the stakes are in Endgame, it is also a very funny movie. The humor of the story - some of which takes place in the future, five years after the end of ""Infinity War"" - has to do with surprising ways in which the lives of certain characters have changed (along with their personalities and, in some cases, their physiques). If Infinity War was about failure, Endgame is, ironically, all about acceptance and moving on. After 11 long years, the Infinity Saga is finally, fulfillingly over.[換行字元][換行字元]There is no post-credit scene. But oh, what a going-away party these old friends have thrown for themselves. You'd certainly be in more tears then you were during Infinity war's climax. Tears of joy for most, that is."
3634,"I do not see why everyone was giving the plot of this movie a 1 or 2 star. I can say watching this movie for 3 hours, it tied up all the previous movies all in one bow and left no questions unanswered. I think some viewers wanted more death scenes but for me I was truly satisfied and entertained since watching all the marvel movies at the start of first Ironman. You will definitely try to hold back some tears which I was good at but this movie will try to make you cry. Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did since this is the last avengers saga."
3635,"Terribly disappointed in the effort. There should have been something ""more"". The movie plods from scene to scene with no real tension, almost as if marvel is giving the viewer the cliff notes on the last 10 years of films. Even the end battle was snooze-worthy, including the mostly useless Captain Marvel showing up as the deus ex machina."
3636,"If you expect to watch a movie that is almost as good as Infinity Game then you will be very disappointed... A film that should be at most 90 minutes length it has been pushed at 180 minutes and they felt that time with lot of non-sense talking without action[換行字元][換行字元]Didn't worth the money spent to watch the movie, not even the time.. Even if I was offered to watch it again for free, I would pass the offer without any hesitation.."
3637,Despite what others may say or have said this film was far from predictable. I certainly lost my bets. I both laughed and cried during this film. I loved every minute and none of those minutes were wasted. The writers outdid themselves on this one. I just hope the next ten years can live up to the first. Here's hoping.
3638,"There are no words to describe how I feel after experiencing this. Incredible, incredulous, masterful: none capture the countless shivers and awe one feels when watching this. I will never forget my adventure watching this film. The film is overwhelming with emotion and creates an extremely emotional, happy and sad, conclusion to an 11 year old story. No matter what you're expecting, nothing will prepare you for this."
3639,"Epic opening scene follow by 90 mins of nothing special followed by 80 mins of waves of poor quality to solid quality with a epic final battle scene. So many parts that made zero sense. The more time that goes on the less sense some of the story line makes. I could go on for hours about stuff that was negative and about 15 mins of quality to be spoken of. Look, everyone will watch for themselves. Ultimately disappointing unless your a stubborn baised superfan who believes marvel can do no wrong."
3640,"This movie was amazing from beginning to end and awarded fans who watched all the movies that started with iron man. It may not be perfect to some people but the ones that rated this 1 star simply just don't get what they did and can't appreciate how the tied in 21 other movies into this one. If you look at this movie trying not to like it and don't understand of course you'll rate it 1 star. I'm rating this 10 stars to counter act the 1 stars and I do believe this should be in the ranks of The Godfather and Shawshank redemption it shouldn't matter that it's a ""comic book movie"" or ""superhero movie"" it's a movie that's incredible and should be regarded as such with one of the best if not the best villain in all of cinema. This movie is a masterpiece and anyone that likes and doesn't like comic book movies will enjoy this because of what this movie is. A masterpiece"
3641,"With hopes and expectations reaching sky-high, the Russo-brothers directed movie doesn't let you down at any point of this mega-delight. Has a lot of moments for whistles and cheers, and also the ones to make you emotional. Goosebumps throughout the movie. Perfectly set in what could be confusing timelines(but the Russos managed it quite handsomely). Visual treat, actors were in their A-game, drama set on the highest of notes, larger than life visuals, background scores keep you totally invested, and the tried and tested formula of superhero humour is an icing on cake. Package of nostalgia and a step into phase 4 with goodbye to few of our favourite characters makes this one of best superhero movies made till date. After 11 years 21 movies, MARVEL STUDIOS still pulls of an extraordinary flick."
3642,"Firstly, as you read the reviews on IMDB you see a lot of people dropping reviews which do not make sense and basically people who have no understanding of what this film signifies.[換行字元][換行字元]I'll explain this movie as brief as I can...[換行字元][換行字元]If you haven't watched the other marvel movies which lead up to this film, then, watching this film is similar to arriving at a football match (soccer) which has 10 minutes left to be played and expecting to understand how the teams have scored their goals, how a player has gotten an injury, how a team has only 9 players left on the pitch instead of 11, where the coach is, why isn't he on his usual stand and oh why has 1 team got an originally outfield player dressed up as a goal keeper and defending the goal post.[換行字元][換行字元]You just won't get it and by the time the match ends, you'll say it was all mumbled up and everything seemed confusing for your brain.[換行字元][換行字元]Plain and simple, Avengers: Endgame, is a MASTERPIECE, it wasn't made for you. It was made those who have been there for the MCU from the first minute of the match and this football match I'm afraid started 11 years ago! I implore you to not listen to those coming in to give their opinion just from having a vague understanding of the whole thing.[換行字元][換行字元]I've seen the movie twice at the cinema and both times had hair raising moments as well as new things discovered. Also both times I overheard a couple of times someone sitting a few seats from me, ask, ""oh who's this person? And that person was Captain Marvel. Another time, the person asked, oh who's this one now? And that person was Peter Quill aka Star Lord. So that tells you how many people would be doing the same worldwide and still wanna blurt their poorly built opinion about the hard work put into this film.[換行字元][換行字元]As I write this, the film is on the way to becoming the highest grossing film and has broken records State side, China and in the rest of the world. Not watching this movie is you simply depriving yourself from an amazing feast of entertainment. If you haven't seen the other movies, you still have time, YOU HAVE TO WATCH THEM BEFORE THIS. And for those who have seen the other marvel films since 2008 and simply need a recap, there's tons of videos online which helps you remember things in a nice and brief way. Thank me later. 10/10"
3643,So Avengers Endgame was the most epic Marvel movie I've ever seen it's a celebration of all the movies in the MCU leading up to Avengers Endgame and it was a walk down memory lane the entire movie and it's filled with references only people who have been around since the beginning will understand and get and yes it's 3 hours but every second of this movie is worth your time I've seen it now 3 times and still wanna see it AGAIN! I don't want to spoil anything but basically it's awesome!
3644,"Tamed Hulk, traumatized Ironman, fantasy of yesterday - Cap America. what did I do with my hair - Cpt Marvel . Dr Stranger things and many more with fault of not their own were part of the final movie in one of the most successful and entertaining spectacles of the past decade.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie itself was a huge collection of familiar faces and scenes, from all major events in MCU, lacking cohesive structure which distorted flow of the movie. The spectacle was too long and action sequences were unevenly spaced which created over too long moments that were more about homage to the last decade of superhero bonanza and tremendous logistic achievement. After all getting all of the cameo actors from the last movies and inserting them into this plot must have been very difficult. Did they suceed ? No, they did not. The effort was admirable and gave us some really touching moments but resulted in unnecessary extending already too long movie. This was confusing the main story plot too much. There were just too much of it. Movie did not offer viewer any spectacular skirmishes in a first two hours. Thats what made IW so special. Endgage was lacking these impactful moments. It is clear that the best was saved for last but this only validates that movie did not have to be so long. If a movie would be filled with IW level of awesome than yeah, bring it on but the problem is that it was stretched too thin and these moments are just not there, not in the beginning anyway.[換行字元][換行字元]PG-12 rating is a culprit here. If movie's rating was higher I am sure that scenes filled with nothing would be at least more electryfying but because this is a movie aimed at future and former fans, the lighter representation of after apocalypse universe was the only thing Disney corporate machine could have come up with and still get away with achieving PG-12 rating. Younger audience and older audience looked bored in the cinema though. The balance was not achieved here.[換行字元][換行字元]The final stand off was amazing though and I will say that it is worth the price of admission. When I will be rematching Endgame on blue ray I think I will just skip to the last few chapters just to experience all this wonderfully done explosions and amazingly done fights. It was just epic and the team definitely raised the bar here.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall the movie was ok but it did not top IW for me. This one will still be the best Avenger movie."
3645,"It has been eleven years and 21 films until this point and whether or not you have been a fan of each and every film or not, it's undeniable that what producer Kevin Feige has been spearheading all these years is unprecedented and will probably be at least another decade until something like this is even attempted again. Even though Avengers: Infinity War felt like every storyline was colliding last year, Avengers: Endgame is the true finale of what they are now calling the Infinity Saga. Beginning with Iron Man in 2008 and finishing with Avengers: Endgame in 2019, this is a franchise that was made for fans of this newfound genre in superhero filmmaking and Avengers: Endgame is a near-perfect conclusion in every way.[換行字元][換行字元]Picking up shortly after the events of Avengers: Infinity War (and don't worry, I won't be spoiling anything from this movie), we meet the team at their lowest point in the entire franchise. The first act of this film is really just about them coping, but shimmers of hope begin to arise, giving them ideas and possibilities for a new future going forward. The journey this film takes you on is absolutely astounding and there are some moments that will have you thinking the franchise has officially peaked, but I feel that fans have earned those moments for being invested through thing many films. There's honestly only so much to say without ruining the experience, so I'll move on to some specifics here.[換行字元][換行字元]Robert Downey Jr. has always been great as Tony Stark, but due to the circumstances left by the previous film, I truly don't think he's ever been as good on-screen as he is in this film. He carries the emotional weight of the film on his shoulders and I just wanted to applaud every second he was on camera. On top of that, everyone from Karen Gillan (Nebula) getting more Tod do than she has ever done, to Chris Evans truly earning back his character's name, to even Jeremy Renner, who hasn't exactly had many standout moments until now, every cast member brings their all here and I could go on for days about how Avengers: Endgame features the most devoted cast any of these films have seen. I would also like to commend Scarlett Johansson, as it has been years since I've seen her this committed to a character.[換行字元][換行字元]Audiences will flock to this movie hoping for a lot of big-budget spectacle, and although there are some of the craziest sequences in the franchise thus far, I have to admit that fans of drama will also probably appreciate this movie more than most of the films in the franchise. The impact the previous film has on this movie is severe and it really shows throughout the first two acts. From some great cinematography and new visuals we've yet to see until now, this is the definition of a film that has it all.[換行字元][換行字元]There's so much I would like to dive into here, but I'll just say this is the definition of a movie that people dream up when watching a franchise. Story threads are tied up nicely, the spectacle is dialled up to a million, the performances are probably the best that this franchise has ever seen, and the humour is absolutely still present and well-balanced with the drama in a way that feels needed for this heavy movie. Overall, Avengers: Endgame isn't a perfect movie, because really, no film of this size can truly be perfect, but this was one of the best theatre-going experiences I've had in years. This is a true finale that earns every second of it's three hour run time. Here's to a bright future for the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
3646,"Better than infinity war. Ending is very emotional, and is very shocking. Wow, just Wow."
3647,It was good. Just like the last one. But it's not very different from any marvel movie. They have become repetitive and predictable . Many cliches
3648,"I need to be honest.. I love the Marvel universe, but this isn't the best movie. On its own, I'd never rate it this high, but as a part, or end, of the current universe it is ace. Mind blown, total overload and yet it manages from big to small, going from all to one hero in a way that works."
3649,"This film has the best possible ending, and I assure that it is not expected, a culmination of 21 films, 11 years, I believe that never in history can such a thing be repeated. The movie I think is the best of all, and the only negative thing I can say is that it does not have a post-credit scene, otherwise it has epic moments, of tension, of laughter, even tears, I assure you. It's not a movie, it's THE MOVIE."
3650,"If your a Marvel fan, then you've already seen this film, but that doesn't change the fact that it will go down as the greatest conclusion to the biggest build up of movies ever created. It movies gives you exactly what you want as a fan of the franchise and more. I do believe the movie would be difficult to follow if you aren't an avid watcher of the franchise, however it is abundantly clear that those are the kind of people this movie was made for. It gives you some great character moments (the best of the entire MCU), amazing action sequences, some fan service moments, and even the feels. This is one of those films that I feel everyone should go and see for sure. Watch a few of the previous Marvel films to get an understanding of the franchise and then go see Avengers: Endgame and be apart of history."
3651,Just can't say thank you enough to everyone that had a hand at making these movies come to life. What an absolutely beautiful ending to such an amazing journey.
3652,But I never liked super hero movies to to begin with and got suckered in by a couple good Marvel movies.[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]Time travel is a such an easy lazy fix. Only interesting charter was the potbellied super hero that wanted nothing to do with any of it.
3653,"Cheesy and dumb. They could have done so much with this movie, but completely failed. There was WAY to much comedy and PC moments. Definitely a waste of time and money."
3654,"Avengers Endgame is a movie I've been excited for since the end of Infinty War. I purposefully avoided any and all information about the movie, to allow myself to see it without any clear ideas of what to expect. However, while I was surprised, it wasn't of the pleasant variety. Unfortunately there seems to have been some kind of oversight with the writing of one character in particular, which causes the whole movie to fall apart, both in terms and the story and emotional weight.[換行字元][換行字元]Without getting into spoilers, Endgame introduces rules, and not only goes on to break those rules, but completely renders them meaningless to ensure the final set piece can take place. While it was previously mentioned in the movie that resources are limited, so they can only attempt their plan once, a character then goes on to show that they were apparently capable of doing what they were planning to do, seemingly all along. Whether this character knew that or not is up for debate, but it was incredibly distracting and lowered the overall emotional weight and tension.[換行字元][換行字元]This character, for forever reason, also doesn't reveal important information, which only serves to progress the plot. This then leads to the previously mentioned action that completely ignores all the stakes set in place, leaving those in the audience with their brain turned on feeling annoyed.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame attempts to build an emotional story, but due to the ability the previously mentioned character is shown to have, all emotional weight is completely lost. While this movie may have brought tears to the eyes of many, it simply left mine rolling.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame also has a 3 hour runtime, and for at least 2 of those hours you can feel every minute of it. It also doesn't do a great job of juggling all of the talent as a large number of characters server more of a cameo role than anything else. However, the main cast do a fantastic job from start to finish. These talented men and women understand and portray their characters so well, it's easy to forget one is watching actors at all. If I had to praise one aspect of this film it would be the performances.[換行字元][換行字元]While the final battle is interesting, in concept it also raises its share of questions, regarding the power levels of certain characters. While most may be able to overlook these, anyone who has been paying attention well enough will start to wonder if the writers even watched the previous film.[換行字元][換行字元]Furthermore, the story of Thanos in this film completely undermines the spectacular work the previous film did, both by the writers and Josh Brolin. This changes Thanos from one of the most compelling and three dimensional antagonists in modern cinema to a big purple CGI monster who wants to destroy the world.[換行字元][換行字元]It may sound like I hated this film, but I do recommend that every fan of the MCU see it, as it does wrap everything up, so long as you don't think about it too hard."
3655,"Like I said when I reviewed the last film, Infinity War, the Avengers seem to get better with each film (and longer it seems). The Russo brothers have become great storytellers over the last few years, and have been great at keeping the story secret. This film is the culmination of more than twenty films over the past eleven years, and it is extremely epic![換行字元][換行字元]There are some twists and turns in this film that you might not see coming, but are essential to the Avengers story-line. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll love this chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I definitely see this film up for multiple Academy Awards in 2020, maybe even Best Picture; its that good."
3656,"Ive seen all Avengers movies, and yet I havent learned my lesson.... ""These movies are really not for me""... story is super shallow... the ending is so predictable.... im just comparing this trash to the likes of ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy of Christopher Nolan or Spider-Man trilogy of Sam Raimi... these trilogies remain my favorites of all time."
3657,"The first half is bored, the other one is amazing. so, you should see this."
3658,Poogers to directors for auch a great job 3hrs well spent This movie really shiwed where mcu started and where it ia going
3659,"I watched Endgame in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a little of chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing![換行字元][換行字元]It may have taken 11 years, 21 films but Endgame finally has shown redemption and smart direction from Joe Russo and Anthony Russo[換行字元][換行字元]I want more!"
3660,"There is no other way that an amazing journey like Avengers could've wrapped up. The fire started with Iron Man in 2008 with some marvelous people including the one and only Robert Downey Jr. and director Jon Favreau and ended with the epic piece directed by the Russo Brothers. As Tony Stark quoted, :""part of the journey ended"" and left a legacy to being remembered by so many generations. The movie is definitely a masterpiece of this era which puts us on emotional rollercoaster, enjoy a flashback of the memory lane and a lot of kick-ass stunts. It tattooed our head and heart so deeply that we can never move on from this brilliant piece of jewel. One can only hope that marvel will lit the beacon again in the coming years to sustain this honorable legacy. My advice to all the people, Go watch it, even if you are not a fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe or ""superhero"" movies, you would find it once in a million worthy for spending your money and time both."
3661,"This isn't a simple movie. This is a religious experience. Utter perfection! It can't even be compared to other Marvel movies. This is so much better. Every plot hole that may have been in earlier movies is now neatly zipped up and fixed.[換行字元][換行字元](perhaps some characters could have had some more screen time, but there will be time for that in later movies)"
3662,"Part 2 following on from Part 1 Infinity Wars - how can the universe be saved? This keeps you going to see how it will end. However, it is over long. Again it has suffered from having too many characters in it. Some just did not have to be in the movie at all.[換行字元][換行字元]I still enjoyed the movie, good special effects, some character development that raises an eyebrow or two. Good evil guy (I must have been tired because by the end of it I thought he was starting to make a lot of sense).[換行字元][換行字元]A lot of people have said it's boring, but I wasn't particularly bored. I liked the focus on Jeremy Renner's character and plight, in fact they could have focused more on his character (particularily on earth and his own clean up operation - which would have created more interesting questions versus Thanos' agenda), cut three or four other characters completely (Thor for example), cut the ""silly comedy"" elements by 2/3rds and you'd have had a darker movie I would have loved.[換行字元][換行字元]By the end, you are just glad you've gotten to the end credits. I doubt it will be worth a second viewing."
3663,"When I went into the theatre to see this movie, perhaps my expectations were too high? But after the fantastic ""Infinity Wars"", who would blame me?[換行字元][換行字元]Most of the scenes in the movie felt like they were there just so the director could make a mark on his clipboard where they had every cliche and emotional event possible listed. And a scene at the end contradicts everything we are being told earlier in the movie, not to mention how illogical it is even after superhero movie standard. Yes, I know. I shouldn't be looking for logic and realism in these kinds of movies. But this one scene was so bad it couldn't be unseen. Not when the MCU has delivered so many great movies up to this point.[換行字元][換行字元]For me, this ""Final"" felt a bit cheap. Like they tried to push to much content into on 3 hours movie instead of making two more movies. It's not a terrible movie, but at least for me, not a worthy ""Final"". I watched ""Infinity Wars"" twice in a row because it was that good. I won't do the same with ""Endgame""."
3664,"Though it doesn't contain as many actions as Infinity War, it does have strong stories and perfection. This longest duration of Marvel's movie doesn't really feel that long, it flows in so great sequences, so emotionally. It's an epic closing of the assembled Avengers."
3665,"When Infinity War ended... I was desperate to find out what happens next. After a long year of waiting, Endgame is finally out for the whole world to experience. I can honestly say from start to finish it was a fantastic thrill ride, you could tell the whole cinema audience was Morphed into the Marvel Universe from the get go.[換行字元][換行字元]I would highly recommend watching this film while it is out in cinema.. Why you still reading this.. go and book a ticket, enjoy!"
3666,"One of the best avengers movies ever, with Thanos and all this is what all the movies have been leading to and the finale is great! The visuals are on another level. Some sad disappointing moments but that's how the story goes. You need to watch this absolutely if you are a Marvel or superhero fan!"
3667,"Avenged Endgame serves as a super nice popcorn movie. But the building-up for the final battle happens way too slow, way too dull. The battle itself is epic but ends too soon in my opinion. Some of the punchlines in the film seem too contrived and almost bored me into tears. The movie tries to dig in all the main characters but fails to convey the depth. With that said, the visual and sound effects do deserve being appreciated in an IMAX movie theater."
3668,Part 1 of the 2 final movies was perfect. Character development was still going forward. Endgame is nothing but a screen full of the characters we have come to know and love. It tried to tell too much so what we ended up with was clips and a lot of jumping around. It was like a movie made up of movie preview clips. What a let down after all these years.
3669,"Never seen such a pathetic movie, they didn't meet my expect ions, it has no comparison with Infinity War. The whole plot lack to build a sequence."
3670,The Ending has to be one of the few good endings I have witnessed in a movie ever!
3671,"We've spent 11 years waiting for this peak 3 hours. Thank you Marvel. It was the most ""everything"" I've ever seen."
3672,"More than 2 hours of drama and only minutes of action...or at least that's what it felt like. Also, tons of that annoying Hollywood epic type of music to make me consider muting it."
3673,"Hands down the greatest comic-book movie I've ever watched, and honestly one of my favorite blockbusters of all time. It was b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l."
3674,A big disappointment for Thor fans. Intentionally made him dummy and useless. No other Avenger has such a great screen presence than Thor and this was intentionally ruined in the movie. Was expecting till the end for Thor to come back in this movie. It was totally stupid to make Thor like this.
3675,Ya. Very nice. I like. I will give this movie 10 Ferraris out of 10 Ferraris.
3676,THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE OR BETTER THE BEST MOVIE EVER.I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT AGAIN
3677,"The Avengers Endgame is an experience you don't want to miss. The CGI effects was over the top and such a spectacle to behold. I couldn't miss a second of it. Hold your bladder or manage restroom breaks accordingly. After this epic 3 hour experience I could only give this movie a solid 8. Spite the fun and graphics there was too much sexist moments that I could not help but wonder...why? It should focus everyone together as a team. The humor took a step too far and really destroyed 2 major characters because of this direction. Besides that, this movie is a must see. Have a good time."
3678,"Avengers: Endgame is an abundantly gratifying finale that rewards long-lasting loyalty to the series. Endgame is visually magnificent, it looks stunning with phenomenal scale and is executed exquisitely. Emotionally invested, we feel grief, pain & struggle. This movie belongs to the originals. Tony, Steve, Bruce, Natasha, Thor and Clint. This is their story. A movie that will last for a very long time. I love you 3000."
3679,"Really disappointed with this as a finale. Plodding, boring story development with time-wasting scenes that should have never survived the editing room final cuts. Underutilization of significant characters and over-utilization of lesser characters. Seemed poorly thought through on many levels & was tiring having to sit through everything. Expected so much more. Will be the only MU film that I will never watch again."
3680,"Avengers: Endgame (5 out of 5 stars).[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers: Endgame is a magnificent awesome superhero film that concludes the infinity stones storyline that has been building up with 22 movies in the Marvel universe. They had done a great job building up each solo character and have there films bring something new and exciting. Endgame is the game changer that delivers the ultimate climax of the story arc with the big bad Thanos (Josh Brolin) going up against the Avengers. After the previous film Infinity War leaving the audience hanging with the cliffhanger. Marvel has done a great job in marketing and keeping this film spoilers free with the trailers that only show the same footage and very minimum. Which I will say it is best to see the film knowing very little about what is going to happen.[換行字元][換行字元]I will try to keep this review spoiler free. Endgame is amazing and spectacular. Joe and Anthony Russo direction was fantastic and they did a great job in delivering a spectacular climax of the MCU. The plot was amazing. For a three hour long film. The film does move pretty fast and kind of feels short when watching it. I did feel like Endgame is a little short on the action set pieces like the previous films. Which this film does focus more on the emotional connections with the original Avengers like Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and how they were all affected by the aftermath of Infinity War. The film does have a lot of fun and feels like a wild adventure with what these characters go through. The final hour delivers all out with an epic climax which every character has a moment to shine. And makes up for the lack of action in the movie. I love how every hero works with another when fighting there enemy. There were some moments where you will be in an awe and clapping moment with the climatic battle sequence. The visual effects are top notch great. There is some fun humor that will lighten the mood of the film. And there are some tear jerking moments that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. The directors did a wonderful job in surprising the audience with something new and reaching every characters full potential. The climatic fight scene with Thor, Cap America, and Iron Man teaming up and bouncing around with there super powers are just awesome. The surprises do keep on coming throughout. Which will leave you feeling satisfied.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a great and awesome superhero film. It is one of the best finales that Joe and Anthony Russo have delivered. The plot was amazing and fast moving. The direction focuses more on the emotional side of the characters and story. While delivering an epic climatic showdown that will have you grasping and excited. The cast ensemble was great. I will say this is one fun wild ride that I am happy how it ties the story arc together."
3681,"This movie was meant to be watched in an IMAX theater, especially because the sound makes up a very important part of the movie. To be honest, there were times when I felt that this movie is definitely 3 hours, but I can see why it was so necessary. This movie truly delivers what it promises it would! This movie really marks an important era in cinema."
3682,A perfect blend of all Marvel super Heroes in One movie ....Thats the Avengers End Game
3683,"Everything was perfect in this movie, the reunion scenes, the integration scenes,t he fight scenes,although there was a plot hole regarding time travel but it can be negotiated when you are watching a movie like this."
3684,"Just have to say, if you haven't seen this movie and are a Mcu fan, don't waste any time and go see this marvellous spectacle. You won't regret it. Btw carry handkerchief or tissue to see this movie. You will love marvel 3000 after seeing this movie."
3685,"Movie is full of action, but even for that I wait last 30 min when the movie Will be over, cause it didn't have hype to keep me exciting. Characters are great written. Some Characters as Thor and Hulk are much different that we been seen them before. Fight scenes and acting are better in Infinity war.For example:when Thor come in Wakanda in Infinity war. Story line is great, but have some gaps. In this movie Cap. American and Iron man are in front plan. In this movie Thor is so so different and almost act like a girl. This is to big turn over for such musculine and strongest character of all Avengers.on moment it looks like this is Cap America or Iron man movie. I expect much more after media advertising."
3686,"One of the best movies I have ever watched ... ""Avengers : Endgame"" is the best Ending of 10 years of The MCU .. the movie was dramatic not just a superhero movie which the heros win at the end, No the movie has drama and the acting was too good from all the characters .. That's why I liked so much, It Isn't like any superhero film, It Was Epic !"
3687,"The half part is boring, and its not really fun to see so many super hero, not a really good inspiring story or no story at all. Glad it finally ends."
3688,"This is easily not only the best Marvel movie ever, it is the BEST movie ever. A true fan will have tears by the end of the movie. No movie compares to the emotional connection this one has to offer. Along with emotions, laughter is another that you will find amazing. Its a complete package of superheroes, emotions action. Must see and hands down this movie deserves 10/10."
3689,I can't lie it was one of the best movies i have seen.
3690,"Endgame is the biggest of all, there is all there, history, action, comedy, mystery and tears in the End not forgetting the signature (a not answered question).[換行字元][換行字元]Thank You for this!!!"
3691,This movie is extraordinary. The Russo brothers have nailed it. The endgame of the 10 years of journey was really worth watching. If you didn't watch it in theatre please do go and see the movie. And of course don't download it. It is one in a million movie.
3692,"It was a great movie. The action,comedy,acting was amazing.Hats off to the direction,the story. The actor done a really amazing job.Full of fun. So amazing ."
3693,"Just got back from a matinee of ""Avengers: Endgame""(2019). In short, a spectacular, satisfying and enjoyable finale to the Marvel Universe movie series. They hit so many ""right"" notes and gave the characters their respect and moments and manage to fit in so much material coherently in one movie. Without giving anything away, the final scene is just so right and the whipped cream and sprinkles on the sundae. My only real gripe? (drum roll), some of the action. That hyper-shot, dizzying camera moves and hyper editing style that I've come to despise in the last 20 years. A big screen Xbox game with a 6 year old at the control, who has ADD! I think some of the action in other Marvel Universe movies was shot and edited better. Having said that, this entry is right at the top of the summit of the super hero genre and should make a quadrillion dollars at the box office."
3694,Hands down one of the best films I've seen. The end game was epic. See this movie!
3695,"What it needs to be a hero? Power? No. Sacrifice? Yes. It's not the end. There will always be a fight worth fighting for. There will always be a dream to avenge. Never ever give up. Do whatever it takes. And be a hero. Thank you MCU for giving us 10 years of lovely memories. To teach us about love, friendship and determination. It was a wonderful experience, thank you again."
3696,"Endgame is, in my opinion, certainly overrated. That's not to say I didn't like it, it's just not nearly as good as many people make it out to be. My eleven year old son loved it, but I expected more. Maybe my expectations were too high, I'll admit that. After all, it's an action movie with little substance at its core. It's wrapped in all the bells and whistles and quite often delivers an adequately exciting ride, but unfortunately it's just a bit of a mess. The bits that are meant to be heartfelt fell flat for me, riddled with improbable scenarios. Not the type of scenarios that involve godlike aliens wielding ultra powerful rocks, those are to be expected in this type of movie. The scenarios I'm referencing as improbable are the poorly derived emotional moments that just seem to have no structure and lack consistency, detracting from the effectiveness of the characters. Overall Endgame is a worthwhile watch, but not a worthy final stanza. It fell short of being the finale it could have been due to a messy plot and melodramatic tendencies."
3697,"This is the perfect ending to a generation of Marvel Movies! I'll have to rewatch, not only this many more times, but all movies, just to digest it all. Thank you Stan"
3698,"An absolute triumphant ending to The Infinity War Saga. Superbly Directed, a real rollercoaster of emotions. Nuff Said!!!"
3699,Literal chills all the time and a lot of crying. Like a lot of crying
3700,"Awesome thriller and drama,with comedy,sadness. I watch it three times and will buy on blue ray disc. I can't wait for more story continues on phrase 4."
3701,"I never did side with either DC or Marvel - even as a kid in the 1960's. There were superheroes I liked and ignored the rest. Now, while DC is showing us how poorly a film can be made (particularly ""Justice League""), Marvel has aced 60% of their 22 films to date in my opinion. I wish that was the case with this one. It not only underwhelmed me, it didn't serve it's predecessor well.[換行字元][換行字元]I certainly don't fault the cast because outside the handful of main characters, the rest were merely background and foreground. After Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow, the rest of the cast were so many that they seemed like they were there for scenery. And like ""Justice League"", ""Avengers: Endgame"" suffered from the ""more is more"" syndrome that may please the under-10 crowd, but takes meaning away for us older viewers.[換行字元][換行字元]Let's not overlook the cop-out remedy in science fiction these days - the reliance upon time travel to get out of a script jam. I realize it was a necessity in this particular chain of fictional events, but after a while it seems like (pardon the musical reference) a long, drawn-out guitar solo that has you wishing the band would get back to the song.[換行字元][換行字元]This review isn't due to Thor (my favorite Marvel hero) growing fat and channeling his inner surfer dude, Tony Stark losing his life or Gamora 2.0 being the anti-Gamora. My regret is FOR the franchise instead of me as a viewer. They ended on a sad technical note due to unnecessary goings-on that I'm sure they worked very hard at trying to tie up in a movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Another point that detracted from this film, and a few others in the Marvel cinematic universe is their social messaging. They didn't need to preach woman power because superheroes already have that built into their character. Here, it's shoved into our faces to signal their fashionable virtuosity. In other words, if there is a female superhero in a film, I don't need to be reminded that there's a sexual revolution going on here in reality. Theirs are formidable personas without need to be underscored.[換行字元][換行字元]Using another musical analogy, this movie was like the members of Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and The Who taking the stage at the same time and playing their sets. Apart, they're the best. Together, they're just noise. ""Avengers: Endgame"" would have been better if they pared down the scope, although I understand why they went the way they did. A franchise as successful as MCU set itself up for such a debacle. I'm grateful that it wasn't much, much worse.[換行字元][換行字元]I thank those at Marvel for bringing to life the characters I read about in comic books at the corner store. They did a very good job overall."
3702,"The movie was amazing, the whole show came together in such a perfect way. Dying to see what comes next."
3703,"Just couldn't not finish it. Felt like a Kardashian Endgame. glad i didn't pay, it any money. What has happened to marvel movies in general are those positive reviews bots or bought? There were less than 1/3 action. The rest were full drama, for a almost 3 hour movie doesn't seem realistic."
3704,"Captain America, Iron man and the Avengers all should have stopped after their first movie. Antman was terrible whatsoever and only Thor Ragnarok was a better movie than the first in the serie. Endgame is a horrible movie and only rated high since it is the end of a well appreciated line."
3705,"A beautiful and full filling way to end a saga lasted 10 years,"
3706,"A must see, Best movie ever!!!! I really think this is the best super hero movie ever made!!! Thank you Marvel"
3707,"You'll cheer, you'll laugh and you'll cry.[換行字元][換行字元]But most importantly, you will enjoy.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers: Endgame turned out to be more than wished for and delivered all the action, humor and emotions balanced in a perfect manner.[換行字元][換行字元]One must not forget that it's not a standalone film and due to that, the slow pace in the first half can be understood. It will however not bore you for even a second, that's for sure.

If you've been following all MCU movies since Iron Man (2008), there's no way you won't like it.[換行字元][換行字元]It's a great action movie, a great comic book movie, a true crowd-pleaser and possibly the best superhero movie, but first and foremost, it's... it's a...[換行字元][換行字元]I'm speechless."
3708,Couldn't have thought of a better ending for this series. Acting/ story/ CGI on point.
3709,Perfection That is all i can say I love u 3000 Avengers
3710,"The film once again managed to include all emotions, just like infinity war did. At the beginning it was not what I was expecting, and from I've gathered this has caused many people to disregard the whole film, but the fact they tried something different makes it unique. The film still reached a point where the whole tone flipped and this is where it became even better. This is the only film I have been to see that has made the audience applaud, that must show how these films have been able to create such a connection with the MCU community to the characters."
3711,Amazing movie and I am not even into superhero movies that much! Amazing actors and graphics! Definitely should watch.
3712,"In all honesty there is no recollection of any Marvel movie that can and did deliver on the full rollercoaster of emotions. I mean yes there is the strongest of possibilities you will cry in an Avengers movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame I'm sure you don't have to be told is set after Infinity War, infact five years after, we see how the surviving gang have been impacted by the loss of their friends from the actions of Thanos. From there they take us on a journey of how they can fix their wrong. You wont even recognise that three hours have passed as it keeps you fully engaged.[換行字元][換行字元]Without giving too much away you will see how the next adventures may transpire and why there is a Guardians 3 coming. Really if you're a fan of the franchise you're going to see this anyway, so....... There will be no spoilers here (#dontspoilendgame)."
3713,Man this film goes beyond any superhero film or any film that ever made ...hope marvel continues giving us these sorts of films..
3714,"I watched all movies of MCU. And they connected with each other. It's like if i go in past then i remember when i watched IronMan-1 and now it's an end of all these movies. Each and every moment of this film tell something and connect with past MCU movies. I got emotional at the end of film because we will never see our favorite character after endgame. In short, movie was awesome and wonderful. Must watch this movie. Thanks to MCU for this era 2008 - 2019."
3715,After watching this movie I just had to make an account to rate it. Solid 10/10. Words can't describe how good this movie is.
3716,The whole movie was so intense and gave what we all wanted while developing this inspirational universe. An amazing ending for an amazing saga. Thank you Avengers. Thank you Kevin Feige. Thank you Russo Brothers. Thank you Stan Lee.
3717,"What's there to say? The film met or exceeded all of my expectations. Although an inferior sequel to Infinity War, it still is an epic and noteworthy film. It's a must watch!"
3718,"I just watched Endgames, three hours are over; Tired, completely dehydrated after crying so much. And we instinctively held each other in hand at some point along the way, with my side fields"
3719,"Being a marvel fan I was very excited to watch it. This turned out to be little disappointing. Still enjoyable, but I think "" infinity war"" was way way good."
3720,"He is without doubt the baddest villain we've seen, the power of the man and this is even without the infinity stones, he damn near Physically beat nearly everyone to death! He's scenes made sense with the cut scenes we've seen in earlier films.[換行字元][換行字元]I liked this movie lots, there are some slow bit that drag on but I would say the last 50 minutes is on smoke!

3721,All i can say is that i wished GOT 'the long night' episode was this good...
3722,"My review of Avengers Endgame:[換行字元][換行字元]The best MCU movie. The theatre went totally nuts. It had spectacular action. it was surprisingly funny, and emotionally captivating. It manages a large roster of well developed characters very well executed, everyone gets a moment to shine. Delightful throwbacks to previous outings as well as smartly placed pop culture references. A truly satisfying finale for the 22movie and 10 year story arc which we have loved."
3723,"The last half an hour had me on a mega emotional rollercoaster. I'm blown away, so speechless. I can't remember the last time I got goosebumps all over my body. Holy. Crap. It's INSANE! Cannot fault a single second of the film, it was perfect."
3724,The only complaint about Avengers: Endgame is that it raises the bar so high that there may well never be a superhero movie to match it.
3725,Never thought that a superhero movie could make me as emotional as this one did. RDJ's turn as IronMan was brilliant. To see the character develop from the first IronMan movie to this iteration was a journey well worth taking. And to have the story wrap up with all the characters and plot lines coming together was mind-blowing. A modern classic that sucks you in from the word go.
3726,"Marvel Studios' Avengers:Endgame,was the best movie I have ever seen in my whole life.I hope that in the future the Russo brothers will continue doing a great job,just like Endgame and Infinity War.Trust me,if you go and see that movie,you aren't going to be disappointed.When you get out of the theatre,you are gonna fell like hugging Marvel Studios for that amazing effort on that movie.We're in the Endgame now!"
3727,"Pros: top notch cinematic, over the top action, nice concept of time travel.[換行字元][換行字元]Cons: chaotic scenes with so many characters, forced cringe moments."
3728,"It was a marvels fans dream. Loved it all the way. The perfect end to all the fans, giving moments of full action. Avengers: Endgame shows an incredible connection between all the movies of this amazing universe developed among eleven years. Yes it slows down a bit. But over all a visual treat I must say."
3729,"Watching the coming attractions was depressing. No wonder kids are half brain-dead today. My only interest in anything Avengers is Benedict Cumberbatch. I thought this was a fun film, loved all the cameos and the actors are all very likable. Special effects were amazing, but for about a half hour there I felt like I was watching a video game.[換行字元][換行字元]Thought the script managed to have some poignancy and humor as well. And you have to see it in a theater."
3730,"I had high expectations for this movie and was not disappointed. This movie provides an unprecedented full circle resolution for a cinematic series of this genre...some would even call this movie a cultural phenomenon. Personally, I would say this movie was extremely enjoyable and an emotional rollercoaster. I would advise watching this movie and appreciating it for what it is: a solid conclusion to an excellent series, instead of nitpicking it's flaws and overthinking the actions taking place."
3731,"I loved Infinity, I even gave it 10/10 and watched it 3 times. Infinity was a masterpiece; it was creative with a lot of actions and a good story. I even wanted to see more of Infinity when it ended,... but Endgame was a joke that was not even funny.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame was a disappointment, boring, jokes were meant more for like little kids (I didn't even smile), barely any action, and at the end... it turned into a soap opera. It was like a mess, and it felt kind of rushed because it looked as if they ran out of ideas. It was so boring that I kept looking at my watch wanting the movie to end already. I didn't expect this part 2 after seeing part 1. Giving 5/10, I think that's even too high because I was bored and disappointed as hell."
3732,"This film stays with you even after you leave the theatre ! The best conclusion to the epic saga,hats off to the Russo brothers !"
3733,Overall great from story to humour definitely deserves a 10/10. very unexpected ending but enjoyed by everyone
3734,"Avengers: Endgame tries to do it all, but falls flat if you're not a die hard MCU Fan who obsesses about all the characters and details. While Infinite War upped the ante and delivered, Endgame in comparison has too much not very intriguing character mediations instead of development. And it isn't much help that the final scene plays out similiar to Infinity War. While it is an enjoyable movie and a fitting end to the Saga of the Infinity Stones, it's much more exciting to think about what might lie ahead in the MCU."
3735,"The Russo brothers really did an amazing job at going full circle with this movie and paying respect to the previous Marvel movies. You will laugh, cry and repeat."
3736,"The film is good except for a few glitch in timeline and plots. But it has so much political correctness such that it seems pretentious. So we are having a black iron man, a black captain us, a black female Thor; the rest become unimportant; and of course hawkeye has to kill Japanese to release his anger. I am expecting a black spider woman and a female 'doctor right'. Please give them to me OK Marvel? Please?"
3737,"Cheap trick my Disney to try and overtake Avatar! I am furious the Disney said that there will be a few surprises and some deleted scenes (plural). I was honestly expecting to see them within the movie or some extra dialogue, but nothing. The 1 scene AFTER the credits was not even noteworthy and had not even been finished. Complete let down. The original had no end credit scene, but this one did, and with just a few hours away from spiderman, it was not worth showing, it should have been shared at the end of the original cut like with all the other marvel films. I saw the original on the opening night and a few times after and scored the film 8 out of 10. But this score of 5 is because the re-release left a bitter taste from a money grabbing Disney."
3738,"I won't add any spoilers. It was a great marvel movie, but not one of my favorites. They had so much information to try and wrap into three hours, that they just left gapping plot holes. 2nd half of the movie rocked, but still massive plot holes."
3739,"Undoubtedly the best movie in marvel history. The perfect conclusion for one of the most epic sagas ever written. I've seen it at day one and i'm willing to see it a thousand times more. Thank you for this 10 years of dedication and hard work marvel, you've been incredible."
3740,"Spectacular, Emotional, Joyful, Unexpected, Filled with Actions.. Avengers Endgame is lifetime achievement.. It's the conclusion of 22 films.. It's like end of an era.. So please watch it in Imax or 3D and don't spoil the movie.. You'll enjoy it very much.. The ending is very satisfying.."
3741,"When Infinity War ended last year I said to myself that there was no way the next Avengers film could ever surpass its greatness. Well, simply put I was wrong. Endgame brought the goosebumps caused by the rollercoaster of overwhelming emotions that enveloped the entire audience. Or maybe just me for I was clapping and cheering while the whole cinema remained reserved in its reactions. But anyways the film through its 3 hour runtime brought anticipation, excitement, and a rush of adrenaline through my veins. Every scene has this certain feel that makes you think that you're in the same mess as the main characters are. That aspect gave each scene a certain tension, that of which other films lack. A constant feel of danger so to speak but that also gives you the opportunity to laugh and... well like I said its a plethora of emotions really. I don't want to get in detail about everything in the film but wow, this is history and we get to tell our grandkids how it was to see it firsthand. Simply astonishing 10/10 I am at lost for words really."
3742,"Perfect ending. Every moment in this movies was mind blowing. It had a lot of action, comedy and drama. Words can't give this movie justice. I had hyped up this movie in my head for a long time but it was so much better than I thought it could be. A must see!"
3743,No spoilers and most epic movie ever. Go to bathroom before movie and sit back and enjoy. The writing the acting and cinematography was excellent. Normally don't do reviews but as an avid movie watcher from F movies to Oscar ones this is one of the best movies and endings to a series of films ever. AMAZING AND WILL SEE AGAIN!
3744,"Waited for the endgame ever since I left the theatre after infinity war. I really wanted to enjoy the movie, I even cheered for all the cliche stuff that was shoved in the film as what you would call fan service. But what the writers did to the fans was really disrespectfull. They wrote off all the heroes whose contract is done with marvel in the most rediculous way possible. Oh make hulk all green , sacrifice black widow for no reason, make captain America old, uselessly old, and please don't get me started on the unnecessary killing of Iron man the God father of the what so called Marvel Cinematic universe. They wanted us to give up Our old heroes to make way for their new ones, but just because we are fan they can manipulate us the way they want, but just because we are fans this is the one thing we won't do. It's not easy for a fan to let go of his hero and move on. We deserve a better end than that, their heroes deserve a better end than that insult. For heaven sake even Loki deserve a better ending than that. As a fan I was ready to allow all the none sense the story had, but insult me and take away my favorite hero and I will eat you alive. I will allow the whole concept of time travel thing, but let's go through the logic they had to fix everything. They would go back in time and steal the stones from different timelines bring them to the future snap their fingers bring everyone back, okay after that it gets stupid they will return the stones back right when they took them, wait won't that be putting the stones for Thanos to take again in his own timeline to snap his fingers and repeat the loss AGAIN. Why wouldn't they just go to the past destroy one of the stones once and for all. That would have at least saved black widow. Why would iron man snap his fingers why didn't he use the power of the stones and kicked Thanos ass at least that would have given us the satisfaction of revenge. How did Thanos get all the pym particles to get almost all his planet on earth through time travel in quantum realm when the avengers themselves had only enough for ONE ROUND TRIP. Where did the Asgardians come from. Didn't Thanos destroy their whole ship in the start of infinity war. How did the valkirey get her white horse for heaven sake have some respect for our heads and what good did the flying horse do really Nothing. Why make Thor this miserable and useless, that's not fair to his fans at least, why give him 5 minutes chat with his mother when it does nothing to his morals or affect the story at all. Same for the starks father son meeting absolutely meaningless. Where was Thor and iron man when Thanos beat the hell out of captain America, sleeping ?!! The end fight scene was terrible in the least. Single fight no unity at all even though they were all there and what became of Thanos they did better fighting him when he had the stones now that he is without them he becomes invincible why?!! Just to kill away Iron man?!! And don't get me started on the boring out of context gay conversation captain America has with an unknown and why he gives his shield to falcon just because he is black, leaving Baky his almost brother behind. The girl power scene was crab and too imposed. Spider man comes back after 5 years to find his friends still at high school ?!!! You ruined it all Marvel ,you destroyed my 11 years of entertainment with a really horrible ending that just serves you and not the dedicated fans whom made this possible for you. That is a promise from me and I believe from many other fans WE WON'T BE SUCKED UP IN YOUR WORLD OR UNIVERSE OR WHATEVER AGAIN. THAT IS IT. FIND NEW FANS."
3745,I didn't think they could pull it off after the epic that was infinity war but somehow they did and it's an amazing movie with a great conclusion to first 10 years of marvel cinematic universe.
3746,"Very good film i really enjoyed it it was cool loads of action obviously and both funny and quite sad , the only problem i have is did it really need to be 3 hours long .....?"
3747,Wow wow wow what a emotional rollercoaster of a movie. Oscar material if I ever so one.
3748,"It's too slow and there's lack of action in the movie, I think they focused more on story line and all , but it's a good movie."
3749,"This has to be the best movie of all times. I watched it with my friend and We enjoyed the movie so much. There was hype we were jumping and screaming and cheering. The storyline is perfect the acting is outstanding the direction and cinematography script everything is perfect. Respect to all those who work hard on this movie. No doubt the best movie of all time. We already watched the movie 3 times now. Some people move on but not us we going to watch it tongiht again. Whatever it takes, Whatever it takes."
3750,A wonderful experience. A journey worth remember and watched. And also part of a journey is end but an epic end.
3751,Early reviews suggest that the movie will be a big hit.
3752,Incredible movie!!! All around amazing!!! A beautiful ending that felt not only like a proper wrap up to everything we have seen in the MCU so far but also opened so many doors for the future. BEST MCU MOVIE!
3753,It's an ok movie but do not go in believing all the hype and expecting a perfect movie... if so you will probably be disappointed...they should have cut it down about an hour and it would have been much better
3754,"What a way to end this phase of Marvel. Comedy, Action, Drama, Romance, and Sadness all rolled into a single movie. Great job marvel."
3755,"I've seen this 3 times now, and it's such a gift. As a lifelong comic book and movie nerd, I couldn't have asked for much more. Epic. Touching. So exciting."
3756,"The movie wasn't that we wished and waited for it, because we thought we will see balance of action and story telling, also we were so hyped for seeing new villin on the movie, in first hr of the film, the dramma went prefectly, but in last hr, was so fast and the final battle was so short, in the end the film Is not what we I expected"
3757,"Easy shots by skilled players make this a fairly disappointing finale to arguably one of the most depressing set-ups in action film history.[換行字元][換行字元]While not fully predictable, there certainly aren't any surprises. Plot points were easily filed under ""sure. Why not.""[換行字元][換行字元]Heavy handed, almost disingenuous, with it's moral platitudes; the film couldn't muster any real investment in it's characters' developments. It had to rely on cheap TV drama level sentimentality. Requisite emasculation and patronizing feminism negated each other. It basically felt like the producers just don't know any, or even worse, like any actual humans.[換行字元][換行字元]Oh. Pacing was tortuous. You're going to see it anyway, though. So have fun.[換行字元][換行字元]Bonus points for ID-ing the purposeful use of satanic imagery at the end of the movie. Why. Just why.....?"
3758,"It was a very good movie. It was not a marvel movie, it was A MOVIE with a Marvel background. I was tens.. it has action, it has joy, good script , awesome actors."
3759,"Some people compare the Avengers series with the Star Wars series and the Lord of the Rings series. I don't know where the comparison is. Not to mention that the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings are of the movie history level, at least in one sense, none of the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings series is a single movie about a single character. Their films have many characters, but what they produce can be called epics. Films like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are enduring classics and will be model textbooks for many years to come. So which Marvel movie is worthy of the word ""classic""? Over the past 11 years, I have followed the footsteps of Superhero movie. I have seen all the Marvel movies shown in the cinema. I can only say that I am worthy of myself. But if one only talks about feelings when evaluating a movie, what are the other values of this movie?"
3760,"Where to begin? All the callbacks and tie-ins to past MCU films are truly a celebration of the MCU. As always, the action is exciting(Although sparse) and humour cracks you up. This movie reaches a new level going into the third act, with epic moments that put a grin on your face and an ending that might just put a tear in your eye. A must watch!"
3761,The Best Movie of 2019 (so far!) It was full of twists!
3762,"Marvel fan for years now and I am disappointed about Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers 2 is much better, full of action with multiple scenes, full cover for each single hero"
3763,Marvel gave us the best end to the infinty war now in end:game i could not say its the best movie no it is the most interesting or amazing movie of marvel I've ever seen sorry avatar avengers wins[換行字元][換行字元]What ever it takes
3764,"There is a lot more right with this movie then wrong. Marvel fans will love it. It is too long by about 35 minutes and focuses mostly on the original six Avengers (who after 20 Marvel films are no longer the most exciting of the line up). The battle scenes are amazing but also happen so fast it will all be a blur. (It's meant to be watched more then a few times.) The plot is confusing and Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) is barely in it. (A big over sight as her film was a major box office hit.) Unless you are a fan (and who isn't) you'll want to take a hard pass on this one. Do not watch it in 3D!! The glasses just darken an already gloomy screen image. Not worth it. Otherwise, it's a fun popcorn movie with enough emotional highs and lows to merit the hype surrounding it. Might be best to see it in IMAX or at the drive in."
3765,"This is an emotional roller coaster that honors in a superb way the last 10 years of Marvel movies. It's a perfect conclusion to an era. It's 3 hours long but it feels like 1. It all happens so fast. I was on the verge of tears like 5 or 6 times. The dilemma Tony faces throughout the movie is very well executed. The characters, although many, have enough things to do during the movie. It's non-stop action and it never gets slow. The script has, naturally, the advantage of dealing with characters (and a situation) we already know and love, and that are well defined, but creates something new with it all. It's been an incredible journey. And a part of the journey, is the end."
3766,"This is an absolute joy. 3 hours of escapism to a world you know and love. Humour, sadness and action in perfect balance."
3767,Just an amazing movie 5 seconds.. I was really impressed even after the film was finished
3768,"This movie is clearly not for everyone, there are divided fan bases because of the dramatic tonal shift from infinity war people must realise infinity war was its own movie. Endgame is the conclusion of 10 years worth of Marvel films that truly delivers the best way possible. Towards the end of the film during the final climax I saw what Marvel really was, more so than infinity war and what it will become into the future. This movie is truly remarkable for what it is as well as the woven tapastry and carefully woven gems and character arcs that conclude part one of many to come MCU!"
3769,"Last time while watching Infinity Wars, I was left devastated but still there was a hope that something will happen and we will be saved from trauma that Infinity wars gave me. Endgame is different. It leaves you devastated as well as ameliorated. At one moment you are cheering, the next moment you are full of sorrow. At the end, you have mixed feelings. You want to laugh with joy but you want to cry too."
3770,"End game is a culmination of over a decade of films and Marvel pulled it off better than any production company before them. The full cast were all second to none, the script was very well thought out and the action gave us all if not most, exactly why we had hoped for. There are sad moments, funny lines, dramatic build ups and the to trained eye, a closure to a lot of stories spanning from many fans would have even been born. Personally I've watched the film 6 times now and love it every time."
3771,Captain marvel is overpowered and in all honesty was not needed in the film. I feel that the screen time given to capt marvel should've been given to Adam warlock. The film was extraordinary and definitely will be buying a blu-ray copy to complete my collection. 10/10 rating
3772,"Watching this was so surreal. It was unlike anything the MCU has ever seen, and I mean that in a good way. If there was an option to rate this higher I would"
3773,This was a good movie. Loved it!!!! Loved the ending too!!!!!!
3774,"OMG... This movie is more than you could have imagined.It has everything what you can expect from a MARVEL movie but still it is more than that.It has Action,drama,comedy,emotion...you name it. I don't have any word to describe the feeling. Russo brothers created something which no one could have created. And kudos to the writers also who knew exactly what people want from this. Overall this is the best MARVEL movie ever and trust me you will laugh so much and cry so much. Be prepare to have an awesome experience and shout as much as you can. Maybe you will never get chance to shout this much."
3775,"It is made with great CG and it does not make me bored even though it runs for three hours. However, it is better to watch all of marvel films. I did not do it so I could not get some point."
3776,"In arguably the most anticipated movie of the year and one of the most anticipated movies of all time, Avengers: Endgame was well on its way with all the hype leading up to the film. Having enjoyed Infinity War but thought it could have been better all around, the overall hype for Endgame had its match made. Now having watching this film in theaters as it was a must watch to (due to the 3D experience and also knowing the longer one waited, the more likely spoilers would have been exposed, ruining the experience and essence of the film).[換行字元][換行字元]As a film, won't say much but this film delivers on expectations. Had no knowledge of the overall plot but within the first few minutes, one was excited and was there for the thrill of the ride throughout. With a runtime of over three hours (including end credits), the film has a great pace and doesn't feel nearly as long (which is great since something is always happening). Due to its great cast and plethora of characters, there really is never a dull moments and the film is ensured and filled with moments of surprise, suspense, action emotion and overall greatness.[換行字元][換行字元]Now the overall plot of time travel was well done and brought back many memories to the other Avenger films. The wait for the film was most definitely worth it, and this film will most doubly become one of the biggest movies of alltime. Will need to see this film probably once more in theaters before its run is over and most definitely will see it again multiple times afterwards to soak in its greatness. Avengers: Endgame is more than a movie, it's a moment - a moment in time. Cherish every moment."
3777,"To start this off, I am an avid fan of the Marvel movies. I have been seeing every one in theater since Iron Man. Of course I was excited for this film, considering it was the final film, and I saw it opening night. To be simple, I was very disappointed. The main issue with this film is the length. The first two hours of the film are boring and have a plot that no one really cares about. The last hour is great and full of nice action sequences, but by this point, the last hour could not redeem it. A weak and sloppy story is the main problem with this film. Is it worth watching? Of course, but do not expect too much. Avengers Endgame is an okay film, but certainly is not as spectacular as it should have been. Marvel ends their wonderful 10 years of film with a sloppy, yet somewhat entertaining film."
3778,"Starting many years agoe this saga began, on a journey of true extraordinary characters and storylines. Not all of them were great but they all held a beautiful story to a bigger story.[換行字元][換行字元]I can go on writing on all the wonderful and lovely parts of the film and maybe pick a bad place e here 'n there but it's not needed. This is a genuine and beautiful story on people we've had the joy of following for a decade. This is an emotional roller coaster that will brace every part of the viewer. If you're in this hero-worls then you owe it to the industry to see this movie. I did, I cried and I recommend you to see it as well, it's goddam amazing![換行字元][換行字元]Thanks for everything Stan. With love, Rob."
3779,"I was so excited to see this movie. 1.5 hours later I walked out from sheer boredom. First movie I have ever walked out of. If it was a normal length feature, I would have suffered through the whole thing, but knowing I have another 1.5 hours to go made me want to cry in misery. I left my husband and ran errands ... THAT is how boring it was.[換行字元][換行字元]Boredom aside, there were so many eye rolling moments that left me surprised with the praise this movie received. AND if you have ever studied physics and the theories of time travel ... I'd suggest you do yourself a favor and leave this for the flat earthers."
3780,It was by far the most emotional movie of the series. It can only be rated as an absolut10 by the reactions of the viewers in the cinema hall.
3781,I liked it alot. Fantastic performance and work from all the management and performers
3782,"Avengers Endgame truly created a new milestone. Including fun, tears, legends and anything out of your mind, Endgame is the best Marvel Studios Movies."
3783,Worth watching.. an emotional journey with lots of memories.. marvel's best movie ever..
3784,"This movie is amazing. It's emotional, it's funny, it's intense. It's everything you want from a movie ending a decade old story arc. The movie is beautiful, the story is engaging, the acting is on point. The humor is exactly when needed and never too much. The fight scene... that was something else. The ending feels like a true ending and it's a treat to watch. This is the comic book movie to beat and I loved every second of it. 10/10"
3785,"It is the hardwork of marvel for more than 10 year which is result in form of this movie. This movie is full of action, comedy, emotional and many more."
3786,"11 years, 22 movies, countless characters that brought something to our lives for the past decade that nothing else has. its not just a movie, its an experience, an emotional roller coaster, an epic saga. it was made for us, not the critics, not the oscars, for us, the fans of any age who waited and bought every movie ticket with excitement. if you are this fan, this will be nothing less of a masterpiece. words can not describe my gratitude and of millions of others for this amazing achievement. thank you Marvel, every director and every actor big or small that brought this to life on the big screen, and most importantly the great Stan Lee."
3787,"After 11 years and 22 films, the Infinity Saga finally concludes with Avengers: Endgame. It's truly an experience to watch this in cinema, for the creativity, the emotional impact, surprises, and the fun this film brings. Despite the 182 minute run time, it is excellently paced and rarely has a feeling of dragging out for too long.[換行字元][換行字元]However, I only recommend this film to those individuals who have watched most if not all of the films prior to Avengers: Endgame in the Infinity Saga. A causal moviegoer may or may not enjoy it, but someone who has followed the saga from the very beginning will most likely appreciate this film for it is the finale after all."
3788,This is the Best movie ive ever seen. You need to watch it!!!!!!
3789,I am speechless after watching this movie. Still having problem processing my thoughts after watching this movie. Some big changes were made and it will be very unacceptable to many hardcore MCU fans but everything must come to an end. The best ending to a decade of movie journey and end to an epic saga. Kudos to Russo brothers for gifting viewers this epic conclusion.
3790,"IW was way better, this movie did not deliver, I actually even preferred Capt Marvel."
3791,"It feels like an eternity since the bald, purple alien madman Thanos (Josh Brolin) assembled his impressive gauntlet with all of the infinity stones and snapped half of our universe out of existence. It was a bold move by writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directors Anthony and Joe Russo, and although there were many fanboys in the crowd who knew beforehand that what they were seeing was essentially the first part of two-act structure, the sight of many beloved superheroes dissolving into nothingness was a shock for those who had never read a comic-book in their life.[換行字元][換行字元]It's actually only been a year since Avengers: Infinity War, but the secrecy surrounding the plot of Avengers: Endgame (the title was only revealed a few months ago) has kept audiences desperate to see how the remaining heroes will react to their failure. The main question hanging over Endgame's head is how they will handle the devastation left over by Infinity War, and whether certain characters who met their demise last time around will in fact stay dead, or, as is the case in the comic-books, find their way back into the story via one of various means (cloning, parallel universes, time travel, etc.).[換行字元][換行字元]Without spoiling anything, Endgame establishes quite early on that there are indeed irreversible consequences to Thanos' victory, and no amount of magic or technological advancement can set things back to how they were. The decimation happened, and those lucky, or unlucky, enough to be left behind are forced to deal with it. Those that didn't fall victim to the snap consist of the original Avengers crew - Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), who we find drifting hopelessly in space with only Karen Gillan's Nebula for company.[換行字元][換行字元]There's also Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, an integral member of the crew and surprise no-show in Infinity War, who perhaps has more reason than anybody to avenge the loss of half of all life. The sight of Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) disappearing before our eyes may have been shocking, but Endgame's opening scene pulls the snap right back to a personal level. With his family gone, Hawkeye adopts a new persona and has taken it upon himself to take out criminal organisations Punisher-style.[換行字元][換行字元]As the trailer pointed out, people find a way to move on, but our heroes don't. Bolstered by the arrival of uber-powerful hero Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), the gang - along with Don Cheadle's War Machine and Bradley Cooper's Rocket - head into space to make Thanos pay for what he has done. Naturally, things don't go quite according to plan, but when Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) - previously believed to have been a victim when in fact he was trapped in the Quantum Realm - re-emerges with Pym technology and an ambitious plan, the Avengers are handed a glimmer of hope.[換行字元][換行字元]I'm deliberately leaving out specific plot points for fear of spoilers. This is a three-hour film, but every second counts in some way to moving the complex plot forward or explaining the mind-bending mechanics at work. While Infinity War barely paused for breath, Endgame begins on a sombre note, before launching us into a breathlessly exciting second act that serves as both as inventive way for our heroes to stand a fighting chance, and a celebration of Marvel's ground-breaking 22-film, 11-year spanning arc.[換行字元][換行字元]The third act, a colossal battle between the forces of good and evil that is almost too overwhelming to comprehend, throws lots of fancy effects and punch-ups at the screen. In most other big-budget epics, these climactic smack-downs are when my attention start to wander, but here they are involve characters I have watched evolve over the course of a decade and have grown to love, and when that Alan Silverstri score kicks in at just the right moment, the heart-flutters are inescapable. I'd also be lying if I said I didn't well up on multiple occasions. After all, we knew contracts were up and we'd be forced to say goodbye to at least one of the original heroes, but the future also looks bright for Marvel. For the moment, until Spider-Man: Far from Home arrives in a couple of months at least, Endgame is a near-perfect way to wrap up 11 years of storytelling and character-building, and a warm thank you to the fans who have been there since 2008."
3792,"Takes me back to the 70s and the big movies back then...Jaws, Star Wars, Close Encounters. The experience I had with this movie is exactly like I had with those. But the best way I can sum up this movie is with one word. UNFORGETTABLE!!! If you are a huge MCU fan you will love, be happy, and proud of this movie. It delivers in spades what you hoped and wished for."
3793,"Endgame is such a bad conclusion for the epic Avengers saga. Everything sounds predictable and even boring, as the firsr 2 hours of movie is a non-sense fanservice for HQ readers. All the hype the movie had relied only on Marvel franchise, because the movie, at best, is mediocre, even compared to the previous one. There are a few cringeworthy momments to take note: ""professor"" Hulk 4th wallish jokes, the time travel machine itself, fat drunk Thunder God Thor and the worst one: ""She's not alone"" empowered heroines against the purple male patriarch. Unless you are a fanboy or fangirl, watching this will be 3 hours less in your lifespam."
3794,"Was pretty disappointed by this sequel compared to the first movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Dialogue was cheesy and stale one liners left the character interaction very clunky and boring.[換行字元][換行字元]CGI was impressive for fight scenes, but the lame acting and lack of build up for the movie killed it for me.[換行字元][換行字元]Seriously considered to stop watching several times before movie ended, movie could have been 2 hours long and sufficed.[換行字元][換行字元]Interesting concept for plot line but I felt it was marred by poor direction, bad scene cuts and ""jump the shark"" character irrelevance.[換行字元][換行字元]Unlike the previous installment, this movie did not invoke any emotion or humor for me at all."
3795,I love everything about this movie. good job for all of people who help making this a masterpice.
3796,"Best movie Its include all satisfied ending for all characters, which are doing 11 year hard work on it but in movie not justified on stronger base characters halk & thor..... Anyway movie more EMOTIONAL as compare to action...... So Enjoy movie & hurry before anyone spoil"
3797,No amount of word could describe this wonderful piece of art.
3798,"Avengers: Endgame is no doubt the best film in the galaxy. Avengers: Endgame is full of action, sadness and also thrill. I sat in a cinema for 3 hours and a half and have never enjoyed 3 hours more. It is so much better than Infinity War and I am going to see it for a second time lol..."
3799,Kinda feels rushed through the beginning kinda wish the end was cut into one more movie because there is so much they could have done. But im pleased regardless
3800,"Badly made. First hour felt like thrown together in few minutes. Some jokes just went out too far, I was really hoping them to go away towards the end... But no. Many characters simply ruined forever, which makes no sense. I did not enjoy the movie Most of the people will say this is good because of the Fan hype. I'm a Marvel fan all the way, but this just wasn't it."
3801,Enjoyed film . 3d is good.
3802,"A fairly entertaining hero movie that, even with its long running time, doesn't really feel tiring. It begins interestingly and in pure Avengers style it becomes more and more chaotic as time progresses. This is a consequence of the too many storylines that need to be merged and the too many characters that are to be followed. Tonal shifts are omnipresent and a few characters are thrown out of context for the sake of unnecessary comic relief. With the story progressing, typical cliches of ending stories become apparent and unexplained convenient turn of events start to happen. This is nothing new and, as in the previous movies, sometimes it's just impossible to make sense of how and why a situation occurs. You have to accept it for the sake of the storyline be it someone suddenly becoming overpowered, acquiring a new power or conveniently stumbling upon a revelation. In the end, an unimpressive and quite predictable storyline spiced with great effects, a good soundtrack and a few interesting characters."
3803,(Spoiler Free) This movie was absolutely amazing! A great culmination of the last 11 years of the MCU. See it in IMAX if you can.
3804,I have Never looked forward to seeing a film in my life and i wasnt disappointed one bit brillant from start to finish
3805,I can't express the feeling here it was the best movie i have ever seen ever. I cried so much i laugh so much i scream so much just. WOW
3806,"I loved it and i hated how full of flaws it was .. the story is epic the fighting scenes sucks , the Thor power is not how it used to be in the first movie the captain marvel power is overrated . they gave too much power to iron man and captain america the truth is the cannot withstand .. i think these flaws made me question the movie a little"
3807,"This movie was the end of 22 movies... Supposed to be the most intense movie of all time. Yet infinity war had way more emotion and way better script. I even think that age of ultron was better. All they focused on was linking all the 22 movies into one and fan service. I feel for that reason it wasn't as impactful as infinity war. The way they end the characters stories was ok, i would have done it differently and done something that would make your heart drop, like they did in the first 5 min of the movie. And also they did something to a certain character and all i can say is WHY, SO STUPID. 7 may seem like a descent rating but i am very disappointed because this movie had unlimited potential and now i'll never get to see the endgame i wanted to."
3808,"Just, ah, just watch it. Its astonishing and beautiful, everything you hoped for and much much much more. I can't bring it out of me, the joy is over the top.[換行字元][換行字元]Don't wait for RIP versions, they deserve all of our money."
3809,"This is an amazing film, which I did really enjoy, and I don't think that story wise it could have been improved. But have to admit that I did prefer Infinity War. I suspect that it managed to maintain such a high octane pace throughout, this one understandably needed a slower pace for the exposition. Also there was just a bit too much humour - the consequences of the previous film are clearly devistating for those left, so the switch to more light hearted banter did not always sir so well with me. Still a must see film and a remarkable example of the true cinematic talent of Russos."
3810,What an amazing film! I wouldn't change a thing about it. The film is very long but worth every minute. A good mixture of comedy and action.[換行字元][換行字元]Advice: go to the toilet before you watch it!
3811,"Farbannad gódur, tad er hann, og heilt sikkurt verudur at hyggja eftir"
3812,"Just ..... idk .... speechless....and amazing! You have to see the movie its something you want to prepare for and diffrent point of view and breathtaking, will make you jump, scream, and cry cry and cry"
3813,The best movie ever made such a wonderful storyline one of the best creation
3814,"Don't get your hopes up, i literally cannot understand the high ratings for this movie, bad pace, bad story, Thor and hulk were both a joke in this movie, Infinity War was light years better..."
3815,The movie is just very bad writing and is an epic failure for it lacks a coherent acceptable digestible fathomable sensible reasonable story or plot .. just sucks so bad that it hurts So much is wrong that I can't begin .. but for some reason people are lying .. even critics
3816,"No movie will be like this one . The ultimate conclusion and most satisfying ending , full of real vehement emotions .."
3817,Una década culmina y de que manera... Fue de lo mejor.
3818,"Nice story, three thrilling hours. I hope for a new series"
3819,"The first hour heavily relies on comedy, but once it picks up the pace, it really is entertaining. Solid story with amazing action sequences."
3820,"They spent a lot of time in this film trying to tie up loose ends from both the past and present with some fitting scenes relating to previous movies. I loved the film but spent the first hour wondering where it is going, and how long is it going to take to get there. The big battle was both good and bad. It seemed a little messy because they were trying to give each character some on screen action time. The CGI and effects are as always amazing in the MCU films though. Lots of cheering in the cinema and clapping too which was unfortunate as many gags and punch lines got missed. I will see it again so that I can just sit and enjoy the final story but unfortunately I don't think it lived up to the hype."
3821,Incredibly EMOTIONAL and heartbreaking but satisfying!
3822,"When my brother and I watched the film, it blew our minds away. Great fight scenes and of course the humor. I want to watch it again and experience the moment. Josh Brolin was excellent playing Thanos. This is the top #1 film in the box office and in cinema history. I hope this film will win an academy award for the 2020 Oscars. Loved it and enjoyed it! MARVEL RULES!!!"
3823,"Avengers: End Game actually left me with confusions... That always remind me of how great in term of twists and storylines should be in classic movies. End Game alone and Heroes movies in general, however, havent been able to reach that level. Btw, kinda a gentle way to sump up the the whole 3 phases of Marvel Cinematic Universe. Nice visual effects and an ""kind of"" epic battle, too. #EndGame #Avengers"
3824,"What a movie, highly recommend for everyone to watch it."
3825,"The best superheroe movie ever, every single moment is unexpected with an epic end"
3826,"No spoilers, but IMHO it was over produced, over hyped, and way too long. They could easily cut 45 minutes out. I found myself checking my watch to see how long was left, not a good thing. Best description is convoluted. Even though I hope this to be the last Avengers movie, they will find other ways to milk it. I am more of a DC universe fan, though for my hubby I go for him. Not much of an audience reaction either, even though it was sold out. Note to Marcus Theater, how you run out of ice for drinks by 9 pm should be addressed, but on the other hand, 5.00 for soda means more soda for your buck. If you take kids, go early,it's a long 3 hours."
3827,"Loved, LOVED Infinity War... End Game on the other hand was utter trash. I cannot believe the Russo's directed both. I regret not walking out. The thought crossed my mind at least 3 different times."
3828,"When the plot and storyline is weak, movie makers rrsort to great publicity. This is precisely what Endgame is all about. No fizz just gas."
3829,"This was an amazing ending, to make closure on the marvel universe! Loved it!"
3830,"Avengers Endgame is perhaps one of the most anticipated movies for comic book fans. Though I myself will not refer to myself as a big fan of the genre and the MCU in general, this was a truly epic and beautiful conclusion to the 22 movies in the MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]Probably what makes this movie work wonderfully is the challenges the characters have to face. After where Infinity war ended, the characters are in a low point. They have to deal with loss and regrets from the previous movie, and some are struggling to find their purpose. They eventually all find a way out of their low point towards the end of the movie and each character has a satisfying conclusion to their arcs. Their character arcs are very intriguing and their emotional journey is very relatable. Even people like me who are not Marvel fan boys were very intrigued to the movie because of these amazing character arcs. That is probably why some of the deaths that took place in the movie was so heartbreaking even for me who hasn't saw all of the marvel movies.[換行字元][換行字元]Beyond that, this is a film that fits the phrase ""epic"". The scale of the film which spans almost all of the major plot points of the franchise feels truly epic, and the final battle sequence is just phenomenal. It is a sequence that will literally set your soul on fire and want to spring out of your seat the instance Captain America says ""Avengers assemble"". Many would say the highlights of this film are those big action sequences and time traveling sequences, but for me the best part of the movie was the ending. The ending in my opinion is the best way to close this movie packed with epic moments and character arcs. It offers a very satisfying end to the arcs of these characters built in this entire franchise, especially to Captian America who finally gets to go back to his loved one and is seen dancing before the movie ends. I will not spoil this ending because it is very good, but this movie just ends in a way that is very emotionally satisfying.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall this movie is a amazing, epic conclusion to the MCU that can be enjoyed by both comic book fans and non comic book fans like myself. I do have minor issues about how a certain character is killed off and some unclear concepts, but nothing worth bringing up. I rate it a 9/10 and I highly recommend you watch this in the theatre right away."

3832,"This movie in my opinion was considerably worse than Infinity War, too many inconsistencies and boring scenes which did not contribute much to the characters or the progression of the story. Much of the first 30-40 minutes of the film felt like filler put into the film in order to highlight the actors/actresses ability to act without many other implications to the story.[換行字元][換行字元]Hulk and Thor do steal the show completely without a doubt however. Lastly, if the aggregious product placement was not completely off putting to you, then there is not much to say."
3833,"BEST MARVEL MOVIE EVER !!!!!!!!!!!![換行字元][換行字元]""Nuf said"" -Stan Lee"
3834,"Avengers: Endgame movie is beyond all movies I have ever seen. This movie is a perfect emotional rollercoaster. This will give you goosebumps, sadness, laughing, excitement, tears of happiness and at last tears of ending. Some people might judge this review as overrated but I don't care coz I'm a truly MCU fan and I'm proud of it. Epic end of the an epic era of 11 years. Thanks Marvel...Thanks to Russo brothers and at the end Love you 3000 Iron Man."
3835,If you like spending three hours listening to explosions and ridiculous plot then this is the movie for you.
3836,Truly a celebration of the Marvel fan base and universe. Couldn't have asked for a better wrap-up. I was in tears for all of the third act.
3837,Thor has evolved as a much funnier character when we saw the glimpses in ragnarok and finally in endgame he is the only one making you laugh amid emotions and tears and ofcourse banner too brings smile to your face... Outstanding finale.. Although this movie might have pulled final curtains on some characters but for some existing it promises a exciting new beginning.. The slate is clean.. Its upto to you marvel to create another epic saga
3838,"Two hours of boring talk, 45 minutes of action. Overblown and self indulgent."
3839,After watching Infinity War I was expecting another action-packed blockbuster. Instead it was mostly a snoozefest as they tried to get everything organized for the not-so-grand finale. When it finally did get to the finale it wasn't worth the wait. If you judge it by money made it was a huge success but as a movie it was a big letdown from Infinity War.
3840,Everything I ever wanted was delivered in this movie. One word GOOSEBUMPS......
3841,They created a universe and gave it a greatest ending.
3842,"I usually hesitate to use words declarative words as best or worst. So this offering by Marvel is somewhere in between the best movie I've ever seen and the worst movie I've ever watched. This being said Endgame felt like the poem ""Casey at the bat"". All full of potential only to strike out."
3843,"If you're a follower of the MCU like myself then you don't need to read any reviews to convince you to watch this movie, it's the culmination of years of movies and a must see for fans. It's Filled with epic, emotional, sad and funny moments with tons of details for those who have been following all the previous movies, It's what you'd expect from a movie with this caliber and more. I'm excited to see what the future holds for MCU and if it's going on with the same execution as this one then i'll be really satisfied."
3844,"A colossal conclusion, a proper ending for an epic saga. It brought you to the beginning, it remind you of all the years you have invested. Then boom, here is that dessert that make you overwhelmed and craved at the same time. It closed one door to open up another, there is still a new journey ahead of us. Great execution by Joe and Anthony Russo!"
3845,"This is a awesome movie with some great moments that had the whole theater fired up and cheering , little slow for the first 30 in the beginning but gets so exciting and doesn't feel Ike like a 3 hour movie. Take the family and go see it."
3846,A family of movies to be treasured until each of our own end games
3847,"This is the finale the marvel cinematic universe deserves and it is a masterpiece. It surpasses your expectations no matter how high they are. The way they put together everything in place, the comedy, the drama ,the action, everything on point. Thanos - The most badass villain in the history of cinema. The Final act - Perfection. The directors could not have done it better even if they wanted too. Watching it once is not enough."
3848,"Excellently tied in with the previous movies, nice fan service elements, Downey Jr on form again."
3849,"You could be the type of person that completely tears apart this movie, and point out its inconsistencies plot holes. Of course their are these things, and that is my problem with the movie. But I look past that, and I am the type of person who enjoys the entire 3 hours and 2 minutes of this movie."
3850,"Good, solid, jumbled, chaotic, messy, OTT, PC fun that lacked the stakes, sincerity, intimacy, cohesiveness and the opposing narrative mastery of the utterly brilliant Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]A love letter to fans? Yes, in the comic book sense but films are not comics, the MCU films are inspired by comics. Film craft is drastically different than book or comic. If you're judging Avengers Endgame by the Russo brothers usual excellent MCU standards, who've mostly managed to please comic fans then the Easter egg laden love letter to fans was at the cost of their ability to craft a visual narrative as well as they have in the past.[換行字元][換行字元]A film is the sum of all its parts like a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. To me, this film was more a trojan horse - it felt it was to service future MCU characters than the current - disguised as a love letter. A film should be made to cater for its own ingredients and not to aid others work, past or future, whilst risking not only deflating your own achievements but literally undoing current cinematic sense, logic, reason and reward in order to draw more cash later over a compelling and ripping yarn now.[換行字元][換行字元]Suspension of disbelief was mostly removed from this film at the cost of a minefield of forced 'just for laughs' and up-and-coming MCU 'product placement'. The film wasn't allowed to stand alone or, at least stand side-by-side with Infinity War. It felt like the Brothers had orders and those reshoots and last minute edits caused the many, 'what could and should have been' gripes from fans and, potentially the beginning of the End of the MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]It was a good film, but that's the problem, it should have been far more. There's plenty of good films. What about classic = 5/5 or Great = 4/5. Evidently the Brothers have a knack for turning out classic MCU, what was with the epic-in-scale but overall 3/5 flick?[換行字元][換行字元]I could write forever but I can't in fear of giving away spoilers. What I will say is, if they can make Thanos, one of the greatest and most misguided cinematic villains of all time become just another baddie seemingly overnight then you can imagine what occurred to some of the other beloved characters in this film. On occasion the OG6 feel entirely forgotten/forgettable and that they're merely in the way of the new, which is odd because it took 10 years to build their arch whilst the likes of Captain Marvels arch is, 'just is'. One film. Boom. We seemingly know all there is to know in less than 2hrs and we're expected to except that because we're told to. The potential future of the MCU could be on a path of, 'just is'. Call me old fashioned but I enjoy character development and risk vs reward vs loss etc. 'Just is', isn't compelling enough for me. Very soon, 'just is' won't be enough full stop.[換行字元][換行字元]In short there's a lot to like in Endgame just as there was in The Return of the Jedi. That about sums up Avengers 4 really. There are people out there who love Jedi and there are others who thought Empire Strikes Back should have had a much, much stronger follow up. And, what happened to the quality of the Star Wars Universe beyond Jedi?[換行字元][換行字元]I've a terrible feeling Phase 4 killed the MCU before Phase 4 even got off the ground..."
3851,"The best of marvel, a rollercoaster of emotions im not yet recovered of this epicness. Very good even if you dont like suoerheroes movies"
3852,"I am sorry if i have a bad grammar, i just want to make review for this amazing movie. i think this movie is complete, the comedy, drama, romance, action, that's all in one movie. i laugh much than i ever do on other movie, i cried 2 times more than i ever do on other movie. I give my 10 stars for you all, the hero who made my life not flat anymore.[換行字元][換行字元]and for the record, i think the story is unpredictable."
3853,"Avengers: Endgame was the perfect conclusion to the current MCU as we know it. The intricate focus to details that call back to practically all the previous 21 films is genius. There are great laughs, emotional cries and overwhelmingly exciting surprises. To any fan of the MCU that's followed these beloved characters since Day 1, this is everything and more. I loved it."
3854,"I'll start by saying before Infinity War, I always thought that most Marvel films were a 6 or 7 out of 10 for me, they were all enjoyable, however the thing they so drastically lacked was a strong baddie. My issue with the first Avengers was Loki being so non threatening, and everyone I talk to about this seems to agree, however the breakthrough at the time was just to have all their heroes on screen together. You then had Avengers Age of Ultron, which had the baddie being a creation of Tony Stark, which I found unexciting, despite it being a fun watch. The two impressive Captain America sequels, the third of which had our heroes fighting against each other, again something I found to be a little underwhelming.[換行字元][換行字元]Then came Infinity War, which for me totally raised the bar, and properly introduced one of the most threatening, and in my opinion Iconic baddies we have seen on the screen since Nolans Bane in TDKR. I was extremely dissapointed to not see more people dressed up as the mad titan last Halloween (no shortage of Harley Quinns and Jokers still). Infinity War ended with what is unquestionably the greatest shock in superhero film history, which then set up what promised to be a fascinating follow up.[換行字元][換行字元]This film did not disappoint, and even if you are not a fan of superhero movies in general, I would strongly urge any film fan to at least watch both Infinity War and Endgame both. I am certain even the most hard nosed film critic (the type that boo every film at Cannes) can appreciate the quality of film-making on display here.[換行字元][換行字元]I have seem some passionate YouTubers making videos about plot-holes being uncovered throughout this film, however given the direction the story took, I can imagine the difficulty the filmmakers had weaving this all together, and I am confident they did the best they could.[換行字元][換行字元]Essential viewing."
3855,"Exhilarating, breathtaking culmination to the Infinity Saga delivers in every way."
3856,"Such a high tension left from Infinity war , and then such fast bad solutions...with nonsense. bad sense of humor. i was disappointed. Maybe for teenagers around 14-15 years old thats pretty ok."
3857,A well thought out film that fulfils the fans wants and needs. Great acting from all involved.
3858,This movie is the greatest movie I have ever seen so far. The greatest conclusion we can get for marvel and a wonderful warp up for the infinity saga. I mean so parts of the movie were a bit iffy but overall this is a great movie. I give it a 9.2/10
3859,"Perhaps there are to many people that hate this movie, and other that love, personally, I love it, its beautiful, a gift for us, the last minutes I've smiled and cried. Obviously it's a good movie, but something is wrong, I dont know what it's but something is odd, and it taste strange, but everything have to end, right?"
3860,"Like the final chapter of a great book or the final boss of a video game - the ending of this movie leaves me with a bittersweet feeling of 'that was freaking amazing, what do I do with my life now it's over???' It captures that perfect feeling of The End. Yet it does leave doors open for different characters to do more, but for this overreaching arc and storyline extending back all the way from Iron Man 1, it's the end. And what a beautiful end it is. There is so much about this movie that I came out the cinema just raving about. I loved so many parts of it, I loved so many of the characters, and the story direction and even some of the cinematography was mind blowing. This film wholeheartedly deserves a watch and a 10/10. Marvel's masterpiece. (Also I feel that strongly about it that I made an IMDb account just to review this movie)"
3861,Went in with very high expectation because of IW (I watched IW 3 times) and the inclusion of Capt Marvel (didn't like the movie thou). It got some good moments (milking the sadness of defeat) and some clever and inspirational lines (which I think is very important for superhero movies that mcu a bit lacking). Sometimes the jokes came in the way of the emotional moments thou. Felt a bit uneven overall. Hope for so much more from Capt Marvel but ... And bit sad looking at Hulk and Thor become victim of plot. It's quite a mixed feeling movie for me. Just an ok I guess?
3862,This is the best movie ever nothing can or will beat avengers endgame
3863,"It's so hard to review something that I feel that every fan felt on such an emotion level - it's definitely something you just have to go and experience for yourself.it's very good - you'll laugh, you'll cry, it'll change your life."
3864,"Watched this movie last week .I have to say that i did'nt like this one as much as i liked Infinity wars.I found it to be predictable in parts plus it was way too mushy for me in certain bits.There was way too much hype for this ,i came out of the theatre pretty disappointed ."
3865,"What can we say? The best part of this movie is that we won't get any more Avenger movies. I won't go into spoilers, to ruin the fun for someone. But in my personal view, the movie does the series no justice. I'd say it buries it. From overused tropes and reused cliches, Endgame feels low budget, with lazy writing, lacking character development. Also, I can't wrap my head around the fact that so many reviews on IMDB come from users with fresh accounts, a few days old, that give this movie stellar ratings. My oh my, how the mighty have fallen, and silently accepted ""vote brigading"", probably for a few bucks for some server expenses."
3866,"Well must say,i didnt watch the movie when it hit the theaters and althought i am a big fan of the franchise. I didnt expect a lot, thought i must be a slower pace to tell the story of the world that was created, yet.... it was damn to slow and borin. Without the death of Nat and Iron Man it would be like a Hallmark production. And even the final battle scene was like a copy paste from the last Averngers. Than Captain Marvel was like 5 sec to see, the funny part was only Thor and Hulk?! What the hell was that? I never liked Mark Ruffalo as Hulk but i let it pass, but here in the last Avengers... am actually glad i didnt get to see it in the cinema, would habe been waste of my money"
3867,Fell asleep during the first hour. Too much talking. Realized this movie was for the new generation. Nick Fury finally makes an appearance during the last five minutes of the movie. Three hours of my life I can never get back. Gag me with a Smurf!
3868,"Though a slow burn, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a satisfying, heart-wrenching and entertaining end (not really an end) to Marvel's 22-film saga."
3869,"Good Again watch It's stuck landing amazing movie, fantastic"
3870,"This movie has Infinity stones and infinite loopholes. It's stupidity of director and actors to bring this garbage script to fruition but it's idioticity of all us to watch it. It's almost sad that what rises to top is not the best but mediocrity, and in this case, nonsense."
3871,"Enjoyable movie that takes to long to get into the action and doesn't make any sense once you step back and think about what they've done. Even their explanations on what they were going to do, what they did do, and the final outcomes make no sense. I believe the world would be an even bigger mess when they were done, and Steve broke all the rules!"
3872,"Best in each ounces of scenes,unbelievable actions,superb story,bestest entries and excellent in everything! MUST WATCH!!!!"
3873,Way to long of a movie probably could of cut an hour out of it and it wouldn't have made a difference. Probably one of the worst Avenger movies I've seen. Very slow to get to the point and it do not hold my interest or my husband's.
3874,The best movie I have ever seen in my whole life Thanks Marvel

3878,"Yes, you heard it right. It was very badly written. Like the time-travel system is so weird. They tried to be unique with it but failed."

3881,"I love it 3000 times, it's amazing, it's a great movie, it's a great moment and perfect movie"
3882,"Well, there's no two ways about a Marvel movie: all out CGI, rib tickling humour, emotions, a very minimalistic feel of a possible romantic link up, catchy one-liners - all offered in a close to a 3hrs movie (to get the viewer interested in each one of the characters is a task no human can be 100% successful at) - as expected. All said and done, it's well worth the hype, and the wait. I still remember the good old days (at the start of Ironman franchise) thinking Ironman is meant to do something bigger.

3883,"This movie is a loveletter to the entire MCU with lots of callbacks to the previous movies and gives nearly every characterarc a fullfilling conclusion. Some of these will continue in upcoming sequels, but as a last Avengers movie it is a great final round with lots of impressive moments to remember."

3886,It was alright. Lots of potholes and not much action.
3887,"Couldn't imagine a better way to finish this saga of 21 movies. It was a slow, emotional, fast, fun movie... all the best ingredients to make it a ten out of ten unforgettable epic movie. Well done, you did a great job! I enjoyed every second and almost dropped a tear at one point:)"
3888,"Avengers Endgame had a lot going for it: It serves as the conclusion to a 22-movie saga, it is the sequel to one of the most devastating MCU events (and a one year wait after it) and it must also serve as a satisfying conclusion to all the heroes we watched. The last time, the stakes were so complex, we got Age of Ultron... So we knew the result of too many complex plots in one offering.[換行字元][換行字元]So the Russos had a huge thing going on this movie and boy do they exceed expectations as this is THE MOVIE we had been waiting for. Consider your expectations of some top moments you had in your head and this movie brings 3x the amount to it...[換行字元][換行字元]This movie has it all... Emotion, Comedy, and boy oh boy, the Action. And best of all, an actual CONSEQUENCE OF ACTIONS. Infinity War's conclusion ain't a gimmick that is resolved. It has lasting consequences which I have expected given the same Russos handled Civil War and it's ramifications...[換行字元][換行字元]This is THE MOVIE EVENT that changes you and I can safely would say to the future generations that man I lived during the MCU times and it was worth it. Being an Indian, I did not get the Star Wars phenomenon and now being a part of the MCU journey, I can understand the utter hype when you see the various people in the theatres with their Iron man and Cap's shirts.[換行字元][換行字元]I'm glad to be part of this event and I'm going to be going more times..."
3889,This movie was incredible I did like avengers infinity I thought no over marvel film would top it but some how avengers end game has beat marvel movie ever and one of the best of all time.
3890,"That was just Bad ...boaring and predictable And the ending was sooo much Hollywood Drama, the scene with Captain America just killed me... Oh my, was that Bad.[換行字元][換行字元]Go and watch Infinity War again... Hope that this was the End.."
3891,First 2 hours of nothing with stupid humor just to make some children laugh and then while getting closer to the final battle... Still the same one liners to make us laugh... I won't even mention the storyline and it's plot holes... Everything in this movie is wrong... The Endgame destroys whatever marvel was building for 12 years!!! It's a disgrace and great disrespect to all our favorite heroes who are portrayed as a parody of themselves (Thor and Hulk especially)... This film is clearly not made for marvel fans.. Such a shame... Because for me last year's AVENGERS film was simply the best superhero movie of all time... The Endgame unfortunately was just a family comedy... 😠
3892,"Not a bad movie by any means, more of a comedy with action kind of movie (which spoils the action most of the time). Typical marvel if you liked marvel movies before end game you'll like this. Nothing special about the movie imo. Same old stuff"
3893,"Avengers Endgame Movie - in a word you can say ""Marvel-lous"".[換行字元][換行字元]It is very thrilling, emotional, action packed and remarkable MCU Avengers Saga. A superheroic masterpiece that delivers everything it promised. I will watch it again and again."
3894,No spoilers at all just go and watch this immensely epic culmination to the saga. Truly breathtaking. Just wow.
3895,"Very good finish off of the series, although the first hour of the film was a bit dull😕"
3896,"I'm not going to spoil anything. All I have of say is I laughed, I cried, and I got chills down my spine throughout the whole movie. The theater was packed to the rim, and everyone in my row got up in tears. This movie might have been the best I have ever seen, and I will definitely watch it again and again once it come out on the tv. Definitely as good as infinity war, and in my opinion better. If you love the avengers, you will love this movie."
3897,"It was suppose to be the most anticipating movie for any marvel fans after waiting for over a decade, but alas the story line was just repeating itself, rather lets just call it Avengers: Endgame repeated stories from the past films! time travel was another huge disappointment! shows real lazy writing, screen cast etc! there are more than 14 million ways the screenwriter and director could have made it different! a few punch lines and the end fight was only worth the money spent for watching it! as a whole i would just say sorry marvel you just lost it ! please don't bring back anymore of your films! you just lost a huge fan after watching this crap! sayonara Marvel, and i hope nobody watches your upcoming stupid spider-boy with a dumb brain!"
3898,"Avengers Endgame follows the events 23 days after Thanos did the 'big snap'. The remaining Avengers are shattered and broken, with Tony Stark stuck in space. Nobody has a clue how to bring the others back or kill the ultimate super-villain. How will this end though? - With ABSOLUTE perfection. The culmination of the 21 Marvel movies ends ties the knots into a perfect little bow, with of course some heartbreaking losses. The ending, without post-credits too, is very satisfying. Russo brothers add a dramatic punch to the 3 hour storyline, as well as plenty of humour in the first half. The second half however, is action packed, and emotions run sky-high. The end will and has shattered me, as well as brought a ray of hope along with it. Although jumping with the timelines, catching up with old times can be confusing, and it has stretched the movie a tad bit, but that's the idea. Of bringing a conclusion. Which it does. Who knew even end credits could also be so satisfying? Some actors do get a better screentime, although I found the distribution better than Infinity War. The whistles, shrieking, whooping, occasional sniffling and clapping throughout the entire length of the movie is proof enough of how EPIC the film is. The film is a roller coaster of emotions, funny in one. exhilarating in the next, and emotional in the end. No questions about the set design, action and special effects, it's larger than life and top-notch It's a tearjerker, and bound to leave a void, but its feels like a good conclusion. It's a lot to take in, for sure. Did I mention how many times I said the word satisfying? I swear, MCU will never be the same without Avengers. Love you 3000."
3899,I got nothing to say but this movie is the best i have ever seen in my life
3900,This movie made me laugh and cry. This movie no one was prepared for. This movie had so many false theories. This movie was by far my favorite movie
3901,"All that I can say is, that I loved it 3000, and that the movie was extremely good. There was good action, good humor and overall it was a very emotional and well done film."
3902,"I admit, I am not the greatest MCU fan in the world. I love award winning films such an ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""The Godfather"" however the high reviews suggested that this film could be a Brilliant film, not just the average MCU movie which would be okay but not great. After watching the first few minutes of this feature I thought to myself how this is actually a great film. After watching the first hour I thought to myself how this actually isn't great but still good for marvel standard. After watching the first two hours I thought to myself how this film is inconsistent and mediocre. Finally, after watching the end of the film, I thought to myself how this film is on the lower end of generic and that instead of cleverly addressing how everybody is equal, this film just yells in your women and black people are better than men and white people, which could be easily ignored if not made so in your face. I'm sorry you hyper-marvel fans but I have to say that the best DC films are better than the best Marvel films (even though the worst DC films are worse then the worst Marvel films) and unless somebody has come up with an idea to make an marvel Dark knight, DC will be in the lead with the three (probably five best as soon as I see the first two superman films) best superhero films of all time."
3903,"Not only the best marvel film, the best overall film I've ever seen."
3904,"I appreciated the movie greatly. They handled time travel in a very deft fashion, and tied it up nicely. I appreciate that they managed to maintain stakes for future installments.[換行字元][換行字元]I have been a marvel fan since MY beginning. I read the comics as a kid, and made my own costumes. I latched onto the MCU from film 1 and have been there for every up and down of the franchise. I am proud of how they brought this era to a close."
3905,"I'm so excited and awesome. I didn't expect the movie is gonna be this much adorable. I'm strongly saying that the movie is gonna break all the box office record.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame tamil version General Tamil audience like it however, It's disappointing for all the marvel fans including me.[換行字元][換行字元]To understand the Tamil fans of Marvel please have a look at this link and Hashtag"
3906,"This was truly the first time that as I was watching, I felt like I immediately recognized a movie's future significance. The duology of Infinity War and Endgame, I believe, will be remembered as the pinnacle of superhero movies. That's all there is to it."
3907,"This might be if not the greatest movie ever created. I cried, I laughed, I cheered... this movie has everything and is a perfect end to the story"
3908,I loved this movie very good secances and good artist
3909,"Being a big fan of the Marvel Universe I was very disappointed to first sit through two hours of a very weird, boring and depressing Inception-like Movie. They had a lot of good ideas but didn't manage to make it a good movie. If you can just skip the first two hours and watch the ending. I was so pissed when the good parts came that I had a hard time really enjoying them."
3910,Went see it tonight and wow This movie is epic[換行字元][換行字元]Recommend
3911,"Amazing (almost) end game fit the infinity phase of Avengers Movies. Several scenes brought mass applause and cheering throughout the movie. Love, love, loved the commitment to the MCU characters who started it all. I'm saying top 5 but my 12 year old son is giving it top 3 status. Will be adding to the box office gross to see this one in theaters again 👍💵😍"
3912,"My kids were very excited to see this but I was more apprehensive. Really, the film is far too long, just unnecessarily. Parts of this film were very boring and were an ideal time for a cinema snooze! It had so much more potential but directors lost site of their aim. Disappointed."
3913,The movie is just amazing and justice was done to infinity war..[換行字元][換行字元]But don't read too much reviews and over expect.. I heard about so many crying scenes.. And the movie was over and I was waiting for more... Expect less and enjoy the master piece![換行字元][換行字元]End of this era!
3914,10/10 my favourite movie so far. Avengers Endgame is a best closure and the best superhero movie what I ever seen! A.E. has got a really complex characteristic and emotions. That movie's biggest strenght is the characters and their's emotions. The best part is the begining. The movie's first part is the most mature and advanced part. Because of that this movie is rising from the other superhero movie. The time travel was the most exciting part. With so many reference and unforgottable dialogues and jokes. Back to the past stories of MCU and live it again. It was incredibly good experience. And the End: The big final battle:That was a coronation of that historic ending.
3915,"I've grown up with the MCU with Iron Man coming out when I was 5 years old. I love this series and it's sad that the main saga is over but I expected a bit more. I gave Infinity War a 9/10 because of its amazing pace, fun characters and unexpected gut-wrenching ending, but this film has sluggish and inconsistent pacing, ruined character arcs (like Hulk as in IW he was afraid to even show himself but now they sorted everything out... Off screen), and a very predictable story and ending. I'm not even joking when I say that (even though my prediction was slightly different) my prediction to the film was extremely accurate to the films events.[換行字元][換行字元]To conclude, I watched Infinity War 3 times in cinemas and who knows how many times on Blu-Ray, but I've only seen Endgame once and have no intention of seeing it again anytime soon: I liked it, but was overall disappointed."
3916,Just got back from the midnight showing and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. I get that its the final avengers movie but they spent two hours paying homage to previous films and characters and retread a lot of the original plot. In doing so they effectively dulled Thanos's presence and much of the enjoyment of the movie. I hate to say it but Captain Marvel seemed like a useless addition as she really didn't bring much to the table and her presence ruins Thanos's threat. Anyway the production values were great and it was nice to see all the characters make an appearance in some form but it wasn't bet foot to go out on.
3917,"It's impossible to watch a film of this much scale, history, cultural importance, and franchise-carrying characters in a vacuum. No other franchise has the balls, nor the emotional buildup that it carries to justify a 3-hour runtime in a world where those kinds of runtimes are limited to fantasy epics (Lord of the Rings) or old glorious 70 millimeter films (Lawrence of Arabia). I guess that's what best describes Endgame, it is a glorious and grossly satisfying epic, and one that will soon become a classic etched and immortalized in the cultural consciousness of a generation.[換行字元][換行字元]If there's one thing that Marvel has done properly, its understanding how to do good on their characters. The MCU has thrived because it has consistently followed a philosophy of putting characters first. There is a reason why this movie broke pre-sale records, why there were cheers, tears and rounds of applause from the audience in each shining moment of the film. Endgame takes Marvel's character-driven storytelling to its extreme and most appealing. Infinity War largely proved how Marvel knows how to divide it characters, unite them all with one common threat and theme, and deliver a punch in the gut ending that had fans dusting their tears.[換行字元][換行字元]At the start of Endgame, fans are at the same emotional headspace as their favorite characters who are at a loss for hope. Right off the bat, the Russo brothers as directors have put themselves in a corner that allowed them to find a creative way out of it. Together with screenplay writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the story feels more rich, poignant, and satisfying. It goes without saying that you shouldn't go into this film expecting a high-art, indie slow burner, it still flows and feels very much like a Marvel movie, but the difference is that it is more restrained. The film opts for quieter, relaxed, and introspective scenes between characters. Steve, Tony, Clint, Natasha, Thor, and Banner all get their moments to shine, and it's clear that this is the original six's movie if Infinity War was Thanos'.[換行字元][換行字元]Each fan service moment feels earned, despite it being obviously shameless and pandering, it feels like the Avengers can justify showing off a little especially after 11 years of buildup. Nothing beats the collective gasps and thunderous applause you get from the audience whenever each iconic moment occurs. Endgame is clearly, unapologetically, and triumphantly made for the fans. Each scene, each line of dialogue and each callback is constructed passionately and with care. No arcs in the last 11 years were left forgotten and left in the dust.[換行字元][換行字元]As an epilogue to the now titled ""Infinity Saga"", this film works best as the season finale of a long running cinematic television epic. If you see it that way, you'll understand the motivations behind the creative decisions that the filmmakers made. Each plot point may feel overused or something you've seen before, but the people behind the scenes know it and even acknowledge it within the film. It doesn't mean they are unmotivated, but rather the opposite, they use it to stunning effect for incredibly emotional payoffs that honestly feels like a miracle that they managed to pull it off.[換行字元][換行字元]In the end, what more is there to say about this movie? Aside from its consistently stunning visuals, creative cinematography, coherent action set pieces, and kick-ass musical score, this film is all about emotion and getting the catharsis you've always wanted as a fan, a normal moviegoer, or as a little kid. Some people grew up with the MCU, 11 years is a damn long time and I'm definitely part of those who did. I guess this is what those kids in the 70s-80s felt when they saw Star Wars.[換行字元][換行字元]Verdict: 4.8/5"
3918,Basically there was 2 hours of crying then action then 30 minutes of action and finally topped it off with 30 more minutes of more crying! I fell asleep at the beginning! Infinity war was a much better movie!
3919,"Unpopular opinion. there are too many plot holes, not an epic movie opposed to what fanboys think. Entertaining but slow paced.I watched IW thrice but wouldn't like to see endgame again."
3920,"This movie is awesome! If you're a marvel fan you will enjoy this but then again you have probably already seen it. It's funny, emotional and clever. Yeah it is very long and most definitely could have been shortened but I just enjoy the characters so much I don't even mind."
3921,"This is a great movie indeed but not the greatest superhero movie, loved every bit and a satisfying ending"
3922,"Amazing film, and definitely worth watching. The pace was slower, but there was a lot of story building. I would rather that they built a story than to leave me guessing. However, I felt there was a little more emotional depth than I expected from a superhero movie... Not sure that I am complaining. Will definitely watch this one again! It was EPIC!"
3923,"Movie is a little long. There are scenes that could have been made shorter or cut out completely. A LOT of exposition. Feels like we're being spoon fed what they are planing to do the majority of the movie. A cringe worthy feminist girl moment that makes your eyes roll. There was no subtlety there. The movie was a little messy with pacing but show a lot of heart.[換行字元][換行字元]There were two characters that I took a little issue with. Captain Marvel- Irritating and nasty with the few lines she does have. Really felt Brie Larson bleeding through the character with comments like ""well, you didn't have me last time"". I feel no respect for this character or actress and hope they remove her sooner rather than later.[換行字元][換行字元]Thor- Funny but the character seems to be dumbed down a little too much. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan and enjoy humor but this schtick went on a little too long.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie has a lot of really solid comedy, heart felt moments, and action. Yeah it has some plot holes but the over all story is good and a fair way to end Phase 4."
3924,"Ok so it's 3 hours long, believe me the time flies. This film is engaging, thrilling, emotional and breathtaking. Not over the top but serious fun."
3925,"I cried so hard during the whole thing, and it was worth it. I loved every aspect of the movie and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much!!"
3926,"The film is harmonious and consistent. Each hero is a cog of a large mechanism. Emotional background rolls over. Amazing completion of the saga. Where is the end, there is the beginning of something new."
3927,"You may have seen many supehero movies in your lifetime. But i can guarentee you that this is the best one you can see upto now. Its not only action, But also emotions. This is the kind of movie that gives you goosebumps. HIghly recommended. But to get the full of it you should have a basic understanding of MCU. 10/10 for me."
3928,Simply amazing. Marvel topped off the saga. Thanos is the best of the best. Love 3000 squared...
3929,"Wow, this film is a superb culmination of every single Avengers film. You possibly could've seen more of Captain Marvel but seeing as she's a late edition it didn't seem that out of place.[換行字元][換行字元]I was amazed with the preemptive thought that went into this final edition. Every scene that passed, I had to take a breath, everything seemed to gel effortlessly, although at the same time seemed complicated. The film is a masterclass and I'm gutted, but as they say, all good things come to an end......"
3930,Great words of wisdom in this one with such powerful POC & feminine representation. At times a large portion of the theater was crying. I must see it a couple more times.
3931,"Now I am going to put it out there that although I gave this a 10/10 it was not perfect. I enjoyed Infinity War more also. It was a great movie though, a true event and a worthy and somewhat emotional end to an epic saga. Yes, I know there will be other Marvel movies and who knows some of the old guard may return but it did kind of feel like a befitting end to many of the original characters. Thor and the Guardians were super fun, Hulk was the best he has been, Cap was truly stoic, for once I actually liked Hawkeye and Ant-Man was a laugh a minute. The plot made sense and although far fetched, who cares, most comics and superhero movies are. The action sequences were awesome also. My only gripe was that there was probably not enough action. The first couple of hours was bringing everyone together and giving us and many of the characters a chance to reminisce and feel the nostalgia. It really was at times moving and emotional especially Cap and Stark and their back stories. Then there was the final battle which was epic and moving end. Some characters cane full circle, some found happiness and some didn't and there was a set up for a few more movies and collaborations in the future. A truly great movie. I was hoping for better but at the same time was in no way disappointed. Avengers you will be missed but I have a feeling there might be more to come. The comic Avengers team have a wide and varied history and different versions of the team could keep reinventing the wheel. Will it be able to reinvent the magic, the chemistry and the love we have for this team though, I don't know. Thanks for the fun many happy memories to all involved in this franchise."
3932,So much advertising for a movie.. I saw the avengers faces everywhere ..even on cola's cans at the supermarket... Was it worth it? Nope. It was boring.
3933,"So yeah.. finally.. Watched it earlier but couldn't come to grips with the end of an Era for me ..With this seems my adolescence is finally over![換行字元][換行字元]Iron Man got me hooked to the MCU, Cap America gave me hope, Thor and Banner gave me great comic book moments and Loki ;) , Hawkeye and Black widow gave friendship goals, Guardians gave us super fun, Spidey brought a refreshing change, Ant Man made science fun, and not to Forget, Thanos oozed Dread and a terrifyingly humanesque approach in willing to go to any lengths to do what he believes is right!

3934,"The best from all mcu universe . Combining visually best action , humour ,suspense , emotions . A must watch . Best story among mcu ."
3935,Wow.wow.wow.wow.wow. The culmination of 22 MCU movies leaves you just saying wow. They did it. They pulled it off. Thank you.
3936,It looked like a cartoon movie. I think the director showcased in the movie whatever he saw in his dream.
3937,"Amazing wrap-up to the 11 years and 22 movies in the MCU. Looking forward to the future phase 4 onwards. Well acted and probably the best ever performances from Downey, Evans, Gillan and Johansson. Many callbacks and fan service to die hard fans but well spent fan service."
3938,I genuinely respect for the Russo Brothers for taking the direction they did with Endgame and it really does satisfy but Infinity War is overall a more entertaining movie. It's not the best MCU movie but I can't dispute its great conclusion. 3 hours of visual treat i must say. Going with 9/10
3939,Yes I have expected a lot... But slightly disappointed... Still the movie has some remarkable scenes which we might experienced for the first time ..[換行字元][換行字元]All on all a 9... Just because first half is really lengthy. Expecting little more action.. Happy with the second half but screen time of characters is very less....
3940,"Some things that we already imagined happened, but there's much more to come"
3941,No one could predict the endgame of the Endgame before.
3942,"This is the most amazing movie I've ever seen, i have watched all the marvel franchise numerous times but this tops everything. It was extremely well acted, the actors and actresses should be greatly credited. Very emotionally impacting, which was done beautifully well. Hopefully not giving any spoilers, it has (in my opinion) the best battle scene i have ever seen. This is a brilliant way to finish the infinity saga and i look forward to see what marvel brings next, though i don't think it will ever be the same again, i hope anyone who reads this enjoyed or will enjoy it as much as i did, marvel you are truly amazing."
3943,"I watch this movie today everything is good in this movie, but also have some unanswered questions which we didn't get....!"
3944,It is very good wonderful and amazing . i had never seen a movie like that very better than infinity war and .......(the best things) you should see this
3945,The best marvel films in history!! You need to see that movie!
3946,"One just gets the sense that this movie took a subtle yet noticeable shift away from what captured many people's hearts in the earlier MCU movies.[換行字元][換行字元]The actors give off the feeling of being forced to portray a role that used to be natural fits in order to impose various woke messages. There are so many but they come at a rate of every couple of minutes, ranging from blatant grrl power, to emasculation and so on. Muddling along.[換行字元][換行字元]Aside from the odd action scenes, this movie could pass as a drama."
3947,Hands down the best movie I've ever watched. I urge every one how doesn't like superhero movies to give the MCU a shot. They've created something incredible over 11 years of great movies and memories!
3948,"When i left the cinema after my first inital watch, i was blown away. I had some minor gripes and flaws, but was very content with what i had seen. Probably a solid 8.5/10 at the time. Months later i have had time to dwell on the movie and craft my own opinion and well, it's very messy. It's not bad, but the more you think about it's flaws the clearer they become. For a start, the pacing suffers, mainly in the 2nd act. Some scenes feel pointless, unneccessary and slugish. Another thing that i absolutely hated in this movie was multiple chatacter arcs including Black widow and Captain Marvel especially. Black widows Character arc felt extremely rushed and forced. I wont spoil much, but i thought it was handled poorly. The character of Captain Marvel also felt extremely thrown in. Perhaps the messiest part of the movie was the Time Travel. I wont go into detail, but it was all over the place and the characters go agains the rules of time travel multiple times. Finally, there was a lot in the last act that did not make much sense. I again wont go into detail, but multiple scenes felt forced and Thanos' character felt off as the directors have tried to portray him in a more sinister light, which doesnt work because it completely forgets his personality in Infinity War. Overall, this is not a bad movie and there is lots to praise which i wont go into because its been said many times over. It just has extremely noticable flaws that grow larger and larger the more you think on it. Avengers Endgame - 6.9/10 Avengers Infinty War - 8/10"
3949,Dont agree with what Marvel decided for Black Widow ..and no acknowledgement for her! Some Great scenes and twists! All around great! Boo on no post credit scenes!
3950,"This is gonna go down as one of the best movies of all times, definitely the best movie of the year. Truly epic, funny, happy, fulfilling but sad and heartbreaking"
3951,"I remember ten years ago when I was a comic book fan and the whispers that were coming out about a Thanos Avengers movie blew my mind. Infinity War satisfied that desire greatly, but Endgame is a mixed bag. I came out of the cinema feeling rather underwhelmed.[換行字元][換行字元]To be sure, the action is superb. The last half hour of action made me grin from ear to ear and it gave me a similar feeling to watching Return of the King for the first time. However, it was a long road to get to that point.[換行字元][換行字元]The film is too long. Far too long. It carries far too much baggage from the last movie and drags its heels, which in turn creates a jarring tonal discordance from quipping-Marvel fun to apocalyptic moping. Stop telling me how important things are. I know. Show me why they're important.[換行字元][換行字元]Another problem I have is the story. It never felt like I was watching one. Infinity War was a hectic race against the clock, Endgame felt like I was watching a board meeting of writers and executives discussing how they're going to tie up loose ends. This is a movie that serves a cinematic universe owned by Disney, rather than serving to tell us a story.[換行字元][換行字元]Without discussing spoilers, the plot is far too convoluted. The all-powerful Infinity Gems created enough plotholes you have to ignore, but adding time travel to the mix compounds this even further. It would be fine if the movie just dismissed these plotholes, but it keeps harping on the precise mechanics of how the time travel works in the MCU over and over, forcing me to think about how it makes no sense over and over. I don't like thinking about plotholes but Endgame just kept reminding me of them. Combined with the length this makes a large amount of the movie rather a chore to sit through.[換行字元][換行字元]You must think I hate this movie after that, but I don't. The positives are the ones that come with the standard Marvel movie, funny writing, excellent music, effects, acting and likable characters. I'm certainly glad to have seen it, but unlike Infinity War, it wears out it's welcome after the first viewing."
3952,"At a first viewing I loved the movie, but at a second viewing I ""merely liked it""[換行字元][換行字元]I think the sentimentality made the first viewing so special, but then you see all the flaws. Still a very good movie and a satisfactory conclusion to many many hours spent in MCU:s company."
3953,"A wonderful and amazing movie for all the fans. So much emotions, so many nostalgic moments, and action, humor, drama! We get to see all the superheroes and some more loveable characters. I feel sorry for those who try to find scientific logic in a movie about superheros. You really need to focus on what's important. Just enjoy!"
3954,"I am not going to give any spoilers here, but WOW. This movie is everything a marvel/MCU fan could want, emotional, yet satisfying, and the humour is just so good, sometimes one may even forget the sad parts. $1.2 billion made in the world wide box office in just 3 days of the movie's global release! biggest box office first day collection yet! Avengers: Endgame is truly one big and memorable ending to the first 11 years of the MCU and the 22 movies before it. It is certainly something that MCU fans have always wanted, but never expected. I laughed, I cheered, but in the end, I couldn't stop crying. People in the cinema were cheering and laughing louder than I have ever heard anyone cheer for any movie yet, although there were moments when the whole audience went silent. Not even 1 week since it's release and Avengers: Endgame has already broken so many world records! From the visuals and CGI/VFX to the way that the story is handled and shown, A TRULY PERFECT MOVIE IN EVERY WAY."
3955,"Finally my waiting moments came to end, movie is really awesome, thank you to Marvel,[換行字元][換行字元]Plz don't spoil movie...[換行字元][換行字元]Go and watch...."
3956,"Thank you MARVEL studios for the 10 years of journey. The movie was brilliant and mind-blowing. 3 Hours felt like nothing. I only watch any movies once in the cinema, but this one, I wouldn't mind to watch it a couple more times. Will watch it again this weekend. The best movie I've ever watch in my whole life. Go and grab your tickets now, you wont regret it."
3957,The best movie in history of cinema So many emotions and feelings watching this masterpiece.speechless
3958,"An amazing, emotional experience. Being able to relive some of our most treasured memories over the past 10 years topped this off. I absolutely loved it ... more than 3000!!"
3959,"After watching Infinity War, i thought that was the masterpiece, they couldnt possibly go better. How wrong i was.[換行字元][換行字元]That bought you down low, they took you up high, made you laugh and shout and scream and then cry.[換行字元][換行字元]These brothers are genius.[換行字元][換行字元]There are some issues with the movie, some annoyances, but given how good the movie is as a whole, i ignored them. But a week later they are still niggling at the back of my mind, so i had to remove a star."
3960,"You think ""Infinity War"" was mind-blowing? So was I...but man...""Endgame"" is simply the best cinematic experience in my life and every fan since the beginning of the MCU can confirm it! I still got chills after this movie...it will haunt me for so long! You'll cheer, you'll laugh, you'll scream and also you'll cry...a lot.[換行字元][換行字元]Watching this building of characters since 2008 on big screen and watching the culmination of it is hearthbreaking and emotional![換行字元][換行字元]Also...they kept the script very well. 3 hours long movie and I needed more at the end![換行字元][換行字元]Thank you Kevin Feige, Russo Brothers and all the cast members and people behind the scenses, who made this thing real. This is life event![換行字元][換行字元]I can't wait to watch it again and again and again with my friends...and yeah I'll cry just like the first time, but man...worthed!"
3961,"First off, a great applause to the members (Director, Writers, Crews, Cast etc..) behind the extraordinary movie. Avengers Endgame is a terrific example of that epic intimacy that Marvel does so well - alternating between glorious action and subtle character moments. Watching it almost feels like taking a wistful walk down memory lane, flanked on either side by a Russo brothers, our hands held firmly in theirs. . It was a perfect ""ending"" of the 21 Movies.[換行字元][換行字元]The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. The best thing that happened in the movie was the heroic sacrifice. They captured the emotion perfectly. Favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it, you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath.[換行字元][換行字元]Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. The direction focuses more on the emotional side of the characters and story. While delivering an epic climatic showdown that will have you grasping and excited.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a great and awesome superhero film. It is one of the best finales that Joe and Anthony Russo have delivered. Thank you stan lee for making the superheroes ...."
3962,"Generic movie watchers may not be thrilled with this but people who are Dedicated MCU Fans , who know every Easter egg and each detail in all Avenger related MCU, they would have their minds blown away. It's a must-watch."
3963,"Definitely a perfect movie I was expecting for years, and on the first day I went and watched it was worth what I expected Thanks marvel thumbs up Iron Man!"
3964,"So, an era has ended. It began with Iron Man in 2008 and now the story of the Avengers has come to an end. There will be Marvel movies after this one. Spider-Man: Far from Home is coming out this very summer. But in a very real sense this is an end to that initial line-up. I even wonder if we're going to have Avengers 5.[換行字元][換行字元]The story picks up a few weeks after The Snap. Thanos has won and half of all living creatures in the universe have been dusted. Bleak times for everybody. But, after some hard times and setbacks, a new plan emerges. A bold plan. A crazy plan. A plan unlike any other.[換行字元][換行字元]The film works. It pays homage to the previous 21 films and the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. It finds a way to give respect to all the great things that have led us to this point, while still working as a standalone film. Not that you should see this film on its own. This is very much the culmination of a saga. It's not required to have seen all of MCU before seeing this one, but it sure does help. A lot.[換行字元][換行字元]Furthermore, it's much more fulfilling to watch this movie as a diehard Marvel fan. It's a very fanservicy film, full of reverences, callbacks and little cameos. It is an amazing film even without them, full of amazing action scenes, great character moments and mind-blowing special effects. But it truly shines as an ending. If you've seen all the previous films. If you've grown to love these characters. If you've invested yourself in this universe. Then it becomes something life-defining. It becomes a cornerstone. A feature of culture. Something that will be talked about for generations.[換行字元][換行字元]A very good film on its own. A great movie. But when you take into account the enormity of the MCU, it becomes something unlike anything else. I wonder if I will ever see a movie like this one in my lifetime. I hope so, but it is not a given. And that fact alone, that uniqueness, that scope, pays for all the praise imaginable.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you, Marvel. Here's to another decade of adventure."
3965,So as we know this is the last part of avengers series and for me after this no entertainment is left
3966,"Good movie, but the previous one was better.[換行字元][換行字元]It was enjoyable but not as exciting as the one before."
3967,"Does it entertain from beginning to end? Yes. Does it makes you laugh as much as it makes you cry? Yes. Is the acting top notch? Yes. Are the special effects, score and set-pieces the absolute best modern cinema has to offer? Yes. Is the script an absolute masterpiece that makes justice to every character in it? Yes. Is it the best movie ever made? Yes."
3968,Every marvel fan must watch this movie.Those who going for this movie without watching other movies they may get confused while watching this movie.Those who watched all marvel movies they can understand this movie.
3969,"NOTE: I've seen every film, and tv show in the MCU (a lot), so that's just to confirm that I'm not one of this reviewers that rip apart the film because they don't understand the importance or meaning behind it.[換行字元][換行字元]The first 2 hours are very slow, and what happens is predicatable at times which is the exact opposite of what I was expecting, it sometimes gets a bit boring, not to mention Fortnut in 5 years still being a thing![換行字元][換行字元]However, there are lots of fan pleasing moments in the first 2 hours and a few giggles which lightens the mood which was good, and I LOVE the way Steve was portrayed in this film, it was awesome. The sad moments were sad, and the fun moments were fun, they did their job.[換行字元][換行字元]The plot was very interesting in the fa t that we, as the ultra fans, were brought back in time on a nostalgic journey though our past memories of this amazing franchise. But sometimes the time travel aspect of it went a bit on, and kept on going when i thought we saw enough of it.[換行字元][換行字元]Then the final hour of the film comes in, and it was EPIC. Once again Cap was unbelievable, best part of the film by a mile, Tony was the same old Tony that we know and Love, and he was rightfully the one to end it all. However I didn't feel as saddend as I thought I would be about Tony at the end, I just felt glad that he was the one to end it, and the funeral at the end was not as AMAZING as I expected, as this was the most relevant character in the most relevant franchise of all time, and passed away. Having watch both seasons of Agent Carter I found Caps ending severely heartwarming.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, this film stayed off slow and average but eventually it was abosolutly stunning, but a few slightly disappointing little things near the end that don't really bother me.[換行字元][換行字元]I would say that Infinity War was better, as there was ZERO cons for me, and this has quite a few and Infinity War left me with no regrets in terms of directors' decisions.[換行字元][換行字元]2nd best MCU film imo, ABSOLUTELY STUNNING FILM[換行字元][換行字元]Also, when Doctor Strange released all the superhero's to fight, I was really hoping the guys from the tv-shows would be there amongst them all, that would be perfect."
3970,Make sure you carry tissues to the theatre...You will surely cry tears of grief and happiness
3971,"Endgame isn't just any regular super hero movie where ultimately the good guys defeat the bad guy. It's something entirely different. There's a Villain who's motive is really convincing andheroes who were defeated and are vulnerable. Ultimately it's not the triumph of good against the bad, it's the triumph of the greater good for all mankind. This is what that makes the movie unique. Russo brother's has done an outstanding job in bringing such a movie which is in a class on its own. Every single actors were excellent, but ultimately Chris Evans and Robert Downey Junior outshone every single person. Forget the negative criticism from peoples. This movie is a once in a generation event and must be seen from the theatre. Definitely it'll give you goosebumps."
3972,"This story-arc wrap-up starts with half the Avengers and world in general dead and no way to fix it. Only of course they figure out a way, because that was telegraphed in the last movie, and some of that goes right and some horribly wrong leading to, yet again, a massive battle.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is generally speaking as entertaining as the last one, although it's attempt to use it's time-travel conceit to include every single character from every cinematic marvel universe movie ever made can be wearying, with characters I don't quite remember, characters appearing too briefly to make an impact, and a tremendous number of non-speaking cameos that serve no purpose except to let the audience say, ""oh yeah, them.""[換行字元][換行字元]The first half is pretty zippy, with lots of banter and some flat-out slapstick. But the movie also wants to delve into the self-sacrifice theme, so the movie drifts into increasing levels of sorrow.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie ends, obviously, with a vast battle, and while it's quite good, with some serious ""wow"" moments, it is the smaller, character-driven moments that truly stand out, like two superheroes battling each other to be the one to self-sacrifice. And while the post-battle weep-fest seems a bit long, the film does end with a particularly satisfying resolution to one superhero's arc.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame gives you the solid, expected Avengers experience. Comedic, dramatic, special-effects driven, and overlong. It's well worth seeing even though ultimately it's nothing you haven't seen before."
3973,"Yes it worthed all that propaganda and anticipation, I enjoyed every minute of it , even if it would be 6 hours I will never get enough of such bunch of my favourite marvel superheroes. Sure I gonna see it several times again"
3974,You can't put a rat that saves the heroes and call it best movie
3975,"After watching the movie, it's just lowered my expectation, after watching the infinity war I was really expected how the avengers beat 'Thanos' , the first part of the movie I was really expected, it's great Thor cut the Thanos ' head off, after that I just felt bored at the first hour of the movie, just waste of time, second hour they're just simply talking about ' Time Machine ' named ' Time Heist ' how to go back to the past to change the past and bring the past characters to the present , how could that possible, well it's fine otherwise they cannot let the forms of life come back, including most of avengers like spider man, doctor strange, black panther, guardian of galaxy and others, no other way to get it back, it's creative to go back to the past and bring the past to the present ![換行字元][換行字元]The first suspicious part is how did the 2014 Nebula opened this ' Time Heist ' Gate let the thanos large ship go through the gate to the present seems super impossible for that, you have to wear a suit and need the red medicine for going back to the present, that's ridiculous.......[換行字元][換行字元]Second suspicious part how could the thanos become stronger without wearing the 6 stones glove , in infinity war thanos wasn't that strong even wearing that glove, seems it doesn't make sense for that, 'Captain Marvel' seems not super useful in the movie, she was the strongest in 'Captain Marvel 'movie , here she just destroyed the Thanos ship that's all........ supposed to kill Thanos right away..... just trying to stop flipping one finger , after that she was just hit to nowhere...... such a strongest hero in avengers, but here was just too terrible..... seems useless, the iron man 's passed away at the end makes me feel touching, he's a superhero, he took 6 stones from Thanos, and Flipped the fingers for Thanos let Thanos and his teams become dust and save the world! But was bit pitiful for 'Tony Stark ' for the character in Avengers! Natasha and Vision too ![換行字元][換行字元]Third suspicious is how could Captain America take Thor 's great hammer, super confused here, and Thor said: I just know..... the movie didn't mention how could Captain America could take the Thor Hammer ..... seems I missed a Marvel Movie.....[換行字元][換行字元]It's a great movie but suspicious parts made me lowered my expectation for the 'Endgame '!!! The 10 score guess just for the sponsors!!!"
3976,"I must next watched a different film to many on here but let's be honest this is the kind of film that attracts a lot of fanboys and /or rivals/trolls.[換行字元][換行字元]My opinion is not biased as I love and watch all superhero films ever since the original superman.[換行字元][換行字元]I just felt infinity war was a much better film that didn't mess around, we got into it straight away and the ending was unlike anything I've seen before in a comic based movie. Endgame didn't deliver on many fronts, things like captain marvel playing a big part felt like I was cheated or the whole plan by Dr strange was never fully explained. There were way too many jokes even for a marvel film and one of the strongest characters Thor was the butt of all jokes thought of the film till maybe the last 5 minutes during the big fight.[換行字元][換行字元]I think the movie reminded me of how I felt after watching matrix revolution... Just didn't live up to the hype sadly."
3977,I love it so muuuch! erveryone should watch this movie!
3978,"Just came back from my viewing and wow, what a bitter taste in my mouth. This 3 hour flick was supposed to be the biggest one yet and there was so little. The fun finally kicks in after 2 hours and 15 minutes. Everything before that was pretty boring. It's honestly not as ""amazing"" as people made it out to be. It was genuinely a one-and-done movie. Don't get me wrong I like some of the MCU movies, but I had a better time with Infinity War than with this installment. I don't think I could see myself paying for this movie again any time soon."
3979,"MCU have built up to this movie. 22 movies, endless battles, great heroes, enjoyable villains and now we are here. It was dark, it was funny, it was amazing. I enjoyed it very much but will need to watch it again as there was so much. Iron Man and Captain America got their Swan songs that they deserved as everyone knows the contracts are up. The plan worked!"
3980,"The Avengers: Endgame, i think this is the best movie ever"
3981,Just name is enough! Endgame is biggest blockbuster of the year.
3982,"No words needed, watch it 2 times in the first weekend, and still no words needed"
3983,This movie used the best effects to portrait the greatest ending.
3984,"Horrible, terrible, stupid. All the bad names you could call a movie should be directed at this one.[換行字元][換行字元]It's a pathetic excuse of a movie. It was cool having Guardians of the Galaxy in it, but even their humor and coolness was muted quite substantially.[換行字元][換行字元]Why am I still even writing about this..."
3985,The perfect ending to a series. I left the theater wanting it not to end even know it answered all questions and closed the series off.
3986,Comedy action pack and sad. Is a 3 hour movie so listen to Mark ruffalo. Bring tissues and diapers. Don't drink too much
3987,"I think Marvel films are fine, I understand loving them I really do. Spider-Man 2 is my personal favourite, but please stop giving these movies a 10/10. Endgame is a 7 at best. It's probably the most flawed Avengers film story wise. It's popcorn fun, but it's like if we let Fast & Furious or Transformers films in the top 250. Meanwhile 2001: A Space Oddisey is lower than Infinity War."
3988,Wont spoil the movie for the public worth watching once...
3989,Its sad to see it come to an end. But im satisfied by how it ended and how the story went through. With the usual expected sense of humor in marvels movies and a good story line.
3990,Not one time did the scene after a scene make sense or have anything to do with the previous scene. I know this was a kids movie really but wow. I wish luck to all that come after me. The future is not bright. Maybe one of you can stop this. I feel like I watched 4 different movies all just settiny up movies to suck more moneu from my wallet but im done. Chris Pratts likeability will no longer fool me into beliveing this film series has a heart. It does not. It is evil personified. Hollywoods sins on a silver platter. Hope you have hot sauce to choke down this garbage.
3991,Absolute perfection showing that even superheroes suffer the same as regular people and help showcasing depression and coping with loss with action and humour all mixed in to 3 hrs that just flew by. The perfect end to a perfect saga
3992,"A culmination of character arcs, narrative threads, a decade of cinema history, and like so many films in the MCU before, the guiding theme boils down to this: ""Everyone fails at who they are supposed to be; the measure of a person, a hero, is how they succeed at being who they are."" No doubt, I have my quibbles---""I amâ¦an Avenger"" would have kept something of the parallelism, but with a deeper sense of growth and better ethics---and some confusion, but at just over three hours long while carrying the weight of so many franchises, that is to be expected. At bottom, having already invested so many hours and years into these characters and these films, these stars and these stories, the mark of success is the emotional resonance and historic importance pushing the possibility of the medium (and its economic footing) forward, not the cinematic flourishes or compelling performances or memorable quips---that the film has a few of those, too, is merely a bonus."
3993,"Pure emotions went through while watching this movie. I cried I laughed, I cried again and then I laughed and this was the perfect end to a Saga of superheroes who made our childhood awesome! Thanks to Russo Brothers for this awesome and unbelievable direction, Avengers Cast for bringing their best at the right time and of course not to forget STAN LEE❤"
3994,"This movie is only really good if you've seen all or most of the movies that led up to it (i.e. From Iron Man, Captain America, the first Avengers Movie, up to Infinity War), but is still a good one if you've seen less or not much of the previous ones.[換行字元][換行字元]Part of the story is the buildup, which leads to the anticipation of the conclusion. The MCU has tried its best to do just that, and it was done in grand fashion. The twists that comes with this film is executed very well, tying it up with the events of the previous avengers, and a quest to avenge those who have fallen brought forth an epic search, battle, and a sad and heartwarming, yet victorious, conclusion.[換行字元][換行字元]Animations are of course excellent, as well as the actors for the cast of Avengers. They've put their heart in a franchise that led to a blossoming friendship off and on the screen, which made the cohesiveness and chemistry of this cast really stand out in the film.[換行字元][換行字元]There's no reason not to see one of the biggest films of the decade. Iif you truly want to enjoy it at its fullest, watch the films in the MCU that led up to the Endgame."
3995,Nothing can come out of my mouth to describe the feeling after watching this film. Here's a glimpse of it: my Apple Watch keeps reminding me that my heart rate has gone through the roof. I could have died!
3996,"When you see the movie, you may feel like lets give 10/10 for it. But when you come back home and think it may not be worth it. A good film is which follows you even when you are out of theater. Issues with the film 1) pace of the film. This is the most slow paced film in the series I guess. Easily this could be ended in 2:30 hrs or little more action would have been better 2)plot holes: plot holes in some films, we tend to ignore because we are carried away by the whole scene/movie. But in this, some questions keep on hitting us even inside theater.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall I like the movie. It is watchable of course. And the way main story is developed is good. Most of us won't expect the way it unwinds. And the way they treat Thor and Hulk will be unbearable for their hardcore fans/comic book fans. Since I am a captain fan, I find it awesome for his scenes."
3997,"Seemed like 20 minutes of action at the most out of 3 hours. The film didnt need to be that long. The scenes that were meant to be emotional were executed poorly, didnt make me feel anything other than boredom. Seems all the 10 star ratings are just from marvel fans! Face it guys, it is a bad film. The previous avengers was 1000x better. The whole length of infinity war was about them defeating thanos, in this film it took them 20 minutes."
3998,"I'm as happy as I can get having watched this masterpiece of a superhero movie! Even though it's sad and heart-breaking at some points, the overall feeling it leaves you with is pure awe and wanting for more. The sadness is well-deserved for some beloved characters but it's all done logically and in a noble way.[換行字元][換行字元]The audience and I laughed a good deal throughout the movie (just like it was with Ragnarok), and 3 hours passed in an instant, I didn't get bored and didn't feel tired at the end. However I am speechless at the grandeur and scale of this finale.[換行字元][換行字元]I have nothing else to say here (or have I?) except for: I envy all of you who is yet to enjoy all the twists and turns of this beautiful movie for the very first time!:)[換行字元][換行字元]What are you still waiting for?! Go watch it! Now!"
3999,Movie had entirely too many plot holes there were inconsistencies throughout the movie the action scenes were good the drama was good but basically you got to see three main characters let's be honest we all went to see a lot of our favorites and certain characters had one line maybe two
4000,"I have never wrote a review about any movie I watch. I just feel that I have to document what just touched my heart. Growing up in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi Arabia, without cinema was hard for me. I remember I used to wait months after the movie comes out to watch it online. When I was in college, I used to travel to Bahrain to watch Marvel movies. I enjoyed watching all the movies. I have developed a strong connection with all the characters. I feel what they feel, I understand what they understand. It became a part of my life. My friends, even my close friends, used to make fun of me for watching superheroes movies. They always say that there is no story it is all CGI, what are you watching it for? They do not understand the creativity of developing characters and flashbacks, let alone understanding a complex plot with many planets and universes. I am so happy that I made it to the U.S and watched the movie in the opening day. With that said, Avengers: Endgame is one of the most epic movies I have ever seen. I laughed too loud, cried too hard, and smiled a lot. I will not write any spoilers, I am not that guy, but I wanted to share some of the feelings that I experienced in these epic three hours. The movie has everything perfect the writing, acting, and directing are all outstanding. If there is one wish that I could have in life is that watching this movie with someone I love who have the same admiration for Marvel movies. To the creators, actors and actresses, people behind the scene, and everyone participated in creating it I cannot thank you enough for what you have done. I know this is not a perfect review but I had to share it somehow."
4001,Movie is good rollercoaster ride of emotions and the writer and director duo has done splendid job in bringing the epic to the film
4002,"... and what let down! Slow to develop and fast and furious action in the end. The whole story line was awful and the ending pretty much may have been the ""endgame"" for me, in watching it any further. You may have to watch it to understand the future development - with new heros and old ones gone - but this has now become more of a ""transformer"" type kid series. So bye, bye for me."
4003,One of the greatest movie of this century. 11 years worth treasure.
4004,"Wow, that's the word I want to start with so there will be no confusion about this movie. It's almost brilliant, to get us hyped for a movie after years of building and to deliver. Amazing. The perfect mix of humor, drama, action and suspense, the perfect cast and the brilliant story writing makes this movie the best of all the superhero movies ever made. And it was enough for now. I came to love all the characters and even the less popular ones got great respect. It was a Rollercoaster ride, a thrill with a family like saus that made this 36 Yr old guy cry like a 12 Yr old kid. There was one moment of criticism for me personally and that was the political correct women are strong message that this movie did not need. Not one moment I had the feeling that women or men where more or less important and needed a moral boost but even That didn't ruin the moment and man, that moment was glorious."
4005,"Avengers: Endgame is absolutely amazing, it's literally a perfect conclusion of these MCU movies from the past 11 years. This movie is a roller coaster ride, it's truly epic, funny and emotional. This movie will totaly blow your mind, you never seen anything like this before. This movie will go down in history as one of the best movies of all time and the best superhero movie of all time."
4006,"It's a great movie. Didn't feel like 3 hours of film. It was so good, I didn't want it to end. Wish there was more. Overall I believe marvel did a great job."
4007,"You know how in Jr. High your teacher used to make you watch Schindlers List. Well, for our kids, they'll make them watch End Game! It was that epic!!! Okay so maybe I went a little overboard there to exaggerate my point. But, if you love Marvel, you'll love this!!!"
4008,Awesome 💙💙 I've been enjoying whole the movie 💚
4009,Great movie full of surprising and amazing moments. Thanks for MARVEL and Russo brothers for this amazing work.
4010,I don't know what I'm feeling after I finished the movie should i cry or being happy or what!!
4011,"The movie is entertaining and time will fly faster than expected as you're in it. On any standard I do recommend the movie if not for anything else, but for it's entertainment value. I do believe the hype that is going on around the movie will be letting some people down.[換行字元][換行字元]I'm in between giving it a 6 or 7 because of the well executed entertainment value it provides. I will have to round it down to 6 because of the amount of 10's this movie is getting at the moment. The movie neither blows your brains with plot twists or anything like that.[換行字元][換行字元]Comparing this purely to other superhero movies I'd give this one a 9-. I think Infinity Wars was better, but this concludes the Avenger series perfectly."
4012,I don't have the words to describe how perfect this film is. Emotional and all in all the best way to end the infinity saga
4013,"The movie seems to be dragged. If you're going in with an expectation that it will contain lots of action, you'll be disappointed. Few major characters have been watered down in significance as well. Overall decent movie, but won't watch it again. If you're going in with an expectation of ""Dark Knight, Interstellar, Inception, Logan"" level movie, then don't. You'll end up disappointed."
4014,"If you thought Marvel couldn't top themselves after Infinity War, you're in for a huge surprise.

4015,"If you have even just a passing interest in superhero/sci-fi/fantasy films, then there is absolutely no excuse for not seeing this film. If you go, ""well superhero films are for kids/nerds/menchildren"" then poor old you, you'll miss out on what is, my humble opinion, one of the greatest fantasy films I've ever seen. Endgame is perfect. It ties up up all the loose ends from the last ten years of Marvel films and leaves nothing, NOTHING, unfinished or left untouched. There are moments, huge moments, that leave you breathless, hopeless and high as a kite. 10 years of slow burn and build up and then bam... This is how you do superhero ensemble films. You build up slowly, you take your time and once you're ready, you make a film that is the sum of all its parts. Marvel has made some truly epic superhero films, the pressure has always been to make film that brings it all together and does it justice. DC/Warner failed abysmally with Justice League, a film that should blown us away but instead just blew up. Endgame does absolute justice to ten years of intricate planning and forward thinking. It takes you on a thrill ride that takes 3 hours and makes it seem like 30 minutes. Oh, and see it at a cinema first, you have to see it at the cinema. It's just too good to see it on anything else first..."
4016,A truly emotional roller coaster for any Marvel fan

4022,"This is a spoiler free review. But i don't know if you can call it that. I never write reviews. I just wanted to share some thoughts.[換行字元][換行字元]First things first. This movie is the conclusion to 11 years of the MCU. There are jokes, action, strong emotions etc. It's a great movie overall. But make no mistake. This is not a standalone movie and thus should not be judged as that. Infinity War and Endgame are practically one movie. Both can stand well as standalone movies but they truly shine as one. Before we knew the titles, they were referred to as Infinity War, Part1 and Part2.[換行字元][換行字元]Now, I might be biased. Who knows. But i've been a fan of the MCU since 2008 with Iron Man. I was only 9 back then and I was absolutely fascinated by the movie. Now, 11 years later, being 20 years old i can honestly say it was all worth it. I've watched every movie in the MCU, no exceptions. Obviously, some i did not like. But they were all tied up together nicely. In Infinity War & Endgame, almost every character that was brought to the screen in the MCU makes an appearance.[換行字元][換行字元]As i said, i am talking about the 2 movies as one. The action is great and it's all meaningful thanks to a great villain in Thanos, that actually has motives instead of mindlessly wanting to destroy or rule the world. The heroes we all loved make a stand against him, a final stand at that. Everything is surrounding the Infinity Stones, which obviously play a huge part in the whole MCU, thus far at least. The acting is good and the CGI are superb. The story telling of the two movies is fantastic, makes you sad and emotional, then makes you laugh and then it takes all of it away and breaks you in so many levels. And the emotions are very consistent.[換行字元][換行字元]Since this is a spoiler free ""review"" i cannot say much else because this movie deserves to be viewed spoiler-free at all costs.[換行字元][換行字元]All i have to say is, go watch it!

There are no words to describe how this movie embraces everything you learned to love for the past 11 years....Action, Gags, Team-ups, Payback, Cameos, Easter Eggs, it has it all!!!

4042,"This movie was set up brilliantly by infinity war. The suspense the ending and the direction was all up to the mark. The cast delivers perfectly. Some of the theories used in the movie create plot holes which are well taken care of. Some of the parts of the movie is not well explained. It is a lot to grasp at the first watch. I thought that Robert Downey Jr performed brilliantly. The movie clocks well over 3 hours, but in the end keeps you wanting more. It opens up a wide future for the MCU to take shape into. It lives up to the hype. I felt that some of the cast members deserved more screen time. Otherwise you can put it up well with the best superhero movies of all time. If not the best."
4043,"I am totally blown away! The whole summer I sat and watched through the whole MCU and was so hyped for Endgame. It didn't disappoint. I love how great the balance between action and emotional character scenes was. And the character development! I don't understand why everyone criticize Hawkeyes development, cuz it was great. I love how he has gone from a totally boring action character in avengers 1 to a character you cared about. He made me cry so many times. That's a point too. I cried so much, and I have a hard time crying when I watch movies. And the time travel aspect that got so much critic. I love how they actually made a great thing about the quantum realm. When I watched Ant-man I thought about this, and finally! And the ending of Captain America... I have literally not cried so much in my whole life. What a great ending to one of the greatest humans of history! It's just one thing though, you have to be a marvel and watch the whole mcu before to understand. But I'm a marvel nerd, so I'm pleased! Go watch it right now, and prepare to become emotional and lose your whole supply off tears!"

Yeah, there are some little nitpicks here/there, but honestly, not enough for me to not call it the perfect conclusion of the 21 movies leading up to it. Rest up, bring tissues, and wear a diaper (as Ruffalo instructed so you don't have to leave to pee, lol). Go watch and just enjoy. <3"

The cgi is top notch and the character arcs are really good. i thought infinity war was amazing but damn this movie is on a whole nother level just 3 hours of amazing action,cgi,and storytelling.

I know some people prefer other genres because superhero movies plot usually suck but I'm still a teenager and for me this is the best film i ever watched."

4051,"The film is very beautiful with great visual effects. The story is wonderful and enjoyable. Despite the duration of the film, which lasted 3 hours, the enthusiasm made me feel time go faster . The comic side was very good. I really want to thank the directors for this masterpiece and I look forward to the future of Marvel films."
4052,This movie is unarguably one of the best movies of all time.
4053,The perfect way to say goodbye to characters that have been with us for so many years.
4054,"Gave it an extra star because the ending was a fitting finale. If you haven't seen this at a movie theatre, then just wait for it to come to Netflix or whatever streaming service Disney will release. I was in the theatre for close to 4 hours and it's just not worth it."
4055,"Of all 21, this one was a tear jerker. I couldn't keep my tears in my eyes. What I call the first part of the movie was a bit slow, but it picked up for sure. I loved the way they brought back familiar characters from previous movies. They did an excellent job bringing back those individuals we thought we'd never see again. The ending fight was just the best, it was awesome, words can't explain. Just see it!!"

So beautiful, so much grandeur, so much power and passion that it pulls at your heartstrings. I'll talk about only the basic things here- CGI - woah man! Those were dope! I suggest you watch the movie in the biggest screen you can find. Action - They were absolutely grand. This movie has now my favorite action scene from any MCU movie. Story - very dramatic and very powerful. It kind of expands upon all the previous MCU films, so I advice you watch all the movies beforehand. Direction - the Russo brothers as usual did a perfect job of directing this monumental epic. Acting - In general the entire cast a did great, great job. The entire cast delivered the top performance of their respective characters till date. The actors who completely stood out were RDJ, Evans and ScaJo. They were phenomenal![換行字元][換行字元]This is not only my favorite my MCU movie but one of my favorite movies EVER. Go see it ASAP. You'll laugh, cheer, put your hands in the air and cry.

4064,"Personally I found it a bit disappointing. Took to long to get the action going in my opinion. You could of took some of the first hour out as dragged a bit. I was expecting great things with this movie, but was let down after infinity wars. Now that's a good film and this is not. Hey not everyone will agree as we all have our own thoughts about what we expect or want to expect in a movie. Also I personally like Hawkeye so people should leave him alone,"
4065,"The movie has it all, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you feel apprehensive, tense. Simply incredible. Best service fan of the universe."
4066,"After 21 films worth of waiting, Marvel has finally reached the conclusion to the Infinity Saga in Avengers: Endgame. The collective movies had mad billions of dollars, and captured the hearts of comic book fans around the world. The prior entry, Avengers: Infinity War added a certain sense of gravitas and catharsis to the Marvel Universe. The prior film left fans not only devastated, but with more questions than answers with it's cliffhanger, serial ending. So how does the conclusion fare? Are the Fallen avenged? Is Endgame worth the hype?[換行字元][換行字元]One of my greatest praises of Shazam! was the amount of personal consequence it had. One of my biggest criticisms of most superhero movies is that the consequence is constantly about saving the world. This then makes saving the world a redundant outcome that we know the superheroes will eventually solve. With constant resurrections and story revisions, the Marvel Universe greatly lacked this. Yet even though the world saving was still the primary conflict of Endgame, the story contained personal consequence for each individual character that made the film far more endearing to the viewer. This filled the film with incredibly written, visceral moments of joy, pain, and everything in between.[換行字元][換行字元]The amount of story-boarding that went into the film is insane. The run time is long, but a necessary evil to the human bladder to tie up so many loose ends within an incredibly convoluted plot. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has so many characters, and Endgame gives resolution to their individual strife, while raising questions that can be pursued in future films. It gives each character their own space in the spotlight while concurrently sharing it equally. It is absolute brilliant direction by the Russo brothers.[換行字元][換行字元]I cannot justifiably call Endgame the singular greatest superhero film of all time. Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy is still brilliant, and did not need 21 films of buildup. Yet it absolutely rivals the trilogy with the first Marvel film that takes a chance with the ultimate pathos. The film rewards the fans who have seen all of the films, even the poorer entries, while inviting new fans with instant accessibility. I never checked my watch, I never felt the need to get up from my seat, which is something that has never occurred for me within a three hour movie. Not every direction choice worked as intended, not every story point was logistically flawless, but it still works. I laughed, I cried, and sometimes even did bof. Not both, but BOF. I can't give Avengers:Endgame any grade worse than perfect.[換行字元][換行字元](Grade: 10/10)"

As someone who was never a fan of comics growing up, and only saw the first Iron Man movie as part of a work function, I have come to await every installment eagerly and this one most of all.

There is the reason this movie got so much hype, and that is because we connected with every character in it. It doesent matter if some characters didn't get much screen time in end game, because we had our time to watch them, get to know them and their stories. I won't talk about CGI and other stuff, thats personal preferences, but let me just say, amount of effort to get this resoult is aomething you won't bee seeing in short time. Best MOVIE FRANCHISE EVER for me, gets 10/10"
4086,This was the PERFECT ending for the Avengers arc. Exceeded all my expectations. This movie has revolutionized the Marvel and superhero movie business!
4087,"This movie was so overhyped so it hurt the review but it's a better then average movie. The beginning is slow which is fine cause it usually creates tenseness; however, the movies pacing jumps along to going fast and then back to slow. It's pacing is bad and vary irritating. There were many unexplained plot holes too. Usually this is fine but the audience needs details especially in a lore as deep as marvels. There was too much emotion and it didn't have to end the way it did. Still is a must see and a good film, just not the conclusion we needed."
4088,"I laughed, I cried, this is perfection... I'm still totally stunned!"
4089,"Writing a review on this movie is a walking by minefield but I should. So, Avengers Endgame is the ending of more than twenty pictures which covered ten years of history. Moreover, it's sequel of Avengers Infinity War. For all that time we've seen a lot of characters and it's impossible to give them well-balanced screentime. Because of it as main characters we have leftovers of Avengers in team. They survived after Thanos Click. But don't worry. You'll see all characters of MCU. Even Valkiria, even Hank Pim. Avengers Endgame screenplay plays with a very dangerous kinda stuff - timetravelling. And, worth recognize that all lines of screenplay are ended. Big respect to all scenario team. For a three hours u'll see everything what u like in MCU - balance between jokes and serious speeches (which snatched from all ancient greek tragedies), balance between character powers and influence of it on epic points of movie. And, for sure, balance between fan-service and common sense. So, all like Thanos said. Perfect balance. Few words about Thanos too. Like main evil of MCU, he sucks. But wait. There are Thor in his best form and best epic battle since Lord of The Rings! Bad motivation is covered by these two factors. You don't need to think about logic or physics in this movie. If you are just like me watching MCU movies since 2008 - this movie is for you. Be prepared to crying like a baby because of all kinds of fan service. Does this circus have a meaning? Of course! Creators having fun, Tony Stark jokes, Captain America watches on everything with most serious view, Black Widow spells more than ten words for all movie. Everything is usually. Thanks to Marvel Studios for these ten years. I'll wait for next movies in MCU."
4090,"Apart from some cheesy moments, some of them fan pleasing, it was really good. I think it was a solid 10-year wrap up conclusion, so they could start something new (with the new characters Marvel now owns back).[換行字元][換行字元]Good humour, comic-like story sequence, paying homage to almost all the old arcs of the heroes tribiting departed and survivors.[換行字元][換行字元]Way to many cameos, it was a festival for Marvel. Some of them they did not have a line. They did not need to, to be honest.[換行字元][換行字元]All the Infinity war surviving characters were well treated through the whole movie and some of them had satisfying climax and conclusioj to their stories. For some futire is still with many stories to be told.[換行字元][換行字元]The actions of act 2 were a bit troubling about the story and the consequences of the future MCU. The visuals were spectacular, especially in the 3rd act.[換行字元][換行字元]Compare to Infinity war which was a base story with many concrete plot points, Endgame got his power from IW but went to a way bigger direction, some of it unnecessarily.[換行字元][換行字元]The most ""it's a no from me"" scene was the very poorly and stupidly ""girl power superleague"" moment.[換行字元][換行字元]Thor was the comic relief character, in many ways.[換行字元][換行字元]The aftermath of 'Avengers Endgame' is a bittersweet sensation, eager for more stories."
4091,"The first half of the movie have some slow and boring scenes, not an end game type movie, missing action and the power start, the second half and the last 40 minutes marvels best, can watch multiple times only for thanos"
4092,"It's just a masterpiece, everything is looking pretty good!"
4093,"This movie is an experience that you feel like is the one of your life. Some questions from last movie are answered, new clues. Just amazing."
4094,What a way to finish this story. Absolute perfection... Loved it. If you have been invested in the MCU for 10 years and this movie had no effect on you emotionally? Seek help... Genuinely.[換行字元][換行字元]Take a bow Russo Brothers 👌👍👏👏👏
4095,"This I had to see...[換行字元][換行字元]But oh well, must be all those die-hard Marvel fanboys at it again.[換行字元][換行字元]Lot's of CGI, green screen and jokes in this SOAP OPERA with way too many characters. And yes, here comes the CGI villain again.[換行字元][換行字元]It wasn't for me.[換行字元][換行字元]Captain America: Winter Soldier is still the best Marvel movie."
4096,"It NOT a great end of 10 years MCU franchise. Several details were questionable and they could've handled those many characters better. It didn't meet my high expectations. However, the movie has some heartfelt moments and was fairly good conclusion."
4097,This movie had a lot to live up to and for the most part it does.
4098,"Never in my life have I left a review on here however I felt obligated to after sitting through three hours of absolute nonsense. The film began an I was just at a loss for words, it felt like a practical joke. However I held out hope that it would get better, it didn't, it got worse. The way some of these beloved characters have been portrayed in this film literally made my toes curl up in embarrassment, it's absolutely shocking. Lazy writing, and beyond anti climactic. I've seen so many 10/10 reviews on here I'm half convinced the film I seen was actually a joke and all these other people got to see a completely different film than I did. I had so much hope for the Russo Brothers to make this a truly spectacular film and I didn't think it would be possible for them to mess up this bad. I had tickets to go and see it a second time later on today however I'd rather lose the money and not go than sit through it again. So dissappointed."
4099,"This movie blew me away. It kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was slow where it needed to be and fast where it needed to be. I am glad they decided to keep the run time at 3 hours, it needed it. And on run time, it flew by. There was a fair big chunk of the movie that was ""slowish"" but I do not say that in a negative way. With how infinity war left off, it had to be. The story was so good and wrapped up nicely. It was respectful to the characters and I am happy where they all ended up, as hard as it was to watch, it was still satisfying. I would be completely satisfied if this was the end of the MCU altogether, it was just so tastefully done. I need to see this again!"
4100,A true film geared towards fans made by fans this movie is good conclusion to many childhoods and a very amazing conclusion for 11 years of marvel truly spectacular.
4101,"After watching Infinity War, the bar was set super high. I was scared that Endgame couldn't reach the same level, but it went even higher. Love it times 3000."
4102,"So I had to create a word, TerrEpicullous. It bring closure while raising new questions. It's the justice all the fans needed and deserved. I hope they teach these phases in schools."
4103,"Honestly you can't just mention the word franchise without thinking how the MCU started back in 2008 with Iron Man , and made it here to the Endgame . Exactly 22 movies full of details that were merged in the last movie of the infinity saga . As a movie fanatic , this was my favorite byfar , with little flaws that were turned into dust in comparison to the greatness this movie produced ."
4104,"Phewwww...what a journey right? 22 films wrapped up in one movie, one epic and satisfying conclusion. If you think Infinity War was crazy, watch this and you'll be ""oh boy am I wrong"". This movie is something. This movie will make you feel like dying. My experience was, 3 hours didn't feel like a long time. 3 hours and I still want more! It was funny, thrilling, unexpected, fresh and most of all...emotional. You'll definitely need to bring tissues because I guarantee you will definitely cry. More than once. Prepare yourself. And before watching this, I suggest you to watch the past movies first to really get this movie and if you don't have time, at least go with someone who really understand everything so that you won't be left out. In conclusion, I really really enjoyed this movie. Definitely want to watch this again in the future. Thank you MCU, thank you to all of the amazing casts, thank you Russo Brothers, thank you stan lee (RIP), thank you all."
4105,"I've waited a whole year for this. Actually, it's more like 11 years. Look, I'm a self-professed fanboy who grew up reading comic books as a kid. I absolutely LOVE how Kevin Feige, the actors and the whole Marvel/Disney company have been able to bring some of my childhood heroes to life. When they first released the Ironman trailer, I was overjoyed because the Ironman flying sequences looked AWESOME & RDJ WAS Tony Stark personified. Then the absolute childish joy of Samuel L Jackson's the Ultimates Nick Fury post credits - Boom! I dared to dream they would go all out with other heroes, and team-ups and cross-overs - the whole nine yards. And they did. The sheer scope of coordinating such a huge undertaking; the various directorial visions while maintaining a common thread; the writers talents to compress dialogue to it's shortest version while still making sense and actors to deliver those lines believably. The artistry of all those thousands of top level professionals blows me away. In a way, I'm glad it's over. I've turned the last page, and I'm satisfied. I have closure. If you've been along for the whole ride, or just a part, you owe it to yourself too."
4106,"Amazing. Absolutely amazing and heartbreaking. Triumphant. Breathtaking. And soul crushing. Someone asked me what I thought of Endgame...and all I could respond with was, there are so many words! There are so many reasons why this was the perfect superhero movie...I wouldn't have time to name them all. Do I have my gripes? Yes. I do. Maybe it's because I still haven't seen all the MCU movies that led up to this one. Or. Maybe it's because I was sitting in the front row on the right side, so I had to look at the screen as though I were watching a tennis match. Back and forth and back and forth. Whatever the case, I was in complete shock. And I laughed so hard I cried a bit. I smiled nonstop. I was so taken aback that I gasped, held my breath while covering my mouth for extended periods of time. My heart was broken multiple times to where I ugly cried uncontrollably. Even now, hours after watching the movie, I feel so destroyed by certain moments that my eyes weld with tears just thinking of those scenes. I cheers for the men who did the damn thing. I cheered for the women who banded together and rocked. I cheered for the black characters that many thought shouldn't be or shouldn't have made it. I cheered for Captain America. He was always worthy. I respect the Black Widow. I cheered for love. And second chances. This movie gave us everything we needed and more. I will watching it a million times over because every now and again, I'll need reminding that someone out there loves me 3,000."
4107,This not an ordinary movie it is work of 11 years and 21 films to get there. Every moment is perfect such a great work I can't imagine the effort that marvel do to produce the perfect cinematic universe I have ever seen. I won't talk about the movie to avoid spoilers but there is at least three or four moment to touch you and making you cry and two or three moment to just stands wherever you are and clap. I can tell it easy that is the best superhero movie I have ever seen (no one talk about dark knight in my opinion it is not a superhero movie)
4108,"This movie was a huge disappointment after the last one. Way too long, no character development, and a foregone conclusion. I'd say skip it but if you're an avengers fan, you have to see the ending. In that case, wait for video and don't expect much and you'll be fine."
4109,"I can't even imagine a better way to end the incredible multitude of movies the MCU has produced to this point. Not only do they potentially conclude this story for the OG Avengers; they actually set up so many other stories to come! Each character has their own conclusion, and showing that in detail is what the makers of this movie did the best. Being such a huge fan of these movies since the beginning has been an unbelievable ride, and I am so impressed at the utter magnificence of the way they concluded together as one. The fact that I went into this movie with such high expectations, and it surpassed those expectations, shows how insane this movie really is. Everyone needs to watch this movie and truly appreciate the magnitude of what the MCU has pulled off. I can't wait to see what's next, but I also don't expect anything to ever come close to this."
4110,Pretty good but I wished for more. More movies with just one super hero
4111,"The best movie I 've seen, so far, in my life. It was a twist and you didn' t see that one coming. What a movie!!! From laughing to crying, it's a movie that gives you all the emotions in one hand."
4112,"Ten years the MCU has been with us, and through all these years I've been watching their films and grading them like a teacher grades homework. Sometimes too harshly maybe. Today I'll be at my most benevolent, so the rating might be somewhat biased.[換行字元][換行字元]Let's be honest. All the previous MCU movies, except the Captain America ones, were inherently flawed (as Thanos would've said, those flaws were ""inevitable""). Not because of the writing or the visuals, but because of the heroes' nature. Only Steve Rogers was both mature and complete from within, so his story was always solid and compelling on all levels. All the other ""heroes"" were more or less kids in powersuits, fighting their own childhood traumas or searching for their purpose. And, as much as I love the coming-of-age movies, a certain annoying goofiness is always their prominent part.[換行字元][換行字元]But not today. Thanos' Snap didn't just remove a half of the universe's population - it forced everyone to re-evaluate their whole modi operandi. When so many people just... vanish all of a sudden, you just can't stay the same, especially if you feel like it's in a way your fault.[換行字元][換行字元]And this turn has given us the first hour of this film, maybe the deepest and the most sincere hour in the history of the superhero genre. The post-apocalyptic fright isn't anything new, but this time it's not about the actual survival, but rather trying to accept the new reality, in which, by some lucky coincidence, you were... allowed to live, while some people hadn't been.[換行字元][換行字元]This, and the whole grandeur of the culmination, are the things that mark out Endgame as a masterpiece of its kind, which deserves to be remembered. The rest is a pretty typical Marvel'esque stuff, lots of pathos and bright CGI effects. Towards the end the movie becomes almost too sentimental, but I guess I would be too, if that universe became my second family for ten years.[換行字元][換行字元]One more thing. I've been a part of the Team Cap since his first film, and I rooted for his side in Civil War. But this time Steve Rogers and Tony Stark managed to play it together and create a duo that truly shines. I guess when a story that big comes to an end, everyone has a chance to be a hero without overshadowing anyone else."
4113,"I couldn't predict most of the scenes the ending was totally unpredictable, a lot of comedy, action, thrill and most of all the perfect ending. (hail marvel)"
4114,A great conclusion to the avengers movies. One of marvels best
4115,I don't know what should I say.. Time travel in this movie has problem. But this is the best quality of this film
4116,"The time MCU spent crafting it's heroes and their backstories, they could've invested some of that time in making a decent villain...thanks is laughable, with no ""essence"" of a villain...you don't feel his presence when he is in a frame...and that diminishes the value of a villain quite largely...the superheroes fear stones more than the villain...and last time I checked you need a good villain for a decent superhero movie...I don't understand why people are showering such perfect reviews on this movie.. seriously 😥...yeah and the time travel hogwash eats up a good chunk of movie which deprives us of all the little moments that worked great in infinity war"
4117,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, it was 11 years of my childhood rolled up into one movie. It was funny, sad, thrilling, and exciting. Sure it was slow at first but I enjoyed it, so for this movie I give 10 stars"
4118,I feel like trembling when the final war were about to happen. Epic
4119,"No words. Is my first Avenger movie which I see but the last, because ""End Game"" word is real. It's amazing, 3 hours amazing. Respect Marvel for giving me the best movie in my life."
4120,The best marvel movie to ever be created. The movie is visually stunning and the story will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more and more. This movie will leave you in shock and tears.
4121,"This is for the MCU fans, a truly heartfelt, emotional 3 hour journey into characters we have grown to love over the last 11 years. It's not perfect, they took huge risks, some I didn't like, others I loved! A Few things to know: It's light on action (until the last hour) In favour of telling a slower story and letting the characters simmer in a scene. Take tissues Don't take a toilet break There are no after credit scenes. Overall I loved this movie. It's a fantastic and satisfying conclusion. 9/10 Where I rank this in the 4 Avengers movies - 1st Where I rank this in the MCU - 2nd"
4122,"Avengers Endgame. This was the first time I've seen one of these blockbusters in a cinema and the difference - with the latest digital sound and vision - is remarkable. As I watched the unfolding of this three hour of whizz bangs groans and creaks and blasts I was reminded of A S Byatt, which rather surprised me. Ragnarok of course, but it was the underlying Powysian magic of Byatt that led me to seeing something of Wagner, too. I know this sounds pretentious but I am merely giving my thoughts an hour or so after seeing this in the cinema.This is epic and grand mythmaking, and the film thrilled me more than I can say. As a fan of myths, opera, SF and wild fantasy it poured into my head with relentless pleasure."
4123,"It's really impressive how this movie pulls events and storylines from Marvel movies from 2012 onwards. That is epic storytelling for sure. Congrats to the writers and Marvel for integrating all the assets in their universe so well.[換行字元][換行字元]But was it well done? Generally, I'd say ""yes"". I think having so many characters involved watered down the movie's intensity and impact. But still, it's an amazing movie for the scope, scale and visuals that were achieved.[換行字元][換行字元]If you get a chance to see it in 3D, do it. Some good effort was spent in making the 3D version extra spectacular and immersive. Either way, if you enjoy Marvel movies, this one's not to be missed."
4124,This movie has been highly anticipated. I prepared for it. Saw all the MCU MOVIES and took a friend along who is even nerdier than I am. A masterpiece work of art by the Russo Brothers and truly worth every second of it
4125,An Overrated movie because of marvel fans. Only last 1 hour was good .
4126,Too many plot holes and scenarios that don't line up with what was put in place in the previous MCU movies. Massive let down for the entire story arc. Best to have the MCU movies end with Infinity Wars.
4127,This movie is worth every penny.Go see it . you'll feet 11 years of movies making sense .
4128,Ranged from merely ok to messy and contrived. Disappointed they resorted to a time travel movie (was that the best they could come up with??). Hated what they did to Hulk and Thor. Hawkeye was irritating and Captain Marvel was hyped up for basically nothing... Infinity War was far far better.
4129,You have to watch this movie. It's just too perfect to be an ending for The Avengers.
4130,"Just go watch it! It is worthy! Captain America, Thor, Everyone!!! And Tony.. omg.. 😃 best movie made by Marvel!"
4131,"A masterful epic - a true culmination of 22 films that not only concludes the story, but expands upon it. You'll learn more about the other movies while this one unfolds. If Infinity War is the brawn, Endgame is the brains. And wow, what an ending!"
4132,Just perfect! Cannot believe they pulled off the biggest movie in cinematic history this spectacularly!
4133,I can't find the right word but it's huge monstrous epic conclusion movie with lots of details. Russo Bro's done it once again. & fully satisfied
4134,"A huge task to simply wrap up the first movie...but too much to ask for any movie to wrap up several more on top of it. Seems like they bit off a bit more than this movie could chew through. There are some great moments and action sequences which comes as no surprise-just wish they could have paired it down to a more manageable storyline. While kinda fun, the time travel is a bit much to take. Reminds me of some of the cornier plots from comics in the 80s.[換行字元][換行字元]Can't wait for Marvel Woke Universe in 2020!"
4135,It's the best movie ever made but only if you have see the other 22 movies that are before this.
4136,"After 21 movies in the MCU, Endgame manages to not only bring a satisfying ending for this saga, but it also manages to bring up a coherent story full of intense and emotional moments, and a wonderful third act final battle that blows my mind. Despite having an ambitious plot overall, the Russo Brothers created an espectacular movie where everyone in the general audience can enjoy."
4137,Was it good? Of course it was.... Was it the best one in the series? Not even close... I was so excited for this movie and I left disappointed.
4138,"A poor finish to the avengers saga. Too many characters with not enough to do. The final battle was underwhelming. Some of the main characters (Thor,hulk) reduced to buffoonery. Some good points like cap and Starks final ending. Thanos is probably one of the best baddies ever. The guardian's and antman were poor. Far too long a film and was padded in places although I can forgive it because we probably wo t be seeing the actors continuing in their roles. Not as disappointing as game of thrones though. Younger viewers will love it."
4139,Marvel has over the years delivered movie after movie and we have been watching. Not only did they give us the ending we needed but they did it in a way which connected everything we have seen through the MCU. I just want to some how forget that the MCU exists so that I can watch all the movies all over again. Will definitely be seeing Endgame again in cinema.
4140,"Stunning movie , had me on the edge of my seat the whole movie"
4141,People were cheering one minute then weeping the next. No spoilers here but this was what we all hoped for. A fitting end.
4142,The movie was great with the best ending I could ask for in a superhero movie (that I predicted BTW) and the action was on point!
4143,The bar was set really high with Infinity war. This movie is good but there is sth missing. I went to the cinema expecting a spectacular movie and I got a good watch nothing that would be up to my expectations. And I believe many of us who have seen the movie are disappointed.
4144,"I think they could have made it better. Overall still a good watch. It is fun and a good spectacle, but storyline could have been better."
4145,This movie exceeds your wildest imagination about how things gets concluded... Tony stark aka Iron man you are the one why I started watching marvel movies other than Iron man and will miss you and always love you 3000 times... Kudos to whole cast and crew And the ultimate legends the Russos.... take a bow truly blown away from your endgame. Thanks marvel for making our 11 yrs remarkable. Always a marvel fan #whateverittakes
4146,I loved everything about this movie and it showed how even Heroes have issues to work through and can fail... I just cant say much more than go watch it and love it if you watched all the MCU movies leading up to this one!
4147,"I can't say anything, i just love this movie so much."
4148,A film to make it unpredictable should not be sacrificed like this. should not be watched with great expectation. I am very sad.
4149,I went to see this with high hopes but wasnt sure however i went to see this and boy was i impressed the action was full and exciting and even the humor was funny i do suggest if your theater lets you get extra snacks as the movie is long in lenth so so good though also keep it away from small kids the violence is too extreme for their little minds
4150,"GRADE: B[換行字元][換行字元]THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.[換行字元][換行字元]IN BRIEF: Technically well done, this sci-fi blockbuster will entertain most moviegoers, especially its rabid fanbase.[換行字元][換行字元]JIM'S REVIEW: Before sharing my critic-proof and spoiler-proof review of this year's biggest blockbuster sequel, let me state that Avengers: Endgame is a worthy follow-up to 2018's mega-hit, Avengers: Infinity Wars. Fans needed to wait a whole year for Part Two for answers to questions which left them hanging in fine cliff-hanging tradition.[換行字元][換行字元]But first, my own nagging question...does anyone really die in sci-fi ?[換行字元][換行字元]Resurrection and The Moral Good must triumph. Besides, everyone loves a comeback. After all, this is a fantasy adventure in a sci-fi world and there is a set formula. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeeley take the inevitable logical plot device to foil Thanos' plan at universal domination, which shouldn't surprise anyone who has read comic books as a child. Many battles will ensue, which makes up most of the film's action and sub-plots. (However, it must be said, that there was one glaring leap of logic involving one unnamed character stealing the Tesseract, the movie's McGuffin, that remains unanswered.)[換行字元][換行字元]Epic in scope and length (nearly 3 hours), the film is a satisfying thrill ride, although it does take awhile to assemble the gang. Much (too much) time is spent with sketchy character development and tons of exposition. While most of the storytelling seizes upon engaging interactions with its more colorful assortment of characters, there are still some missed opportunities. The film is also anti-climactic and could have used some judicious editing despite its crowd-pleasing goals to tidy up all loose ends.[換行字元][換行字元]Still, Avengers: Endgame is an amazing accomplishment which should please the series' fanbase. The filmmakers assembles many, if not all, of the Marvel superheroes, both major and minor. The actors reprise their roles with varying degrees of importance and excitement. Some register as insignificant cameos and walk-ons; others provide strong contributions to the film; a few characters simply mystify their existence within the Marvel family. The film makes strides to impress its audience with its sheer magnitude and cast of thousands and takes its own mythology very seriously and, for the most part, succeeds.[換行字元][換行字元]Technically adept, much of the movie has top-notch CGI visuals and well staged action sequences directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Also impressive is their seamless handling of previous footage from other Marvel movies and their reenactments within a parallel dimension. The music score by Alan Silvestri is highly effective and Trent Opaloch's cinematography adds atmosphere and style. The editing team of Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt keep the interlocking episodes moving and allow the action to be clearly viewed, a rarity in today's blurry techno-shoot-em-ups.[換行字元][換行字元]Some of the actors provide more memorable star turns than others. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Paul Rudd, Mark Ruffalo, and Josh Brolin do a yeoman-like job. Jeremy Renner may sport a new hair-do-over, but his low-tier character still lacks considerable interest, The heroines portrayed by Scarlett Johansson, Elizabeth Olsen, and Brie Larson remain underwritten and underwhelming, despite a very forced woman's empowerment battle moment that serves only as a contrived sign of the times.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers: Endgame is far from the final stage of this film franchise. As comic book superhero movies go, this is one of the better efforts. In this ""final"" version, some superheroes perish, a few fade from memory, but most survive...as does this series. It will goes on...and on, making this one of the most profitable franchises in movie history.[換行字元][換行字元]So let me re-phase my opening question in this review: Does any sci-fi really die?"
4151,I dont like the movie. It doesn't deserve to be in top 100 movie.
4152,"Wow. Wow. Wow I just watched Avengers Endgame and it took me for the most intense emotional rollercoaster of my life! I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I sat in awe. What an insane way to wrap up this Saga.10/10. I'm speechless. What you did #Marvel"
4153,Every one saying that it is bad is completely wrong. This is by far one of the best movie in the MCU and in the world.
4154,"Do not bother going in with low expectations because no matter how HIGH they are, it will still blow you away. The scope is huge. The drama is huge. The actual tension is heart racing. Enjoy, to the end. Take some tissues."
4155,"I really want to try a make a decent review about this movie but I can't seem to come to a conclusion whether or not I can definitively like it overall. As far as the plot goes it seemed like a real cop out way to solve all the problems while also leaving as many doors open as possible for future ideas. The story does a terrible job at being able to stand by itself in the cinematic universe as there are so many call backs to past films. Fans who have seen all the movies will have a blast but those who are not familiar with the 21 movie lineup will be left out of the loop. I have to recommend refreshing yourself with some of the significant entries in the universe to fully appreciate the spectacle you are about to see.[換行字元][換行字元]Like I said in the title this movie has so much fan service that you can't help but leap and yell they actually did that! Of course I will not mention any of it but it had to be said that they get a freaking A+ for adding as much as they did in one jam packed movie. I am honestly trying to express my feelings about the beautiful ending but no matter what I type, it feels as though I am going to give something away. I will keep it short and say they made it so sweet, sincere, and heartbreaking that this may be where some fans will stop watching and say ""this is the conclusion I wanted""... well of course in actuality they won't cause the MCU is awesome but the thought will cross their mind. :)[換行字元][換行字元]Overall I have decided that I enjoyed watching this entry but still prefer part 1. Mainly because it is concise and straight forward; you really have to be open minded and go with the flow in part 2 which I didn't enjoy."
4156,"Do not wait, watch it, you won't be disappointed. I am sure it will break all records in movie history. Well done Marvel"
4157,This film does an amazing job of wrapping up character's individual stories. Their collective and solo handling of Thanos' snap from the last film is satisfyingly detailed. Epic battles. Large scale powers. Must watch! I enjoyed it thoroughly.
4158,"Can't believe the Avengers series end up with Endgame. I enjoyed this movie so much, at the same time my heart melted(too upset)[換行字元][換行字元]So long AVENGERS 😭😭😭"
4159,"Good performances, good dialogue driven scenes, nicely written emotional scenes, stunning visuals and an incredible third act. Such a wonderful culmination to 11 years of film making."
4160,"Avengers : End Game was way too long. They could have wrapped up this story in 1hr 30min instead of stretching it out to 3hr. If you are less than a rabid fan I would recommend that you see this film at home. The crowd in my theater was attentive but strangely quiet and I didn't get much of a sense of excitement from the audience. Black Widow and Hawkeye had the best stories in this film and Ironman second. Ant man showed up and was fun and Rocket (the trash panda) represented the Guardians of the Galaxy (I'm a big Rocket fan 😊). I did not care for the Thor bit. I was disappointed with how they handled Thor's character - it just wasn't funny. The other Marvel characters showed up but the directors could have just set up cardboard cutouts and had voiceovers for all they contributed to the story line. It does not work as a stand-alone film - you have to have seen the previous films to understand it. I made my poor sister go to the movie with me (she had not seen all the previous films) and she felt tortured and bored (her words). She said that I now owe her ""big time"" Sheesh..."
4161,Loved every minute of it and I'm going to view it again! Favourite movie of all! Can't wait for more!
4162,It was disappointing total out of brains and not as perfect as before these two brothers messed up this time the acting was terrible and i will never watch any movie from marvel studios any more waste of money and time
4163,"Awesome movie, very epic. I advise everyone to see it."
4164,This movie is the perfect send off to a series that has been around since 2008 with the original iron man. the final battle scene was all you could ask for and left me breathless but i do wish chris evans could stay around.
4165,This is too good Damn this is too good Damn i like this movie Omg capt america
4166,"I am not a Marvel fans so I hadn't seen many marvel movies so far . I think a good movie especially such magnitude like avenger 4 should let most people can understand content even I didn't see other marvel movies before. As a non marvel fans moviegoer , avenger 4 is not a good movie for the audiences like me . So that why I think this movie has wild room to improve because I still think audiences like me are not the minority"
4167,Ending of the Avenger with awesomeness but I feel little slow than other Avenger because of too emotional scenes.
4168,"And that is the problem with Avenger movies. You just can't get everybody in and give them decent screen time. I love all of the heroes but I hope this is the last Avengers movie of the all or nothing variety. Maybe a situationally derived squad based series, ala Mission Impossible."
4169,"If you don't watch this movie , you are missing so much things.Go and watch this movie.You are going to freaking out. And Robert , we love you 3000.❤"
4170,Without a doubt the best of the all the marvel movies
4171,"Best marvel movie ever, conclusion of the 21 marvel movies don't think much just go for it 😍😍💟💟"
4172,"I laughed, I cried, I mourned... best super hero film of all time."
4173,Endgame encapsulates the greatness of the MCU. The only reason why I am not giving it a 10 is because of the few scenes that weren't really bothering but unnecessary. Besides that the movie is a 10.
4174,"The movie is fun and entertaining overall. But it is supposed to tie up all the loose ends of the previous films of this franchise, which contradicts with a lot of plots of this particular film. Maybe we should just turn a blind eye and give it a pass because this ending can't be more epic or whatever, but this is the one movie we've waited for so long for me to say like, that's such a great way to tie it up and all. Because it's not. There are so many inconsistencies and cringy moments in this movie. And it doesn't give me the feeling of Infinity War or Cival War. The level of conflict is just not there. So to sum it up, it is kinda enjoyable as a comedy, but I'm personally not satisfied in a whole bunch of ways."
4175,I am literally 3 hours closer to the grave with nothing of note to show for it.
4176,"OMG! What have I just watched? Remake of Avengers: Infinity War?[換行字元][換行字元]The last installment of Avengers looks like another Infinity War with table turning (this time we won) and introduction of few new elements such as Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and time machine. The rest is pretty much the same: whole lot of super-heroes doing crash-smash-flash-zap-bang super-fictional thing we already seen in earlier Avengers. OK, have to admit CGI is awesome but if you strip that the result is below average movie to watch once and leave in archive (if you mistakenly bought disc).[換行字元][換行字元]Bottom line, I really don't see End Game as a ""Masterpiece"" just because it filled-up box office emerging on top of all movies. It is not something we have not seen before, no breakthrough, not better than Infinity War. Just good advertising boosted this up on hall of fame scale."
4177,Overhyped overrated movie. Plot Holes. Ruined Characters. Not waste your time
4178,"Words aren't enough to describe the culmination of the Infinity Saga. It was just beautiful, from the amazing action set pieces to the well knit plot that tied up all the main character's story archs in a fulfilling way, all I can say is Marvel and the Russo Brothers really outdid themselves this time round. 11/10 for me."
4179,"Good but nowhere near as good as people are saying, it's just the same as all the other superhero movies really nothing special."
4180,😍 Best movie ever. I've never seen anyzhing like this. Outstanding performance.
4181,"Considering the high credentials and the hype around this last Avengers movie, I am not 100% impressed. The movie itself is epic almost throughout the film. It could be a little bit better tho sometimes, i don't know. It still damn good but that is just a few things. The beginning of the film and the first 30 minutes was not so good i think, but it was like the film just got better and better over time. Chris Hemsworth, he grabs the ax and say ""I like her"" powerful and mighty scene. The endgame theme song is really nice as well. Every actor in this one does such an incredible job. Chris Hemsworth is so damn good in all ways in this one. When Thanos get to know their plan it gets a lot more exciting! Towards the ending, the film goes from good to freaking amazing and insane! Everything gets decided in the final battle....! The graphics and the scenes in the final battle is Epic. All i can say...!! :)"
4182,"It was so difficult to give a final of all previous movie, all the characters and the lines (historically speaking). At the end it was a complex work and it is well done. Somethings could be not enough, or not required but at the end it was a great work."
4183,"The movie is so good. There's nothing for me to even Comic Book Guy about. It's just amazing beginning to end. This is coming from a die hard DC fan and this is by far the best comic book movie I've ever seen in my life. You'll laugh, you'll cry it put pulls on all the right heart strings."
4184,It's so good I actually got a heart attack in the theaters and fell out of my seat during the climax. 10/10 would get a heart attack again 👌
4185,"I laughed, I cried, it was an amazing ride. Admittedly, Endgame is not as strong as Infinity War but, it is a wonderful experience. This movie is heavy. The emotional content is appropriate for a film entitled ""Endgame."" You will be overwhelmed by the feels in this one. The CGI is top notch, and as usual in Marvel movies, a flawless cocktail of humor and action fill the screen. There is less action than I initially expected but more than enough to satisfy the average(too bad I'm not the averagw). Cheering is an uncontrollable side effect when watching the events unfold. There are some surprises that will make your jaw drop. This one comes highly recommended from me. It's a visual spectacle. In order to help manage expectations, it is not as powerful as ""Infinity War."" In my humble opinion, very few movies are as deeply exciting as I.W. As a continuation, and an ending to an era, it's solid to say the least. #seeit"
4186,3 hours out of my life I will never get back. not worth the hype. you think the soap opera is done by the ultimate battle. think again. let us milk it and release another spider man. geez a lou.
4187,"Watched Avenger Endgame A movie of joy, fun, sorrow and everything you want in superheroes movies. Movie is of 3hrs and 1min but it has great pace. You won't even realize when the movie gets finished. What an opportunity to watch all the avengers in one movie. And that scene when Captain America, Thor, Ironman were fighting against Thanos gave me goosebumps. The role of superhero I liked the most was ""Ant-man"". How funny character that was. Movie has some many plot&twist. You got more than what you have imagined before watching the movie. But there was some flaws in movie too. Some character didn't do justice with their roles. ""Thor"" the most powerful avenger looks funny and didn't play a major role in defeating thanos whereas Captain America and Wanda have so much power.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall movie was enjoying. One of the best movie series I have been watching since childhood came to an end."
4188,"Such an amazing work by marvel. For me personally, it is one of the best movie I have ever watched in my life where I was literally getting goosebumps while watching it. Must recommend to everyone to go and watch it."
4189,The best! A los of emotion and action. Very easy to watch.
4190,"The Super Russo Brothers have outdone themselves again. Endgame is the movie that has it all .The acting was commendable . The plot was great with several scenes which completed our hero's story arc. There was plenty to enjoy in endgame . Overall , it's a winner . I'm excited for what will come next in the mcu.[換行字元][換行字元]P.S, Bring tissues along No reason :("
4191,"After 2nd time watching the movie, I just want to wish; please big headed 🍆<=>THANOS, Snap for the one last time. Because I don't wanna move on after this for what ever it takes. Seriously now what ❓😭❓😭❓"
4192,"Deus ex machina? No Deus ex capt. Marvela! I audibly groaned at the A-Force shot because it made no sense in the context of the film, and it's pandering to a tiny minority of the community that mocks these types of movies anyway. It's not just male characters that were trivialized by Miss Marvel. All the organic female heroines were also pacified by Captain Marvel, most of all, Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch. Brie Larson is the toxic element that has contaminated the MCU. She literally ruined exery scene she was in. She is a repulsive human and a horrible ACTRESS! Remove her and get #IdentityPolitics out of the MCU!"
4193,"Perfect ending, enough said. It was worth waiting all those years since they first showed Thanos in Avengers. All the heroes have come so far since then. Proud to have been able to be a part of this incredible journey as an audience member."
4194,So sad about some character's passing but this was an amazing watch and a great end!
4195,"Some of theories that you've seen online, happens, but not really. All I can say is they done a great job and there was the epic moment, which is my favorite scene. This movie will make you laugh, happy, amaze, and having a mental breakdown at the same time."
4196,Too long and sometimes boring. Worst Marvel's movie. My daughter didn't like it too
4197,"Its probably the first marvel movie where i was playing with my phone and that says a lot. Its a boring movie, full of plot holes, only 20min of fight scenes in total and drama. LOTS and LOTS of drama, moaning and crying again and again.[換行字元][換行字元]So, to sum it up: * Plot holes not even the biggest fans can ignore. * Inconsistencies between the movies. * Way too many characters, just to appear on the movie, doing basically nothing. * Huge changes to main characters, making them also useless. * Almost no fight scenes! Set the alarm clock after 120min in the movie. * Drama, crying, moaning, REPEAT.[換行字元][換行字元]You have been warned, but it doesn't matter because you will ignore all the negative reviews and still go and see the movie. That's what i did, the same mistake. Go grab a pizza and watch Arrow, trust me you'll have better time."
4198,This movie may not have lived up to many of your expectations but when you really get down to it and listen to the whole of the movies all 22 of them and then watch this you will come to see it's perfect it stands by its roots and also reshapes what we believe is possible from the marvel movies no spoilers bu here but there cant be life without death right.
4199,"I'm going to try and write this with absolutely no spoilers. The movie overall was excellent. The storyline, characters, events, everything. Of course there were some times where I wanted to just scream and leave, but at the end it all was one giant piece of emotion. A beautiful love letter to the fans, cast and especially RDJ. nothing will ever top this. Everybody told me that I'll cry and i certainly did, from the beginning to the very end. However, there are some key things that the Russos just tossed out the window, not gonna mention anything for spoiling reasons, and that just bothered me. As a fan for the longest time, it hurt me a little seeing certain things turn out the way they did. But I'm grateful for everything that happened and so happy to have watched that movie. Also i don't know if this is a spoiler or not, but if you're expecting to see Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) as a main superhero character, don't. She doesn't get much screen time as the others, which is sad and good, but more good, because the movie is about the main 6 avengers."
4200,"Brilliant. Full of humour, excitement & emotional impact. An entirely satisfying conclusion to the 22-film MCU Infinity Saga. So much so I have an urge to watch them all again."
4201,"This is a movie thats really worth your time, especially the final fight. I don't want to spoil the movie but its worth 3 hours of your time"
4202,Only someone who hates superhero movies would give a rating below 10.
4203,"A thousand things unexplained just get all heroes from previous movies and put them all in a big heroic legendary fight, they won't even wonder how the hell they got back they just know they are there to fight like it was all planned out. I honestly expected much more but since Marvel had to put an ending to this extravaganza they had to end the storyline abruptly it's like making a masterpiece of painting throughout the years and in the end grabbing a knife to stab the whole piece with holes and leaving everything to the viewer's imagination."
4204,First off good movie but not spectacular. But infinity war was wayyyyyy better. Story line and build up made it really exciting. Now Endgame has its moments but almost an 1:30 of just a boring story line and average pace. People in the theater were not excited at all when I compare it to infinity war. We do have some funny and really touching parts. The last fight seen seemed rushed and not utilizing every character I felt was a flaw. You are ending this entire chapter of the last 10 years and most of the characters were barely used at all. I see why people like it and had the emotional connection because you are aware this is the last ride for many of them. But in my opinion infinity war has a much better story and build up that I actually left the theater really excited. When endgame finished. No one clapped and the atmosphere in the room felt like something was missing. If you are an mcu fan watch it. But don't have high expectations.
4205,This film is nothing but amazing it is the best way to end an era of MCU. Personally if this film is rated less than an 8 I think that this is extremely harsh and I think everyone in the theatre or that watches this film will shed a tear at some point. WHAT A FILM!!! . WHAT A MOMENT!!! WHAT A JOURNEY!!!
4206,I don't wanna spoil. honestly don't get over hyped. its not 10 star or 9. it deserves 8 Made for Marvel fans Not good as Infinity war but not bad for 3 hours Hilarious Thor! :D
4207,"I've been a longstanding fan of the MCU my entire life, and Endgame definatly delivered. If Infinity War was Thanos movie, then Endgame definatly belongs to the Avengers. This movie accomplishes all it intends to do, to give fans a satisfying end to a 22 film franchise. ( Even though there are many more films to come)[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is not without its faults however, the pacing is a little off sometimes, and there are a few scenes where one could ask ""Is this really necessary to the plot?"". The directions taken with some characters are really good, while others are... Interesting.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall if you are a marvel fan you will love Endgame, but make no mistake you need to be a marvel fan. If you haven't seen a bulk of the MCU films you will be lost through the majority of Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie provides a satisfying conclusion to the original Avengers story. It is not without its faults, but overall Endgame leaves you more satisfied then dissatisfied when leaving the theater."
4208,"This is the epic conclusion of first 11 years. It's higher then our expectations. The enjoyment watching it is thousands time higher then infinity war. We all should watch the movie in theaters. And try not to spoil it. This movie make us laugh, cried, again cried and again cried. Oh don't forget to take tissue while you go to theatre to watch it. Again don't spoil the ENDGAME."
4209,"I am from India and not a regular movie reviewer , I never deemed it necessary, in fact this is my first ever review of any movie in IMDb . I had only watched handful of movies for last 2 years and all marvel movies were included in that. And boy am I glad to have watched them all . Just so I could get to the finish line , nowadays commonly known as ENDGAME. And I have to say I was in awe , shock , happy (all experienced at the same time, I know I also thought that was impossible). It's like they have created a new genre of movies and the future movies will be created on ""Avengers"" genre. People will not say , it's SciFi or comedy or drama or fantasy genre. They will just say it's an avenger genre. Don't listen to any of the haters out there and just enjoy this historical masterpiece. It was perfect ratetouille . No mixture was imbalanced. Acting was top notch as always. And funny moments were as original as there can be. Tear-jerker moments will never leave you alone. I tried really really hard not to cry for some of the moments (obviously failed).[換行字元][換行字元]My only suggestion is just get your tasrif(ass) off and go to the theatre as soon as possible. So that no-one can surprise you with any spoilers. Because a single knowledge can put your whole enjoyment for this movie into trash. So GO."
4210,Best possible ending. What a great ending for the pst 11 years.
4211,"This is everything a movie enthusiast can ever want. There's ample amount of everything, be it comedy, surprises and of course ACTION! I personally cried for 10 minutes (😆), I don't think you could want anything more then what the end of the endgame offers. It maybe bittersweet but it's satisfying for sure (and of course you knew it's gonna be the end of the current MCU phase). This movie was the final nail in the coffin of my childhood and I doubt I'd ever be this excited for a movie again."
4212,Been a marvel fan since 10+ years and I am absolutely satisfied by this Finale . Acting is the core of this movie . There are some scenes where RDJ just win our hearts ( as usual) with his dialogue dilevery. I won't write much but trust me you will enjoy this movie more than anything specially if you are Marvel Fan . I love avengers 3000 times😍💓💙
4213,"Only the final fight is good, remaining movie is all too much emotional drama for a Marvel movie."
4214,"This movie is, quite honestly, worthy of everybody's three hours. Although it is, and it really is, three hours long, it is worth it.[換行字元][換行字元]Upon seeing it on opening night in London, I found that the Cinema was jam-packed, chock full of excited Marvel fans.

The fan moments in this film are a joy to experience - and I was especially lucky to go and see it on opening night. When you-know-what happened, the look on everybody's face was one of surprise, joy, pure, unfiltered bliss. The screams and roars of happiness actually reverberated through all 5 filled auditoriums that were being used to show the film in, all at once, as all had begun at the same time. It felt ecstatic, and it's something you'll see in very few films.[換行字元][換行字元]It's never happened for me, and it's probably never happened for you.[換行字元][換行字元]11 years, and we've come to this? Salute to you, Russo Brothers. I love you both 3000."
4215,"No matter How Great the Ending Is, We all feel sad about it..! I was a 9 year Old Kid When this all Started.. Became Huge Fan after Avnegers 1, watched and rewatched every Single Movie of this Infinity Saga, And now when its all ended i want it to start over..! Overall Summary Of the Movie is It is Everything u want it to be and way above than our Expections..! I am Eternally Gratefull For this Journey..!"
4216,"Where to begin. 30 mins in I got an uneasy feeling. An hour in something felt very wrong. Two hours in I was in shock. This film is a bloated, BORING, convoluted slog of time travel utter nonsense. The positive reviews of this film have me convinced that professional reviewers, pod-casters and tv/youtube talking heads are being paid for favorable reviews. I'd hate to sound like a conspiracy minded person but... During the 3 hours in a sold-out theatre I barley heard a chuckle as most of the jokes fell flat, rare for a marvel movie. The end garnered no applause, also rare for an event movie like this. So many characters are minimized or just poorly written. For the record I loved Infinity War. I thought I was walking in to the greatest comic book super hero movie ever and I could not be more disappointed."
4217,"Call me a fan boy, mock my words, do your worst. This for me, was by far, the best movie I have ever seen. They have smashed it out of the park, and some. I have read so called critic reviews, who have taken the high ground on certain plot points and questioned the detail.[換行字元][換行字元]Why? Why not just sit back and appreciate what we fans have been waiting for, for over a decade. This is truly the best film in my lifetime. Go watch it. I hope I can still see it on the big screen in ten years time."
4218,Film is very good and little bit of comedy scenes are excellent. climax is really emotional for weak hearts. but there are some sarcasm which is little annoying. overall the film is awesome.
4219,"Avengers Endgame - Bit of action, fun, emotion, sentiment, goosebump moments. Good movie. I dunno if am very satisfied or not, have to watch later again.[換行字元][換行字元]I watched it in 4DX. Good experience but whopping 28$/ticket.

4220,"Not a massive marvel nerd but have watched most of them and this is far and away the best of the ensemble movies.[換行字元][換行字元]After the throw everything at the wall approach of infinity war this was a welcome change of pace , there was masses of fan service, so much in fact I was a little lost in parts as there as some Marvel movies I haven't seen.[換行字元][換行字元]Thor and Hulk were wasted characters again, but Hawkeye and Black Widow finally got the screen time they deserved, Ant man was worked in well and the pay offs for Stark and Captain America were done really well.[換行字元][換行字元]There were a couple of scenes that could have been cut and it wouldn't have made a difference to the whole thing but that's being a bit picky.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall i enjoyed it, not as good as Iron man 1, Cap America 1 or Captain Marvel but got 2 visits to the cinema from me so it was good enough."
4221,Speechless. You have to watch it to feel this amazing movie
4222,"Infinity war was way better, in my opinion. There was a lot of plot holes in the movie to begin with. They had many cringe bathos moments and they crammed in too much emotional elements just to make the movie a n uplifting finale."
4223,"It's hard to put into words my feelings after seeing this film. Endgame is an epic, unpredictable, and emotional end to the most impressive long-form storytelling in cinematic history. This film is captivating for its entire 3 hour run time, with every scene and piece of dialogue carefully crafted with purpose. The payoffs and callbacks to previous moments in the MCU are amazing and reward those who have been loyal to this franchise. Avengers: Endgame absolutely surpasses the massive expectations it had and closes the book perfectly on an unprecedented saga of films."
4224,"This movie drug on far too long. Captain Marvel ruined every scene she was in. Stars given for Thors performance which was hilarious. Looking forward to Ragnorak 2, maybe."
4225,"I will try not to include any spoilers in my short review. The little issue I had with Infinity War was that it had too many segments/parts, and I felt like it made the movie feel like 3-4 movies, without a perfect blend. But with Endgame, the different parts, and the different superheroes make a perfect blend.[換行字元][換行字元]The first half of the movie is kind of slow, but the second half is out of this world. There are fight scenes that would have you applauding out loud even if you were never one to do that in the past...there are so many surprises. If you have followed all the other MCU movies up to this point, you would love this movie. I give it a 9/10."
4226,"I'm not gonna say much cause it spoils te movie, but this is what we have all been waiting for."
4227,"All through this movie it just feels like they are setting up an homage to the past marvel movies and characters, this in itself is not a bad ploy but the way it is executed is lame. They do not even try to make it interesting. And the whole movies drags along this way like it is entering some kind of depression. The Quantum time travel idea is extremely badly executed. it seems the idea was just an excuse to visit past movies and characters. In addition the characters are lame, they just don't have any mojo about themselves. It just feels like they knew it was the end and everybody appears bored or not interested. The last fight is pathetic. Again no excitement at all. And the heroes that died felt like they had to die just for the sake of it. Pathetic movie, even by Marvel standards."
4228,I'm not being too hype or making this movie too overrated but I'm saying that this movie really deserve a perfect score.. The Russo Brothers really did an awesome work.. They way they make the storyline and all the scenes create a perfect ending for all 11 years journey.. This movie contains so many awesome and unbelievable moments.. It brings you a lot of different emotions and im sure that gonna affect your feelings so much (if you're really a Marvel fanboy).. Truly an amazing film.. Thank you Marvel...
4229,"What an epic conclusion. There will be no spoilers here. If you are a fan of the MCU and love the characters, as I do, this very well could top your list. It is a perfect send off movie and truly an epic conclusion. Yes, there is less action compared to Infinity War but the final fight in this movie is my favorite of both the movies. That seems to be a theme. If you are just a general audience member and dont love or know everything about the characters, you may like IW more - its faster and has more stuff going on. That isnt to say Endgame is slow, but IW was Thanos' movie and he was the only character that needed character time in the movie. In this one every single of the main characters got avid character growth - especially the original 6. Every character scene was just fantastic. Go see it. 10/10"
4230,"I'm not fan of this kind of movies. My hasband made me to watch it in cinema. All I can say Chris Pratt fantastic actor, very talented"
4231,"That was my best experience from Avengers, Great Great Everything was great"
4232,"No director can perform better than Russell. I love it more than I can say. Maybe it's let you down ,so what? It's really a good ending. Only accept full marks!!Knock The Shawshank Redemption (1994) down!"
4233,"Avenger endgame is one of the best movie , I have ever seen. It is a power combo pack of friends love, sacrifies and determination for goal. I don't believe that Avenger end game would be require any change because it is perfectly directed and and no errors."
4234,This was hands down the best Marvel movie made. What a beautiful and neat conclusion it brought to a decade long adventure. Thank you to everyone who worked on it.
4235,"EXCELLENT BETTER THAN INFINITY WAR !!! BETTER THAN A LOT OF SUPERHERO MOVIES AND IT SEEMS MARVEL WINS !! WHEN ARE THEY MAKING BATMAN VS HULK???? COZ THAT WAS ACTUALLY A COMIC ,,GOOGLE IT !! AND JOACHIN PHOENIX AS THE JOKER IS MAKING ME KINDA HAPPY AND HOPEFUL FOR THE COMIC BOOK ART MOVIES THAT ARE SOMETIMES GREAT LIKE WATCHMEN AND DARK NIGHT and YES TO ENDGAME[換行字元][換行字元]STAN LEE WOULD BE PROUD OF ENDGAME[換行字元][換行字元]NUFF SAID"
4236,"To witness the end of this legendary franchise is bittersweet. This movie makes one cry, laugh, smile, think, cheer, worry, and imagine. It is perfection. Everything from acting, directing, sound effects, and storytelling is flawless. I watched it twice already and I am eager to watch it again."
4237,"Quite simply the best Marvel movie ever made and the best Marvel movie experience I've ever had. What an incredible 3 hours of cinema. I'm speechless from the last part and can't quite believe Marvel pulled off a movie with so many characters as well as they did when the MCU started just 11 years ago. The end of an era. The beginning of a new one. Marvel, you've done it again, you marvellous human beings."
4238,Best film I've ever seen however there was no excuse for Daisy Johnson and Robbie Reyes (arguably the 2 most powerful characters in the whole MCU) to just not turn up at all!
4239,I realize that I'm getting old. I almost fell asleep watching this movie. Kids will definitely like it. A lot of actions that make no sense. Iron Man\Tony Stark is one of the overestimated character.
4240,"Satisfying 3-hours in which you go through a lot of emotions. And the best feeling is when you sit in a theater with NO empty seats, and everyone goes through the same thing like you do. We all clap when there's a satisfying scene that explains or goes well with all the references in the past. We all laugh out loud at MCU's clever and silly jokes. And we all cry when there's a sad thing happening (don't want to spoil you so that's all I can say).[換行字元][換行字元]I guess that's all you need to know to understand that it's worth it to see the movie, and definitely more worth it to see it with other fellow MCU fans. It's been 12 hours and I'm still not over the movie yet, keep talking about it. Thank you Marvel for a successful movie series. Thank you for giving us years of awesomeness. You have made and ended the journey with extraordinary storytelling. Thank you!!"
4241,"Endgame is a great popcorn action movie to ""finish"" a saga of popcorn action movies. This isn't serious entertainment and shouldn't be considered as such, and it reminds me of how George Lucas made Star Wars as an homage to the cheap serials like Flash Gordon. Especially as comic-sourced material, this is what the MCU is. Some part of me is actually a bit pained to like it as much as I do, given that it is just playing on base emotions to make money for a massive conglomerate like Disney.[換行字元][換行字元]BUT... what a great way to end several major storylines that they invested in over the past 11 years. For people who have watched the saga, I feel like this is just the cherry on the top. My only complaint is something that you can't really get away from in superhero stories: the character ""powers"" are totally inconsistent from scene to scene, and movie to movie. This is a trope that there's no getting away from, because if characters like Captain Marvel, Thor, Scarlet Witch, and Hulk were always as powerful as they show flashes of, then the story wouldn't even be a thing. Any one of them could destroy Thanos in the blink of an eye, and have done similar feats in other stories (and even in other scenes within a given story). That they sometimes ""reduce"" their power to a lower level, without an explained mechanism, is pretty laughable, and makes some parts of the story a bit nonsensical. Yes, this constant Ex Machina is needed to maintain the drama and keep the plot going, but it's still something that takes me out of the story.[換行字元][換行字元]What I really love about this movie, and the saga as a whole, is how good it is at developing the actual characters and their relationships. There are some similarities, but nobody is the same, and most of the arcs are believable. Thor's story, and apparent PTSD, is to me the best-done, but all of the majors (and some of the minors) are almost as good. I believed them. And for a popcorn action movie saga based on a comic series, I think that's a pretty high compliment."
4242,"No spoiler brief review for fans and non fans:-[換行字元][換行字元]If you are a Marvel fan, then you know you shouldn't miss this movie so please watch it before anyone spoils it for you. Even if someone does spoil it, the movie is worth watching for its spectacular special effects, music by Alan Silvestri and stellar performances by the cast. The 3D version of the movie is nice as the 3D effect adds additional depth to the fight scenes and space scenes. It's a movie that has so many scenes which feel like they are there to please the fans and the scenes have a lot of emotional impact because of the character development as well as back-story that have built up the emotions throughout the years. This movie is something that should be kept in your DVD or Blu-Ray collections when officially released later on, as there are so many things in this movie which will make you want to revisit it and relive the moments. You will not get bored by this movie and might as well watch it twice or even more times in the theater.[換行字元][換行字元]If you are not a Marvel fan or haven't watched any of the Marvel movies, the movie does tell you what happened in the Avengers Infinity War and even if you won't be able to identify with some of the characters, you can guess that Avengers are the good people and they are trying to stop the bad guy, Thanos from conquering the world and also to try and repair what he did in the Infinity War movie. The movie is worth watching for its special effects, acting, music and great production value. Some character decisions might divide the audience, so how you feel will depend on your personal attachment and expectations form a particular super hero character's story arc.[換行字元][換行字元]This is the last Russo Bros. Marvel film according to a GamesRadar Interview and the last Stan Lee cameo (RIP). Go watch it!"
4243,"I really wanted it to be good, I really wanted it to be excellent. But it was just slightly above average. It was way too long. I couldn't wait till it was over. I really don't want to give anything away, but I think it's one of those movies if you're watching it on DVD at home, you would have paused it and a lot of times to do other things."
4244,This movie is amazing. Great culmination of every inch of the previous MCU movies. Will watch multiple times in theaters and own as soon as it becomes available.
4245,"The first half of the movie is incredibly boring, second half is awesome. No emotional attachment to the final scene, it dragged on way too long.[換行字元][換行字元]Infinity war was way better in my opinion, better balance between action and slow scenes."
4246,Where to start???? This is such a bad movie that I am so disappointed with Marvel. Can't believe critics who are rating such movies so high. Its very clear that we cannot go by what critics say. Good movies are bad and bad movies are good!!
4247,I can't decide whether it's better than Infinity War in my opinion but as a conclusion of the previous 21 films before it I couldn't of asked for more. Anything other than a 9 or 10 does not do justice to what Marvel have achieved over the last 11 years
4248,"Actually it's a good movie, but the directors, writers, and graphic editors don't do a proper job. 1. Some of CGI especially when they wearing the suit is so nasty. The cut in their neck shows a lot, if they are so bad in editing. 2. They don't exploring Thanos so much, so conflict they build in their story line like standard super hero movie, nothing special at all."
4249,Avengers endgame might be long but it feels like the fastest 3 hour movie I've seen. Everything works even with the few plot holes. The action is evenly paced and works where they put it and all leads up to the greatest climatic battle scene in a long long time.
4250,Best movie ever all time!! If you thought infinity war was great. This movie definitely goes above and beyond! Lots of action and I found myself getting emotional at times. Great movie!
4251,"Very good, I like this one, all moments were awesome"
4252,"No spoilers....and please don't spoil for others as well. It is a movie that you must watch if you are mcu fan. Overall movie is amazing, nicely directed and great mix of comedy and emotions just like other mcu movies 😍👌🏻"
4253,"The special effects are top notch, but the film is very bloated at 3 hours when its a simple tale of a cop out time travel ending. There exists a ""De-Feminized Fanedit"" that proves the point, at a little less than half the length it tells the same story in tighter and frankly more effective form. No random appearance of immersion breaking over powered mary sues and the rest, just a slog fight of actual avengers and superheros working together for a single goal because it's necessary, and not because some over powered character feels some kind of sick amusement at watching everyone else do most of the work. What could have been a perfect two part send off is marred by this modern faddish politics being inserted into all entertainment to its detriment, hopefully this will all soon pass and simply will be remembered as a strange marker of its times."
4254,"The almost 3 hours flew by with great writing and effects, and the change of the characters lives made it that much more entertaining - especially Thor! Better than I expected, and a wee bit better than the last film imo. 9/10"
4255,I was so disappointed with this film. There was perhaps 10 minutes of entertainment in this bloated three hour picture. Without spoiling the film there are character changes that I didn't appreciate with respect to Thor and the Hulk. Overall it was not a good ending to this franchise; the plot used elements of convenience and was confusing. However the positive is the chemistry between these characters is still the reason for watching these films. To highlight some of the relationships would spoil the picture.
4256,What an incredible way to put a closure to this amazing story. I really couldn't ask for a better ending. Thank you for all of you who make this movie happens.
4257,"That began roughly a decade ago. Avengers: Endgame is a fantastic love letter to fans of the MCU that brings more heart and fan service to the table, and maybe even a more satisfying ending, though I must admit that I got choked up a few times (didn't cry though, just barely). It's such a great close to several chapters in the MCU. As far as criticism goes. The only little drawbacks were that it doesn't quite match Infinity War's shock value and mind boggling action and that the movie's sci-fi plot device created some logical plot holes. I'll oeavitnatnthat, because I'm not posting spoilers and on balances I thought Endgame was awesome."
4258,Just watched it and I can't explain how much I enjoyed the film without giving too much away. It will have you hooked from the first scene and you will leave the cinema with a deep gratitude to Marvel. I loved it for a million and one reasons. I am so glad I didn't read any reviews on the film as everything that happened completely took me by surprise. Watch it and marvel.
4259,"What can I say. Avengers: Endgame is a masterpiece, it's flawless. It makes you laugh and cry, while providing edge of your seat action! The best marvel movie and superhero movie to date! It will take a long time for a movie to be as good as Avengers: Endgame is!"
4260,"Feeling after watching Avengers: End Game it feels like riding a roller coster, mixed with stir like fruit ice with sweet, sour, bitter, etc. All film critics in Hollywood have given a thumbs up to this one Marvel film. 3 hours made crying, laughing, then crying again.[換行字元][換行字元]The interesting thing is, all the theories that emerged after the shooting photos circulated were mostly happening. Although the theories came true but did not make this film bland and predictable.[換行字元][換行字元]Movie story Avengers: End Game is for fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and for the superhero itself. Epic ending, a character that is always mature and consistently making the movie Avengers: This End Game deserves a high score.[換行字元][換行字元]This year maybe the geeks will part ways with Game of Thrones Season 8, Star Wars and the Avengers team. However, in the future there will be many superhero films that already have high standards. Especially now that DC has shown its fangs. Marvel, don't let the performance drop. Moreover, there are still many who want to be worked on."
4261,"After the devastating conclusion of last year's bombastic Avengers: Infinity War, the remaining Avengers who were fortunate enough to survive the 'Thanos Snap' (in which half the population were reduced to ashes) find themselves in a position they've never before found themselves: defeated. Thanos succeeded in his mission to restore balance, leaving all those who survived to mourn those they tragically lost. With the mad titans whereabouts unknown, the Avengers devise a plan to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet in order to bring back everyone they lost. Meanwhile, Tony Stark (Downey Jr) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) remain adrift in space with oxygen and food gradually running out, along with their hope of somehow being rescued.[換行字元][換行字元]Joe and Anthony Russo (directors of previous MCU entries The Winter Soldier and Civil War) had a monumental task on their hands. Infinity War was staggeringly ambitious, but Endgame serves as the conclusion of The Infinity Saga, a 22-film epic that began with Iron Man in 2008. With so many character arcs and storylines to bring to a satisfying conclusion, it's an absolute wonder that the Russo Brothers pull it off as spectacularly as they do, because Avengers: Endgame certainly delivers a fantastic finale worthy of the 11-year journey.[換行字元][換行字元]Picking up not too long after the shocking events of Infinity War, Endgame reintroduces our beaten heroes in a sombre state of mourning, marking a dramatic shift in tone when compared to the action-packed openings of the previous Avengers films. It isn't all despairing gloom, however, as the traditional MCU humour that has been present in every entry of the series thus far is carefully sprinkled throughout, creating a carefully constructed balance between solemn drama and light hearted comic relief. Fortunately, neither one of those elements overshadow the other. With a film of such a broad canvas (running at a precise 3 hours, the longest MCU instalment to date), Endgame serves as a greatest hits montage of sorts, highlighting various plotlines and memorable moments of previous instalments, resulting in a film that provides an overwhelming tidal wave of fan service. This, of course, is no bad thing, and what's commendable about the whole ordeal is that the plot never gets lost in the noise.[換行字元][換行字元]Just like Infinity War, the film crams in an army of diverse characters. An inevitable factor of the film is that a select few of this mighty ensemble are shuffled off to the side-lines, but the core focus of Endgame are the original six Avengers that started it all, and rightfully so. Iron Man, Captain America (Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Johansson), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) take centre stage here, and the film very much feels like a glorious celebration of their time in the MCU and an emotional goodbye to their iconic characters that many have grown up with over the past 11 years. As their sprawling character arcs come to their satisfying conclusions, it's difficult not to feel the emotional weight of it all, and Endgame packs more than its fair share of gut punches. One of the more underutilized characters of the MCU is undoubtably Gillan's Nebula, but here she is thrust into the spotlight on several occasions, highlighting the complex journey that Nebula has taken throughout her time in this cinematic universe, from one dimensional side-note villain, to one of the most complex and emotionally rich characters we've seen so far.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame's triumphant third act is an absolute marvel to behold. It's an explosive, chaotic battle between good and evil that crams so much magnificent spectacle in every single frame that it's almost impossible to take it all in on first viewing. What the Russo's capture during this final conflict is a comic book fans dream come true, with top tier cinematography by Trent Opaloch. It all leads to a staggeringly awesome yet emotional climax that will undoubtably go down in history as one of the most iconic moments in comic book cinema.[換行字元][換行字元]The MCU revolutionised the comic book movie, cementing their place in pop culture and even captured the imaginations of those who may have never before read a comic book in their lives. Comic book movies today are what spaghetti westerns were in the 60's and 70's, and it seems as though the MCU still has many more stories to tell in the years ahead. Endgame ultimately delivers a worthy ending, concluding The Infinity Saga in an epic fashion. It's visually brilliant, emotionally driven, and is the MCU's greatest achievement yet."
4262,"Speechless...[換行字元][換行字元]I just can't find proper words to describe what I've just watched..... I just wanna say thank you and congratulations for all the ones involved in this epic, masterpiece, production... billions stars couldn't grade this movie...👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Uow, I've just found the words!"
4263,"I love the ending for each characters. And only hate Captain Mavel, she tried to act like a ""super man"" who does not care about anyone or anything, and with a mind of teenager, she willing to jump into the enemy without thinking. Great job! I wish the film does not have her."
4264,"This is now my all time favourite movie... and it is a very weird reason why. Not a regular reason, like objectively speaking, story, characters, meaning etc. etc.. It is my favourite movie because i have never felt such a connection with what was happening on screen. It is the absolute culmination of the MCU, of 11 years of building something so huge that it needs no introduction anymore. I felt respected as a fan while also being given an absolute masterpiece that in my opinion ended in the right and simbolical way. I have went through every single emotion and feeling in this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]And the final reason why i am putting this as my favourite movie: *I have never in my life cried out of PURE JOY, it was always accompanied by other reasons or emotions up until now.

4265,They throw everything and the kitchen sink and it is boring.[換行字元][換行字元]The story is so convoluted and starts as a Telemundo famiiy drama before becoming a mess of coincidences.

4267,"No words to describe the fabulous Endgame. Perfectly pictured finale, brought all pieces together, mixed with action, comedy, emotion, all what you want in an entertainer. All the characters have done their part. 11 years of awesomeness is very well concluded in this massive movie. It's big. I'll have to watch again. Just finished the midnight show."
4268,"I went wanting to enjoy this movie as much as everyone seemed to. I have to admit, the story was rushed a bit. Understandably, they had many big characters to squeeze in the movie...but so was infinity war and that story was more straightforward. Its a good movie, but a few bits wont make sense and i think it would have been better to make two 120min movies instead of compiled 3 hour movie. One last note, the you wont see the ending coming and out of all the theories about what will happen, only one was right..."
4269,"Not much to say other than without a doubt the best Marvel movie made to date! A fantastic, emotional, well scripted film that will leave you feeling fulfilled.....but with also a couple of unanswered questions! I can't say anymore than go watch this film!"
4270,It worth Watching It makes you 😢 Iron-man to endgame

4273,"A movie I feel like I've been waiting an eternity only for it to be a mild disappointment. I'm a huge fan of Marvel comics and have followed the movies with anticipation without any real misses. This was suppose to be the ultimate climax and while there were some nice twists it was in danger of unraveling, but they did just manage to hold it together. The final scenes are very good and ties up the story nicely, but it doesn't excuse the previous 3 hours of ass-numbing tedium"
4274,I watched the movie twice so that I can give a proper review and get clarity on my thoughts . The first time watching the movie was a rollercoaster ride but the second time around I could appreciate it much more ... Yes there are many flaws in the movie without a doubt but it gives an amazing closure to most of our beloved characters. Joy and sadness ....
4275,Sorry to break it to you guy but give this masterpiece of centuries a low score doesn't make you cool. This is the best movie you will probably ever seen but sadly some people don't have eye.
4276,Everything I wanted to see and what I never could dream that would be possible. I expected something great and it was an epic movie
4277,"I swear to God, this is the best superhero movie I have ever seen. Tons of surprising moments. I was screaming in the hall.. I was thrilled.. just want to say, thank you Russo Brothers for this amazing unforgettable experience.. this is the best.. and thank you to all the actors, the members, the crews who are involved in it..I love you 3000.."
4278,"After this we could all learn a few thing about quantum mechanic. Poor Thanos! In one moment I felt like it is unfair match up. So many of them and so few of his man. That's what you get when you mess with the humans of the planet earth. I would really like to avoid spoiling because this is something you just need to see to believe. Most epic battle in the history of superhero movies and series. Twisted and tangled story line which you must carefully follow from the beginning to the end. Story that sums up this whole franchise, this masterpiece of Marvel's story telling. They took us on an amazing journey and reminded us on many great moments from previous movies. You will laugh, you will cry, you will cheer and applause, you will ask yourself what now, sitting there waiting for the post credits scene just to realize there is no one because 'Part of the Journey is the End'!"

4281,Hands down the best avenger movie ive seen! A really epic movie to end the era! 10/10 all day long
4282,"As the title says. You know you have reached a dead end when you introduce time travel to resolve things. It works fine in shows that focus on it like Quantum Leap or Sliders but its usually a sign that you cant write worth a darn if you bring it into something else. That and alternate universes etc. They have been done to death and back and are just a plot device to overcome bad writing.[換行字元][換行字元]So anyway, I still gave this a 5 because the CGI and fight scenes were fun. Unfortunately, that is about all there is to say about this movie. It was pretty hollow. The only source of comedy came with the introduction of smart hulk who was just funny conceptually more than anything else. Otherwise, I actually thought that this movie made all the other movies worse because... time travel...[換行字元][換行字元]Its a shallow movie. Not worthy of its rating in the least."
4283,How did I not recognize Karen Gillan as nebula !! Funny at times otherwise kinda ridiculous
4284,Littel story problems ... Can be more reasonable . but I like it❤
4285,"Endgame and Infinity War are pretty much on the same level in terms of entertainment. And that level is not very high. Look, there's no magic. The first Avengers movie had it along with many of the other firsts in the group. But that magic has gone away. First off, please don't hit us over the head with the emotion hammer. You did this by trying to lengthen out shots where characters look into the distance... for 10 seconds OR look at each other and hug 5 times. What was 3hrs could have been easily 2.5hrs with a little slice of that here or there. Overall, you're seeing the film for the characters you love... you're almost forced to if you're a comic book fan. If you're not a fan - don't bother."
4286,"Wile it does have time plot holes, it is still a AMAZING MOVIE. It is amazingly sad. It deserves to be the highest grossing movie ever. And absolute need to see!!!"
4287,As a big fan of the MCU I knew I would enjoy this movie. What I didn't realize was how much more Endgame is than just an action movie! There were a LOT of laughs and many more tears than I was prepared for. It was long and overly dramatic in many parts but what a ride!!
4288,"Usually I never comment on IMDB but Avengers Endgame is so convincing that I never stop myself to say something about it. You're doing a great job Man,Keep it up."
4289,"The more you think about this film after seeing it, the more perfect you realise this film is to end off the collection of Marvel films. You will laugh, cry and have a whirlwind of emotions but if you're invested in Marvel at all, you MUST see this film."
4290,"Overall this was a good movie. Character screen time was definitely not split as well as the last outing. Just seemed like a long build up for a poorly lit end battle. Again, a good show but not up to the standard that I have grown to expect for Marvel."
4291,"We were never going to see something radical at this stage. it's a very entertaining move but it's not as good as Infinity War ( or Thor Ragnarok). As the summation of a long story arc it works well enough. But there are so many characters here that it's impossible to give anyone real depth. Most appear as cameos more or less. The one thing i felt at the end was that it was over stuffed. The last battle which aims at total spectacle suffers from this surfeit of characters. There were a few occasions in the film where i felt like i had missed something. Particularly the introduction of Captain Marvel. I haven't seen the standalone so maybe i am missing a chunk. She just seemed to come out of nowhere and seemed out of place. And the Hulk stuff was off for me ( the protracted 'selfie' scene is a good example'). The treatment of the Hulk character was also a bit of a fail in the Infinity War movie imo. Thor has a beer belly and is an alcoholic? that was a fail for me. Where did that beer-belly go? Some of the humor is a little off in places although the new 'Banner Hulk' trying to get into character in the jaunt to New York was very funny and naturalistic. Infinity War also had a great focus on the Thanos character whereas here he gets very little time and regressed to a pretty standard comic book villain. All that being said, there was a need to have resolution ( as i understand it) and it would have been failing if it didn't try to please as many as possible. it's a hard film to overly criticize. It's a comic book superhero movie. Just not a truly great one. As a resolution it does it's job. Oh, and the visuals are fantastic : )"
4292,"Endgame is a good movie. There is a lot of quality. But after all the hype and the excellent ""Infinity War"" I probably expected too much.[換行字元][換行字元]What I liked: The actors did a great job, esp. Robert Downey Junior. The screentime of Captain Marvel was reduced to a tolerable minimum. Our original heroes all get their moments to shine. Humor was hit and miss but mostly it worked. The ""Thor is a slob now"" joke was a bit overused though. The end battle is pretty epic.[換行字元][換行字元]What I disliked: There was not enough action and the story drags at times. The Time Travel idea was probably the only way out of the corner the writers had written themselves in after Infinity War and there are also the typical problems/plotholes that come with time travel stories.[換行字元][換行字元]It's not the best MCU movie but I can't dispute its good conclusion."
4293,"It's a great story, and well put together. Though, there was some dead time here and there. One in particular was the support group scene.

4294,Great film and brings the series a a fitting and satisfying conclusion. A must see
4295,"It's a long film at 3 hours the last one being better because this concludes the 10 year story in at great and satisfying way. The first 2 hours are build up that is ultimately paid off but I felt the middle dragged on I just wanted to get to the end. Infinity war kept me interested the whole time, more than endgame. It's definitely worth the whatch and after you don't have to worry about spoilers.8/10."
4296,I am bigest fan of mcu movies and other movies but this movie is my life time favret movie
4297,"Obviously anyone who has spend years watching MCU movies would go to watch Endgame with high hopes. I went with a hope to have a logical but entertaining end to the saga. I was disappointed. These are my impressions: Movie is 3 hour long but 50% of time is wasted on whining actors who have all but given up after their losses (during the previous movie!) Guys, we already know what happened there, now move on. Film makes these heroes pitiful, sad and tired looking humans- Thor is epitome of what I mean. Well, we have enough of those in real lives and we don't show up at 11 pm to watch that! Storyline was silly and predictable. I wanted to see the re-match between Avengers and Thanos but that was poorly done and I don't even understand how it abruptly ended![換行字元][換行字元]Positives were some funny moments."
4298,That movie is absolutely perfect who enjoys the MCU and loved Infinity War.
4299,Truly outstanding !Best Superhero movie ever!!please go watch and enjoy he best cinema The best cinematic expe Rience in a lifetime !!
4300,Amazing movie And a well made ending story That's all I'm gonna say.
4301,"Hi! Not bad... But it could be better! Anyway, Thanks"
4302,"This movie will make u laugh , goose bumps and cry. The plot and the climax is insane. Good jobb Russo brothers for making us feel this way. What a perfect way to end an era. #hatsoff"
4303,"* Why buildup Thor only to tear him to shreds in Endgame? You literally destroyed his brand. * How was Captain Marvel able to locate the ship Tony Stark was on at the beginning of the film? * Why use ""Quantum Realm"" when the majority of the audience will get confused and lost in it? * Why did Captain Marvel say she was going to fight Thanos solo when she, Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man couldn't even take him down without a use of a gauntlet? Is she really that arrogant? * Why was Thanos awesome in the first movie, but became a generic villain in Endgame? * Why did the writers do an awesome job on the infinity war, but fall hard in Endgame? Did someone just tell them, ""let's put all the jokes and scenes you guys want and hopefully it makes sense."" Because that's exactly what it felt like. * Why doesn't doing anything in the past affect the future? It felt so cringeworthy seeing interactions in previous movies that weren't meant to happen. * Why has Thor become Batman of the DC universe? Do directors and producers LOVE destroying characters that we love? Seems like it. * Thor's mother didn't need to be ""trained by witches"" to know that her son Thor was different from her son she saw only moments earlier. So why even bring that up? * Did everyone who ""died"" in infinity war go to a special spirit world of wakanda and just remain there till 5 years later according to spider-man? * Why couldn't have anyone simply put on the gauntlet and wiped out Thanoses army? And why didn't Thanos destroy everybody who was a threat to him in infinity war? * Why did a rat start Endgame by returning ant-man? That seems awfully convenient doesn't it? * How can Captain America pick up Thor's hammer and even use lightning when he couldn't pick it up in the first avengers movie? * Where was Captain Marvel most of the movie? Was she vacationing? * Why was the first hour so slow, The second hour and a half talking about quantum physics that no one understands, and the last 30 minutes of the film fighting when anyone could have simply worn the glove and wiped out thanoses army? * How did Scarlett Witch seemingly become more powerful than even Captain Marvel? * Why didn't anyone save Black Widow when everything else can be done with convenience? Did no one just not want to save her because there was no purpose and it just gave them rage to fight?[換行字元][換行字元]There's a hundred more questions I want to ask, but these are just some of the main ones."
4304,"This is a spoiler free review of Avengers: Endgame. There is a special place in hell for those major outlets that spoiled gigantic plot details that Marvel hid in the advertising. #DontSpoilTheEndgame #ThanosDemandsYourSilence[換行字元][換行字元]To say Avengers: Endgame had to meet lofty heights is an understatement.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is the culmination of the largest cinematic universe ever conceived and one that changed how Hollywood does movies.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame exceeds even the best of expectations.[換行字元][換行字元]The Russo Brothers have cemented themselves that the true masters of superhero films. These directors have perfected the formula; a beautiful balance of characters, heart, action, drama, and passion. I don't think anyone else could have made a film like Endgame without it falling apart under the weight of all the pieces stacked on top of each other.[換行字元][換行字元]The climactic tale of Endgame is relatively simple for a 3-hour behemoth. Following the events of Avengers: Infinity War, where the Mad Titan Thanos killed half of all life in the universe, the surviving Avengers do everything they can to reverse Thanos' climactic snap. What follows is a 3 hour love letter to the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and one that sees some storylines end and leads to new possibilities in others. To say more is to spoil part of the surprise of the film.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame was filmed back-to-back with Infinity War and it's clear to me that Endgame is where the emotional heart of the Infinity Saga is was placed. There are many moments in this film that will bring you to tears. Moments that any fan of the MCU will cheer for. Moments that no other franchise could ever hope to attain.[換行字元][換行字元]This is probably the most emotionally vulnerable we've seen many of the heroes of the MCU. We see what it's like for our heroes that helped define a generation to have failed despite everything they tried. There's a sense of sadness and desperation throughout Endgame that no MCU film has ever maintained for so long. This is not to say that Endgame is a sad movie; Endgame is a very adult movie and is one that any fan of the MCU will need to see.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is a roller coaster of a movie in so many ways. There are moments of levity, moments of fist-pumping action, and then moments of complete sadness that might bring tears to your eyes. It delivers everything. It never flinches. It will affect you in every way a well-made film can.[換行字元][換行字元]Performances are across the board fantastic. Thanos still reigns as the best MCU villain and Brolin's performance as man/monster who has the absolute conviction to do what he sees as necessary and the power to achieve it is beyond terrifying. Due to the increased run-time and Thanos' actions in Infinity War we get to spend a lot more time with our core Avengers group and have those moments that Infinity War lacked. While some of the supporting characters don't get as much time to shine, Endgame is really about the emotional turmoil of the original Avengers and how they deal with a world where they lost. This is where the heart of Endgame is and what makes Endgame not just another superhero team-up film. Endgame is a deeply personal story. These are actors doing right by the characters they portray, and doing right by the fans that adore them for it.[換行字元][換行字元]Oh and of course the action is fantastic and on a scale that may never be topped. While Infinity War might have been more action-packed by nature of it being a, well, war film, Endgame is more focused on the character moments that lead up to the climax that we all have waited a decade to see. The sheer spectacle that is the final act of Endgame is worth the price of admission alone. So many moments in the final act will have any MCU fan screaming on the inside with joyous ovation that will make them hardly be able to contain themselves. I am not kidding when I say this: the dude next to me at the theatre was literally bouncing up and down throughout the climax.[換行字元][換行字元]Perhaps the only slight I have against Endgame is that it's a film that would be next to impossible to fully appreciate for anyone who hasn't seen the entirety of the MCU. There are moments in this film that reference pretty much every single MCU movie made. Most references are quiet ones to some of the more iconic scenes in previous MCU films; the more drawn out ones are fully explained in the film to let newcomers follow along. Endgame is best appreciated by the die-hard Marvel fans, but is still approachable for those who have only caught their more popular films.[換行字元][換行字元]I could go on and on about why Endgame is excellent but I must resist the urge to as it might spoil the surprises. Endgame is truly a unique film experience; an epic follow-up to Infinity War that finishes what that movie started, as well as acts as a nigh-perfect ending to over a decade's worth of cinema. While the MCU will continue with heroes new and old, Endgame is the point where we will look back at as a monument to the right way to end a story on a scale which previously was never even dreamed of.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers: Endgame is the rare film that will make you cheer at the top of your lungs and make you cry just a few moments later. A film that has laughs while also having deeply reflective and somber scenes. Avengers: Endgame is a thrilling, heartfelt, and fitting climax that is almost impossible not to love."
4305,Very satisfying ending! Nuf said - I don't want to risk any spoilers
4306,An epic conclusion..An unforgettable experience.The movie starts the right way..It says goodbyes and hellos.it keeps you in your seat with moments that catches your breath.
4307,"A good movie with great action, especially in the end. The film was a nice ending for the avengers films and has to win an oscar. I am a Hawkeye fan and was very happy that he had a lot to do in the movie, he was very cool. But not every movie is perfect, the beginning went way too fast for me and there was not enough buildup for the first part of the movie I think. Go see it and decide for yourself, you're going to enjoy it."
4308,"So I've never written a review before but thought this deserved it. Before watching this I found myself wondering how this movie would play out, how it would all work. Let me tell you, it all worked and in a way I never imagined it would. The story was just so perfect. It had everything, from laughter to sadness and pure awe inspiring satisfaction. The ending was probably perfect. I was literally sitting in my seat with my mouth open from amazement from what I was watching. I truly believe this movie deserves an Oscar for best picture."
4309,"Avengers Endgame, brought the perfect end to series of blockbusters that have previously been released. It elapsed every predecessor film made and once again The Russo brothers created another masterclass filled with witty humor, thrilling battle actions and tear jerking moments. This film is definitely one of the best evermade and to rival the Nolan's Masterpiece ""The Dark Night"""
4310,First half is boring AF and movie is so overhyped.
4311,A few niggles aside this was pretty much a perfect end to the original cast and crew. How Marvel follows this up? Its going to be a big effort and from the current trend bowing to PC pressures I believe a big tail off in fan interest may happen.[換行字元][換行字元]Hope I am wrong but if not this films will stand as an amazing legacy.
4312,I was bored throughout this movie. 1. Nothing really happens for most of the movie and there are so many unnecessary long scenes. 2.There is one really good fight/ action sequence. 3. THEY DID THOR SO WRONG. I watched Infinity war the night before and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. With endgame I was looking at my phone the whole time hoping something would happen.
4313,"Saw Endgame twice yesterday! The action, the humour, the drama, the emotions are off the charts! Epic doesn't even comes close when talking about this Marvel of a superhero movie! Avengers Assemble!"
4314,"I had such big expectations for this movie and i was so anxious to see it that in the past two weeks i kept dreaming and thinking about it every day. But, unfortunetly, the movie dissapointed me pretty much. I really like the Ruso brothers and they have had great imagination and are good at what they do, but this movie was casted and filmed in a hurry with little to almost no action at all and lack of inspiration and imagination. They could have done a much better job with the Endgame movie but i guess that is what happens when you rush to make even more money and don't care much about the fans. Hope they make it up to us with their next movie."
4315,"What a journey! Well and truly the greatest comic book movie of all time. In fact, it's one of the greatest movies in cinematic history. Bravo Marvel, I love you 3000. PS, Ignore the 1 and 5 star reviews, they're fake."
4316,Infinity War left the MCU in a devastated stated and Endgame picks right up where it left off. The story of Endgame is a patient one like the MCU has been throughout the last 11 years and slowly windes you through the rabbit hole. The emotions you go through are from funny to sad and out right stressful. Great story overall and some of the best batch of acting in the entire MCU and by all parties involved. Wonderfully directed by the Russo Brothers. I as a fan can't thank them enough and especially to Kevin Feige for making the MCU what it is which in my opinion one of the best executions of a film franchise ever. This was a clear cut plan to give us the fans a slow and intimate story that began Iron Man and still continues. Thank you Stan Lee. You were the best and will be very missed. We love you and I tip my cap to everyone involved in the MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]With all this being said I'm going to go see it again.
4317,"Endgame was a phenomenal movie it had so much emotion, jokes as usual and that final fight!!! That fight was incredible I love you 3000 marvel and I can't wait for what you're going to do in phase 4"
4318,"OMG! ""Avengers: Endgame"" is absolutely Amazing, Epic, Brilliant, Masterpiece, and it's way more fun and better than Infinity War, like every Audience and I thought it would be. It had all the action, humor, and had very emotional scenes. The Russo Brothers, did way better than Joss Whedon. Why? Because, it's ""A must see"" and a perfect Marvel Studios film, for the whole entire audience to watch, but I Can't tell you what happens, or what happens in the end or who's coming back to life, because in the end of ""Avengers: Endgame"", no one, and I mean no one, or anyone, can guess what's gonna happen :) And Now it's shattering Box Office Records around the World! :) I loved it 3000 :) and it's far better than the first Avengers movie, and Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Avengers: Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you, Marvel, Kevin Feige, The Russo Brothers, and most of all, Thank you, Stan Lee."
4319,"I was so convinced this movie wouldn't live up to the hype. I was very worried that it was going to be predictable and too cliche, but I obviously underestimated the amazing team behind the avengers movies. In summary it's a great movie made in a great franchise made by one of the best movie studios."
4320,"Avengers endgame was as awesome a movie as it was build up to be, the ending of the movie was great and just as well, with some sort of normalcy being restored. Personally, I believed that this particular movie was a tad on the slower side during it build-up part, but after the intermission it build up major pace, with moments after moments that would make you clap and keep you in the edge of the seat. The actions sequences were beyond awesome and the storyline was justified. Even for a person not previously exposed to the MCU this movie is good throwback. The ending yes, a just one and I'll leave it up to you to invoke your personal emotions for it."
4321,As with all time travel themed movies there are huge contradictions and holes in the plot of this movie - it is well made and most storylines come to some sort of satisfying conclusion - it all gets a little bit Politically Correct and cringe at the end but a decent movie - not as good as Infinity War in my opinion
4322,"It's the most amazing and most ambitious mile stone in movie history of mankind. This movie unite people than any movies ever will. I see all my friends, my family, even my co-workers every age, gender and color go to this movie together like no movie ever did before. This is one unique movie experience and ever will be."
4323,I loved endgame (the first time at least) I think it was the best ending for the 3rd phase of the mcu. I'm really excited for phase 4 of the mcu already
4324,Infinity war was best of the 2.[換行字元][換行字元]Kind of a slow movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Thor and hulk were no shows. Thor gets fat and hulk gets an arm cast. Hahaha[換行字元][換行字元]Captain marvel was good because we rarely see her. She had a good moment tho[換行字元][換行字元]Best scene was the loss heroes returning[換行字元][換行字元]Its a fine movie but lackluster for its hype
4325,What an ending to an era of Marvel movies. There are scenes when your heart goes out to the characters. The story starts out slowly but catches momentum and by the end you are gripping your seats in anticipation. And it is beautiful how each character is given space and importance. Truly an epic movie which all Marvel fans will cherish...even the end credits.... What a way to close the movie.
4326,The movie does some injustice to one or two characters but on a whole it is an epic conclusion. Alot more than like a hell lot more than you can imagine is contained in these 3 hours. Believe me it is the movie of the decade!!!
4327,Should had a 3000 stars rating. Awesome movie the best one I've watched.
4328,I'm very like this movie... This film presents extraordinary action from all heroes at marvel
4329,"For 11 years marvel has been building up for their epic finale and it is almost safe to say they nailed it With an emotional roller-coaster, breathtaking soundtracks and epic scenes and fight sequences that will be the standard against which all the upcoming movies of this genre is held, Marvel delivered the superhero movie of the decade However, the plot felt a little forced as they were constantly trying to provide the perfect finale - which they almost did -, they filled the movie with plot drivers to reach the epic peak of Marvel cinematic universe But all in all I can safely say that it's one of the best movies I've ever seen and it can probably withstand the test of time as people at different times can sit at the edges of their seats as they see the ""AVENGERS ASSEMBLE""."
4330,Marvel Avengers Endgame is a combination of 10 years of Film making. It is viewed by many critics as been a top film of the year. Went to see it for Tom Vaughan Lawler as he is a great Irish actor. We see ups and downs. Like most comic book movies it falls flat in the final third of the film. If you are taking your kids to see it don't three hours is a lot for children and trust me they won't sit still. To conclude Endgame is the Endgame for cinematic crossovers possibly
4331,It was an amazing ending. Thank you for all the years and experiences that the Marvel Universe gave me. It was emotional to see that these guys may not be on screen together anymore but I belive that a new generation will come
4332,"Just when you think that they couldn't make a movie worse than Doctor Strange, they throw this at you. It's an action move that tries too hard, way too hard to be complex, and then fails at it spectacularly.[換行字元][換行字元]Ignore the terrible attempts at humor, and the extremely useless first hour, even then it felt way too long. It's not like the cast is bad, there are good actors in there, but either they are never utilized or are given such flimsy characters that I don't know who I hated more; the actor for taking that role or the character for being that bland.[換行字元][換行字元]Oh and the more-than-obvious-from-a-million-light-years-away attempt of shoving feminism and racial equality down your throat. It looks awful and felt like they were making fun and not supporting it. Like they wanted to cover all bases and earn the most points, from their grandest money-cow. Absolutely ridiculous![換行字元][換行字元]Also the video game ad? It's The Secret Life of Walter Mitty all over again.[換行字元][換行字元]And the story? Well, there's no point to it.

4333,"In my point of view this is the best movie MCU ever create Russo brothers make this awesome, hope they can make a better one tomorrow"
4334,Totally worth a watch and it caps the series off well but it's pacing is a bit erratic for my tastes.[換行字元][換行字元]It'll be interesting to see what comes in the new phases. I won't say more because this movie deserves to have none of the secrets spoiled.[換行字元][換行字元]Go see it guys.
4335,"If you want to watch some visual eye candy, forget about character development, and story writing. Even throw away consistency and continuity, then be relieved when its over, then this is for you.[換行字元][換行字元]Too many fan boys and sheep, following bought and paid for critic reviews. Good films have given way, to basically some pretty images smashed together, and so simplified yet terribly written scripts, that it basically makes no sense in even how the writers wrote it. I'm shocked and applaud at the good reviews for this.[換行字元][換行字元]P.s. Diploma in film and television, and a degree in creative writing"
4336,"Great story telling with heaps of humor, make this movie very enjoyable. i think its the most enjoyable marvel movie after infinity wars. bit tears too t.t"
4337,"I watched this film yesterday and am still talking about how good it is - I laughed alot, I cried even more... I cannot understand how it got any less than a 9 in the user reviews. Absolutely stunning, beautiful end to a longggg series."
4338,"What can I say this movie is amazing, it blew my mind and my expectations. If this movie doesn't receive Oscars I will be surprised.... I went to the double screening of Infinity Wars and End Game. I'm just home, tired but still amazed. The Russo brothers are beyond legendary... they need to be given a Star Wars franchise immediately. Can't wait to see it again."
4339,"Superhero films have become increasingly popular in recent years, and Marvel Studios has created another blockbuster film to add to their list. Avengers: Endgame is an instant hit, bringing back the amazing cast from the previous Marvel films, including Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, and many others. With incredible direction from the iconic Russo Brothers, the movie doesn't fail to come alive and fully immerse the audience.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie follows a distraught Avengers following their loss at the hands of the tyrannical Thanos. Worse yet, their longtime ally, Tony Stark, is lost at space, aimlessly drifting with fading hope for return.

The phrase ""Whatever it takes"" has never had more precedence than now.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is an amazing movie in its merit, with powerful emotional acting from every actor included in the roster. However, its strongest features come from its placement as the follow up from its predecessor, Infinity War.

4343,I've always been a fan of comics either DC or marvel i was fan of both and supported both sides but to be honest The MCU is way better than the DCEU dont get me wrong but DC got a good future as i saw in aquaman and shazam but to see how all these 22 movies of the MCU just connect and reach its peak is just pure gold a great ending to a great era and i just can't wait what the phase 4 is going to bring us
4344,"Avengers: Endgame (SPOILER FREE) Review:[換行字元][換行字元]After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to undo Thanos' actions and restore order to the universe. Avengers: Endgame is literally one of, is not the, most anticipated film ever. This review is probably going to be shorter since its spoiler free and I have to be vague. I should have a spoiler review up soon (Monday is apparently the day we can talk about the spoilers according to the Russo Brothers). So this is a little late. I saw it last week Saturday and just saw it again last night. I wanted to see if it had the same effect as it did on first viewing. I'm pleased to say that I absolutely loved this film and even more than Infinity War. It's a great story that brings all 22 films in the Infinity Saga to a bittersweet end. The plot is much darker than any Marvel film. The first act was a drama where they're all realizing the events of what happened and it gets a good perspective for the audience. We saw in Infinity War that it affected the superheroes and some people but it makes us all think of the entire universe. It's tragic really. This is also when we get the most character development in any of the films. We see their true feelings. Now I could go on and on about how there wasn't a single bad performance by anyone, but I would like to talk about one. I'm currently on the petition that Robert Downey Jr. should get an Oscar nomination or at least a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. I believe this is his peak performance and he put all his emotions into it. The scenes at the beginning and end are his best though. Some brought me to tears. It's a very emotional film and I don't know how one could go in to it with at least tearing up. So Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, amazing job with the script. No line felt out of place. Everything came off natural. And also the Russo Brothers did their finest work directing and they're some of the best right now. There's so much to say about those but that's all I can say without giving it away. Now for the technical aspects. Alan Silvestri's score was interesting and beautiful because it had the original melodies like the previous Avengers films but this time he created new melodies that, for me at least, are just as memorable as the Avengers Theme. Also my favorite score of the year so far. The visual effects were good as usual and worked well with the chaos of the action, especially the final battle. Speaking of battles some say you could leave for the action since it's all the same and there was too much going on, but I strongly disagree. There is no time to get up and leave during this film. The cinematography was at its best of the franchise with Trent Opaloch as the cinematographer. And I think I'll leave my review at that. For more content I will have my spoiler review soon. I think this was an amazing film that brings the series all together. I'm pleased to say I liked it more than Infinity War and it's my favorite film of the year just beating Us. Therefore this is my first perfect film of the year. Please go see it if you haven't. I think this film is special and one you can never forget.[換行字元][換行字元]My Grade: A+"
4345,"The best film of this decade, every character paid off, such a icon story. Will be talked about for years"
4346,"Every marvel movie in the history gives us the best feeling as a fan since the beginning. There are times that it will give you sadness and happiness. But, being a marvel fan changes every aspect and perspective of one's life. It gives inspiration and motivation to the people who needs it and to those people who's strugging in life.[換行字元][換行字元]AVENGERS: ENDGAME - A final masterpiece to all marvel fans. It will give you mixed emotions, sadness, happiness then go back to sadness then happiness again and sadness. It's like a rollercoaster ride watching this epic conclusion. I don't really know what to say, i just felt SPEECHLESS after watching it. I cried for like 5 times in the cinemas and at home. I really can't get over it, just wanted to cry the whole time. I love everything about this film and it surpass all of my expectations and it is SOLID, EPIC AND A MASTERPIECE. No doubt, this is a movie of the year and the best movie of our history. Also, i am planning on watching it again because it's worth everytime and every moment of your life so i'm highly recommending it to everyone not just to all marvel fans, but to those people who wants to experience the best cinematic moment. Lastly, ENDGAME is EVERYTHING no dull moments, it is epic and solid, i have no doubt just love everything. Plus the cast and characters are the BEST, I REALLY LOVE THEM SO MUCH. THANK YOU AVENGERS! THANK YOU TO THE DIRECTORS AND TO ALL THE STAFFS! THANK YOU MARVEL FOR THIS EPIC AND SOLID MOMENT TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. YOU ARE ALL ALWAYS IN MY HEART FOREVER AND EVER. ONCE AGAIN, THANK YOU!"
4347,"I just loved it.... absolutely! A walk down memory lane in the best of ways... that 3 hours went like a ""snap of the fingers""... there were tears and there were cheers and then there was finality!!! Goodbye to The Avengers as we knew them... and loved them"
4348,The best movie of all time. I would like it If it was longer den 3 hours.
4349,This is the first time I watching the premiere movie.
4350,"This movie is beyond expectations, you'll cry sometimes, you'll scream sometimes, you'll feel angry sometimes. truly, its an unforgettable experience and I urge any person to see it."
4351,"This movie is no less than a work of art. The Russo brothers made a very fitting end to the avengers story. The acting is excellent, the CGI is top notch, and the climax of the movie is epic.[換行字元][換行字元]With that said, I must also despise the Russo Brothers. You know what you did."
4352,"After eleven years and twenty-one movies, the Endgame is finally here and I must say it's everything it should be. With a massive runtime of three hours, ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) rarely feels like it wastes a second. In regards to its runtime, each hour of the movie does have its own sort of beginning, middle, and end along with its own themes. The first hour of the movie really hits hard as a sort of drama hot off the events of ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) and I could see how it might be a tad boring if you didn't watch all the previous movies leading up to this one, but for those of you that did it's amazing to watch our heroes fighting a battle that they can't suit up for. Things truly get interesting however in the second hour of the movie, which plays off as more of a thriller reminiscent of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014). There are some great action sequences here, but most of the excitement comes from the high stakes, suspense, and a happy serving of fan service. Last but not least, the final act of the movie. The last hour of ""Endgame"" is everything you could ever want for the epic conclusion of this franchise. Superb action scenes, inspiring moments, and some of the best character exchanges you could ever hope to see. From beginning to end, you can tell the people at Marvel Studios really gave it their all on this one. Robert Downey Jr continues and surpasses expectations with Iron Man, whose arc in this movie hits home on so many levels. Chris Evans, on the other hand, takes the spotlight in this movie with his Captain America, once again we get to see his symbol of all that is good try to find hope in the aftermath of a devastating loss. It should also be noted that while Iron Man and Captain America both have incredible arcs throughout the movie, it is possible Thor that has the best arc of the entire MCU both in and out of universe. Watching as his character learns what it means to be worthy in the first Thor, only to be faced with loss and failure in every movie he's appeared in after might seem harsh but Chris Hemsworth does a terrific job balancing the humor that Taika Waititi added to the character along with the pain that he has experienced. Of course, all of this was possible thanks to the excellent directing of Anthony and Joseph Russo and the oversight of Marvel's very own Kevin Feige who is a Stan Lee for the modern era. As you might be able to tell I found the movie does have a ton of pro's, but that's because it was everything that I could ever hope for after following this franchise since I was nine years old going to see the first ""Iron Man"" (2008) with my dad and brothers. With that said though, like all movies this one does have flaws and most of them just come from the fact that this movie serves more of a love letter to fans than a film shooting for an oscar nomination. While the heroes truly do thrive in this one, Thanos does take a slight step back and in my opinion, caused him to be a slightly less compelling villain when compared to his portrayal in the previous movie. He does, however, get his fair share of amazing scenes, I just didn't find I was as connected to the big bad as I once was. The film's biggest flaw might be the amount of fan service in it. While it's great watching it, and caused me and the rest of my theater to cheer and clap till our hands bruised during the premier, sometimes it felt a little redundant or hung around too long. One such scene happens in the third act of the movie without going into too many details to avoid spoilers, during the final battle there's a massive tease towards the future of the MCU as a certain group of heroes band together. It's an awesome scene and I really look forward to seeing how it pays off, but thanks to the dialogue it comes off as forced and cheesy. It's meant to invoke similar emotions to ""Avengers"" (2012) when we see the heroes band together for the first time in New York, but fails to recognize that that scene was great due to the age-old rule of ""show, don't tell."" All that said, be sure to check the movie out as soon as possible. It's definitely meant to be seen on a large screen with loud surround sound speakers, but be aware you might not enjoy it as much if you haven't seen all the other movies. Overall I would give it an 8.5/10 and a ranking of Marvelous."
4353,"Wow what a ending. We knew this was gonna be good bye for a few of our favorite heros but what a way to say bye. You won't even notice the length of the movie, the story keeps rolling and even the slow moments are good. Will definitely see this again and highly recommend this incase you were thinking of not going."
4354,Unfortunately after all the hype leading up to the movie I was rather disappointed. Infinity War was always going to be tough to top but was disappointed with Endgame as it felt as a walk down memory lane. The fighting scenes were not as good and they seemed rather one sided. Also was not such a fan of how they changed certain main characters appearance - for the worse in my opinion.
4355,This film is an epic conclusion to the Infinity Saga which started in 2008 with Iron Man. All the 21 films are definitely worth seing together ass a whole for this films characters to work along with their motives and actions. This film is by far the most different from any of the other MCU-films which I found extremely refreshing and entertaining.
4356,Wow it's hands down the best movie I've ever seen....... nothing has been close to this it will make you laugh and cry. Just amazing from start to finish. Nothing will prepare you for it
4357,"Nearly 1000 reviews two days after the release, so you just need the basic information without spoilers.[換行字元][換行字元]It's in my opinion the worst marvel movie I've seen and I've seen all except for the captian marvel movie. I loved the previous avengers movie, which I rated 8 out of 10. I was looking forward to the movie and got disappointed big time.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is slow. I mean really slow. The first 2,5 h you barley see a action scene. It's full of plot holes, which make the movie unbelieveable. I know its fiction but that doesn't mean you can cut all the logic and get away with it. The plot itself was very predictable but there was not much plot left when you take the jokes and the fanservice away. The antagonist was reduced to the absolute minimum. Infinity War build Thanos as the best and complex villain in the MCU, just to turn him into a one dimensional world destroyer. They alter their characters in parodic ways. Some may find it funny but not me. The humor is also a big factor. Infinity War had funny moments but this was a absolute gatling gun fire of unnecessary jokes and none of them hit. The jokes were overdone and they rode the dead horse many times which lead me to hide my face behind my hands for most of the time. Maybe it's just not my kind of humor.[換行字元][換行字元]Sooooo...3h of my lifetime I can't get back. It felt wasted. I was bored, angry and torn between sleeping in the chair or just walking out the cinema."
4358,"After watching all the movies and growing with all the characters, it was the perfect way to end it. I love these movies and I will say that some of them are better then others but this one is by far the best. With out giving anything away this movie checked all the boxes in my book. It had funny moments, it had touching moments, sad moments and most importantly epic moments. There were moments where I actually got excited to the point where a air fist pump happened. There were times where my girlfriend was getting fired up and what not. And she barely follows the movies. But after waiting the whole 10 years to see what would happen, and being rattled that I had to wait this long to see the ultimate conclusion. I couldn't help but think to myself once the movie was over and I was leaving the theatre how a little sad I was that all that waiting was over. But that's because of how amazing the movie was. Obv there are some downfalls to the movie, but honestly very few. I went into the movie with high expectations and it extremely Knocked it out of the park. It met every expectation x100. I will be seeing this movie a few more times in theatres."
4359,Imagine a movie spent 10 years with 20 movies to make.[換行字元][換行字元]How it will be?
4360,"A movie with a great closing, but that has many plot holes the truth is not on par with its predecessor Infiniti war, you should not let yourself be carried away by fanaticism is a good movie but leaves much to be desired"
4361,"I love superhero movies. So consider this a genre I truly enjoy and I review this title considering it's not art; it's entertainment. And in that sense, it's emotional, exciting, dramatic, action packed with the perfect amount of humor. It's no wonder it's the most anticipated superhero movie of all times, and no wonder why it has grossed so much. The movie promised to be awesome and was an understatement. If you like superheroes like me, you're gonna love it. Never before had so many heroes appeared together and, finally, working as a team. Now; to all of the people who expected an art movie, of course you didn't like it. It's an action film with amazing special effects and awesome action scenes and fabulous characters."
4362,"Avengers: Endgame is literally everything you have wanted AND MORE in a Marvel movie. I'm not going to lie, it is slow to get into at the start, but the last hour is the reason I HAD TO give this film a 10/10. Honestly, as everyone has mentioned, it's a culmination of everything good in Marvel. It's beauty, perfection and whatever else you can think of. Endgame lived up to its hype and certain characters truly ended in such an amazing way. You'll never expect ANYTHING. No joke, I am going to have to go watch this again!! 3000% recommended ;-)"
4363,"When Thanos snapped his finger, it shook the world. How could Earth's mightiest heroes avenge the ashen fallen? Could they at all? Would any plan they concoct be plausible, successful, or, most importantly, dramatically satisfying? Now that we're at the Endgame, our fears are meeting the truth, and what a glorious ending it is. This Marvel Universe experiment should've been an unwieldy disaster; just look at what DC failed to do. Producer Kevin Feige has created a hand-wrapped gift to those of us who love epic storytelling. The ""Infinity"" franchise has been a symphonic display of heroism, comedy, pathos and ethos that unbelievably ""concludes"" with its most emotionally substantial film ever. Endgame culminates tears, cheers and years of storytelling into one incomparable piece of epic finale storytelling, the likes of which we're rarely lucky enough to see on the big screen. Unlike most of the Avengers films, the Endgame story lays heavy on its viewers. Dense, long, and somber, it can seem burdensome, until you realize how immaculately constructed and lovingly toned it all is. Each character gets their moment(s), and not just superhero poses and fan service throwaways. They get to be human, making their final standoff not only a battle for the cinematic ages but a heartfelt dramatic timebomb, hearkening recent saga classics like Return of the King or Deathly Hallows. I'm keeping the details light to avoid spoilers, but Endgame is so much more than its individual plot points. The quiet sadness, cheer-worthy action and inspired sparks of humor are too transcendent to be ruined by some words on a digital screen. These superhumans have given us a glorious celebration of the goodness of being human."
4364,"Make no mistake , go and see this movie before you get to know too much , perfect ending and what you can never expect is so much joy accompanied by so much emotional pain followed by fantastic oh I mean fantastic humor we all seem to love so very much, thank you , Hail hydra"
4365,I watched avengers endgame I liked it very much but One thing I don't understand in movie about joe russo.he was in the movie and I don't understand how is it possible if he was dead in captain America civil war....????
4366,Surely I'm not the only one to walk out of the theatre and feel this way? It's not just about the hype. I was bored. It was dull and uninspiring and felt like the Iron Man show. I am a huge Marvel fan as are my two sons and we all left feeling let down. Nonsense about the LGBTV character- this was one of the Russos with a few lines of dialogue in a three hour movie - really!!!! As for the 'female empowerment scene' this felt like a cheesy afterthought. Yes it has answers but it could have been so much more. We left the theatre after Infinity War and rebooted to see it again. I will not be rushing to see this movie again.
4367,I cried at like 4 times.[換行字元][換行字元]Definitely passed the Bechdel test. Woman power!
4368,Just go see it if you're a fan of the other films.
4369,"Couldn't think of a better ending for all these marvel cinematic universe movies over the last decade. It's also an decade where i start from not knowing marvel at all till a big fan of marvel. Get to know and like or dislike all these characters movie by movie and after 10 years watching them is like watch some old friends of yours and your heart just couldn't help to resonance with them. The more marvel movies you saw, the more strongly you can enjoy and connect with these characters in this last one, and the more emotional you will be. And it's not only the characters we grow up with but also these amazing actors . I gotta say i may not be able to like any later versions of avengers as much as this one because they were simply too good and have been there for ten years. With so many sentiments in my heart, i can only say this: i love you 3000."
4370,Casting and CGI is super. Already scenerio is scripet. One word: AWESOME
4371,No spoilers. BEST movie saga wrap-up of ALL TIME! I've never seen a movie that was too good to spoil. It's that good!
4372,"After seeing all the 22 movies and some of them even twice I have to say that the last movie of the MCU was perfectly balanced in every aspect. Full of passion, drama, funny scenes, action... it has it all! An almost flawless scenario that left me stumbled by its depth and ode in logike. This scenario along with the coordination of the Russo Brothers (another proof that brotherhood collaboration excels) truly inspired all actors involved for a great performance. All these years of participations in different movies also enable them all to surpass themselves in acting. That's the success on the MCU in my opinion along with a clearly anthropocentric approach to the character of its heroes .Of course with such an amount of actors playing there will have been some cliques projected more during the film, but their unification under one roof was excellent. Thumbs up also for actor's discretion on leaks on the script.[換行字元][換行字元]To be honest after I watched with much anticipation Avengers Infinity War in which I have to say I expected more in terms of fights among characters like in the comic books (maybe I was biased due to the numerous action-based trailers), I was prepared for a good but not special endgame. But on the contrary as Red Skull would say ""We all think we were prepared.. we were all wrong!""[換行字元][換行字元]A mind elevation for children, a new dimension of sentimental fulfillment for adults..

4373,"Forget people who say that this movie is crap,because the way I see it avengers endgame is the most entertaining movie in history so far."
4374,"One of the best movie going experiences of my life. I've seen every MCU film theatrically (and at least once at home) and this was INCREDIBLY rewarding. Holy smokes. So many great surprises and callbacks. AVOID SPOILERS at all costs. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll sweat.. 3 hours passed by quickly and I cannot wait to see it again! Definitely see as many MCU movies as you can before hand to catch all the amazing call backs."
4375,"This movie is very good. It has great character development and the whole story feels very well written. I'm not a big Marvel fanboy, I just like the movies as they are really easy to watch and always make me feel good. So I'm not the guy to start clapping or cheering in a theatre when some hero enters, but this movie still gave me some goosebumps and made me laugh very often. Two things I don't like are; there are too many oneliners in this movie. Sometimes they just rushed the conversations and made a character say some lame words. At certain points this irritated me. Secondly, I think the first part of the movie is not very good. I was a bit afraid that it wouldn't end up being what I hoped it would be. They fixed this very well in the second part of the movie, but still. The first part is a bit too lame for me. All in all, an incredibly good movie, fans of the franchise will love it, and regular viewers will too. Definitely worth the money to go to the cinema"

4377,"Best superhero movie created ever it has besrt screenplay, story, action and full entertainment like a perfect package"
4378,"Super hyped and still entertained but felt underwhelmed and disappointed. Yet, the writings were on the wall with Cpt Marvel. Nonetheless go watch as this will be the last MCU with still a bit of quality. It is obvious which direction future Marvel films will take and it will not be good. Rest In Peace MCU."
4379,"Time machine was the worst idea ever. I couldn't even understand every inch of the stories, it make no sense to me."
4380,"I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but from my point of view Infinity War is way better than Endgame. I do feel like Endgame tried to copy some great scenes from Infinity War, yet those ones were miserably executed. The only thing amazing about Endgame is Captain Marvel and her new short haircut, but that's about all that shines on Endgame :(. I am really disappointed, I really hoped for something better and not that predictable. Unfortunately Endgame lies in a category of movies for which even the trailer is better than the movie.."
4381,"Endgame is too long. Why is that a problem? Because the length prevents the film from truly soaring to the heights achieved by Infinity War. I love the MCU and was as geeked out as anyone for Endgame, but I have to be honest. So here we go.....[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is largely built around the original 6 Avengers and that's fine to set up the film, however, Endgame takes a VERY long time to get any real momentum. A VERY long time. It isn't until Ant Man arrives that any life is injected into the film. So here are a few let downs in my opinion...[換行字元][換行字元]1. Captain Marvel is little more than a cardboard cutout and the personality she expressed in her movie is nowhere to be found. 2. You will be very disappointed if you enjoy seeing ""Hulk Smash!"" 3. You will be very disappointed if you hope to see much of Black Panther, Loki, Bucky, Nick Fury, Groot, or Gomorrah. 4. The film rarely lets loose the personalities we've all come to enjoy in Rocket, Star Lord, Happy, or even Captain Marvel for that matter.[換行字元][換行字元]Now for some positives:[換行字元][換行字元]1. There are some very good laughs that thankfully lift up the long run time. 2. Its a blast revisiting some moments from past MCU films. 3. It's nice to see the female empowerment themes and the potential set up for the Young Avengers 4. You can go to the restroom without missing something truly crucial. Seriously.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall: Endgame is 30 minutes too long and this prevents the film from achieving a solid and consistent pace. It allows moments where we have to think about the ""science"" behind the action. The emotional highs and lows are simply not as impactful as Infinity War and some serious stuff happens in Endgame. The climax is enjoyable, however we have waited over 2 hours to see if our favorite characters from the extended MCU are going to appear and by this time the climax has to be compressed into a 45 minute ""epic"" battle that is barely on par with the battle of Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]In short, Endgame is inferior to Infinity War. I should have felt deep sadness at times throughout the film and the movie was unable to create that feeling in me. I wanted to feel the same highs I felt with Infinity War, but those highs were few and fleeting.[換行字元][換行字元]It wraps the Avengers MCU in a beautiful box, but when opened, I was underwhelmed. I got my money's worth in sheer length, but that running time was detrimental to my ability to deeply invest.[換行字元][換行字元]Sean"
4382,"I was absolutely speechless. Everything about this movie was incredible. I laughed so hard I cried, and I cried so hard people around me were looking. The plot twists throughout kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The unity of the cast is undeniably one of the best that will ever grace the cinemas again. It was quite literally the 'perfect ending' for the Avengers. Need to rewatch IMMEDIATELY. 10 stars!"
4383,"The first 50 minutes set up the movie very well but the second act lacks urgency and focus. The movie comes to a halt and feels as if it's meandering between scenes, not knowing what to do and not being very entertaining. The movie is also highly predictable and somewhat ruins Thanos's character due to a strange character decision. Iron man is given a lot to work with, which is compelling, same with Hawkeye. The ending is somewhat satisfying but also cringe. Overall it is a fine movie, not offensively bad but certainly not as good as it's predecessor."
4384,"For eleven years we've been gifted with almost two dozen films that were adapted from the massive comic book family of Marvel. I don't think that Jack Kirby and Stan Lee could have possibly imagined that their work and passion could possibly have the effect it has had on their fans, pop culture, storytelling, and humanity. I thank them.[換行字元][換行字元]The first big chapter of the MCU has finally arrived.

I know I'll probably watch the movie three or four times, at least.[換行字元][換行字元]Since Captain America, Marvel has really tapped into the emotional side of these characters, they have managed to go deeper and deeper in not only making us care for the heroes, but also making us even care for and empathize with the villains as well.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie has the broadest emotional ranger of them all and it is truly an event movie.[換行字元][換行字元]I loved it, and I love the MCU.

4386,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has certainly revolutionised modern cinema; back in 2008, Iron Man opened to positive reviews but few foresaw the cultural phenomenon this world was to become and the generation of adoring fans it was to muster. Eleven years on and the highly anticipated climax of this particular saga of the MCU hits the screens; Avengers: Endgame. Its predecessor, Avengers: Infinity War may have ended on a rather low note for Earth's mightiest heroes, as intergalactic despot Thanos succeeded in wiping out half the universe, but they return in full force in this ambitious and decidedly bombastic conclusion. From the beginning, Marvel old hands The Russo Brothers paint a very new world, a greyer one wracked by Thanos' deadly 'Snap'. Among the surviving Avengers, there's a strong sense of survivor's guilt and very little sense of hope... yet it would be unlike the characters we know to not make one last attempt to save the universe. To divulge in any more detail the plot of Avengers: Endgame would be to severely undermine its impact; this is a cinematic thrill-ride, with surprises aplenty, nodding dollops of fan service and a hefty level of emotional stakes. One thought the sheer scale of Infinity War was seismic, but the Russos outdo themselves with Endgame, crafting a climactic and grandiose, but equally satisfying conclusion to a decade of work. It's a different beast to its predecessors in many ways, but Endgame still manages to pull off that nifty balance between humour and drama that makes Marvel work. The film can only be described as a victory lap for Marvel, a love letter to their characters and fans. After a brilliantly unexpected prologue, the film takes a little while to find its rhythm, but once it does... it really does. Credit is due particularly to Christopher Markus' and Stephen McFeely's script, a quick-witted and compassionate piece of work that propels the story breezily through its three-hour run time. Despite the Avengers' predicament, it isn't all doom and gloom; the benefits of a smaller ensemble cast allow Endgame to have that same sense of banter from Joss Whedon's Avengers Assemble, something that occasionally felt missed within the tidal action of the latter part of Infinity War. Within the first hour, the plot is taken on a definitive path, one that is neither untrodden (there is a memorable comic sequence where the characters wryly commentate on this) nor particularly smooth (plot inaccuracies can easily be raised). Despite this, however, it allows the film to take off on what can only be described as a golden reward for Marvel fans, an action-packed feast of a film that pays due homage to its universe. There's also a biting edge to Endgame though in its emotional resonance, frequently heart-breaking yet never gratuitous. There are so many aspects that are so caringly rendered in Endgame; Alan Silvestri's diverse score and the textured visual effects spring eagerly to mind. As always in a Marvel caper, the cast is a blisteringly good ensemble effort. In Endgame, every actor is on top form, bouncing off eachother with natural ease. Josh Brolin's scene-stealing Thanos from Infinity War is disappointingly less on show here, but this is almost made up for the excellent use of some of the previous film's more underused players (Chris Evans' Captain America and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow are given meatier roles here). A special mention should also go to Robert Downey Jr in a performance that radiates power and poignancy. Avengers: Endgame does sacrifice itself occasionally in the complex myriad of stories it tells; at points, there are a few too many of these vignettes and the film can feel a tad clunky (Infinity War gave the arc to its villain to combat this). However, the paths all lead pretty much perfectly together in a third act that is indisputably awesome and packs an emotive punch. Avengers: Endgame is a monumental piece of cinema, both in scale and significance; these stories have defined childhoods and, here, a fitting end is delivered to this part that not only feels satisfyingly conclusive but is excellently put together by the creative force behind it. Colossal and captivating, this is another sure success from the team at Marvel that looks difficult to beat."
4387,"This film is no Masterpiece. The Russo Brothers phoned in for a relevant follow-up to Infinity War. The first two hours were incredibly dull and boring. This film was filled to the brim with Fan Service and not enough Original Story. The final hour was amazing and worth the price of admission. The movie could've been condensed and it could've gotten to the point sooner. The humor feels forced and lazy. The film was filled with jump cuts and reused camera shots from previous films. The CGI is well done. The acting is poor at points. Overall, this is an average film, with two-thirds of it falling under below average."
4388,"I know why some people are giving it 5/6/7/8 and no movie is perfect and it has some shortcoming but nonetheless it delivers what the finale of a saga is supposed to be. It is incomparabale to any other superhero movie. It has drama, comedy, high emotions and ultimate mind bending action scenes with a lot of twists and surprises to make this movie near perfect for me. It doesn't deserve a rating below 10 and hats off to Russo brothers they are awesome."
4389,"Quantity over quality. The whole Avengers series is based on this principle and therefore, the finale rating that this series deserves is 1."
4390,"I understand that there are still many Marvel films in the works but this really did feel like a conclusion to the 20+ films that came before. Great action sequences with a lot of payoffs for anyone who has seen the previous film and will run you through the entire scope of emotions. There is one seen in particular that was incredible and gave me goosebumps. This is something we've never seen happen before and something we may never again. It really took so many pieces to fall in place and for that this film will stand the test of time and should be considered a milestone event, rather than just a great film. For those reason this is a 10/10 film."
4391,"As a fan of Marvel, I'd say that this movie is the best absolute best! If Stan Lee saw this, he would think that this film is a amazing tribute to him.[換行字元][換行字元]It was also a good send off to Tony Stark & Natasha Romanoff, Who will always be in our heart.[換行字元][換行字元]And there was also a good conclusion to Steve Roger's storyline where he is reunited with Peggy Carter.[換行字元][換行字元]As Stan Lee Would Say, Excelsior!"
4392,"This movie is EVERYTHING. There is action, and comedy, and romance. It's a story about family - both gained and blood - and it opens so many different possibilities to the future! I was laughing and crying at the same time. The cast is obviously amazing - but shout out to Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Karen Gillian."
4393,"Avengers, Assemble! How rare is it to shed tears of joy during a movie. Well, this movie makes you do that again, and then again, and then more. The MCU, and us, we grew together. And so, this movie had to be much more special as it was the end of that journey. But it was not just special, it was fulfilling and you feel a sense of peace, and strangely, instead of wanting to see more, you know this is how it was supposed to be. Everything will be okay after this."
4394,Wow what an end to the MCU. VERY SATISFIED. A must watch.
4395,"After Infinity war I thought we would get a epic conclusion. That is no where near the case. I have no clue what the people rating it 10 watched, there must be two versions. This one movie pretty much ended my love of marvel films. And will be my likely be my last. Terrible writing ruined and killed off beloved charters. I like how Captain America was handled. But wrong person got shield. The movie was 2 and a half hours of garbage. With 30 minutes of ok action. Had a couple good moments but that's about it. What a huge let down from everyone involved. Save your money wait for it on Redbox."
4396,"This was the most satisfying end to a movie franchise ever. You win some and lose some, the ending is sad and happy, we laugh and some may likely cry, we see some old faces and new ones step up into the light. The perfect balance. The writers really thought out each and every scene to the last detail and everything is executed to perfection. It was so satisfying I didn't feel the 3 hours this movie ran for."
4397,Despite the negative responses from people with low IQs this movie brought the epic final battle to life! Most of the dim witted comments come from people that have no idea that you have to get from point A to point B and build a story.
4398,"I hardly think anyone could fairly admit to disappointment after experiencing the sufficiently bombastic, tearful and wacky conclusion to a decade of Marvel content that delivers on every promise and gives (as others have stated before me) back to the fans in a very unique way.[換行字元][換行字元]The entire movie is a spoiler. That said...there isn't a whole lot more TO say. If Infinity War was your cup of tea, Endgame is going to do everything you want it to... but not in the way you expect it to. Yes, there's a measure of predictability; but there's also plenty of surprises - a mix of both, really, which feels just about right.[換行字元][換行字元]My feelings a few hours after seeing Endgame are as follows: Sad, a little depressed that some things will never be the same going forward. I know all good earthly things have an end - sometimes it's a little difficult to accept. In a way, the good ol' days are now officially ""old"". On the flip side of the coin, I'm a little exuberant about the possibilities opened up, the new concepts explored, and probably more than anything, the completely perfect fanfare that had the folks at my cinema cheering and applauding at every turn. In other words, I'm experiencing mixed emotions. Decipher my very cryptic notes as you will... but see Endgame for yourself. It's hardly something to be missed. And it's hardly something to be forgotten.[換行字元][換行字元]Some people move on. But not us.[換行字元][換行字元]Not us."
4399,No spoilers. This movie is fabulous. From beginning to end you are inthralled with intrigue. From time to time you may be crying to laughing within seconds. The special effects and character interactions are also very well done. I highly recommend this movie.
4400,Avengers Endgame is the best by far. All Marvels Cinematic Universe movies come together beautifully.
4401,"What this studio has continued to do over the last decade is absolutely incredible. I can still remember the absolute thrill of sitting down in the theater and witnessing the creation of the MCU in the first Iron Man. Now, 11 years later, as a 19 year old, I can easily say that I experienced the same feelings I did all those years ago. I do not typically write reviews, but this movie deserves to be written about. It has moments where you laugh your ass off and it has moments where your heart is in your stomach. While I could write/complain about all of the things that I was upset about, or all of the things that caught me off guard, in the end the Russo Brothers made an absolute masterpiece that is there cherry on top of one of the greatest franchises of all time. I couldn't be happier with this film, and I couldn't be more excited to see what Marvel Studios has in store for hardcore fans such as myself."
4402,"I will need to watch this again but out of the gate I feel Infinity War was a more accomplished film. This felt a little empty in the villain stakes which has been a major problem for Marvel films. The film is fun but I felt they created various plot holes and in essence created multiple realities In the process, something that is not resolved. I will review again down the line."
4403,This film is easily the best and ambitious Marvel film I've ever watched. It has some crazy moments and has found a balance that makes it so special. Absolute must watch!
4404,"As it's already been said by most reviewers, this film is superb , 3 hours went by in a blink of an eye . Was it really that long ? , didnt seem like it at all . Marvel have once again made the perfect superhero movie . I've said that before , but they just keep on getting better and better . God knows how they are going to top this one ? . It was funny , very funny in places , emotionally draining in others but way way cool .. I cannot wait to see it all over again ....10/10 perfect ."
4405,Majorly disappointed. It didn't have as much character development as I would've hoped for M' Baku.
4406,"It's been a long, fruitful eleven years for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and never has that been more apparent than in this, the true culmination of that protracted journey. Engame is a die-hard crowd pleaser, going above and beyond to check every box on the wish list, sometimes even to its own detriment. We get resolutions and payoffs to dozens of dangling threads, not to mention years' worth of fan service, while flashing back to the preceding films in a way that doesn't feel exploitative or redundant. Character moments abound, always a hallmark of the Avengers franchise, but where in the past it was enough to merely watch the big personalities bounce around a room, this time we see a tremendous logical change in each of them.[換行字元][換行字元]The plot suffers from pacing issues, leaves behind a whole slew of gaping holes and tends to over-rely on twists and misdirection where the expected route would've been much cleaner. It can feel disappointingly blunt at times, then surprisingly subtle and nuanced in others. At some points, more than a few, you'll feel that the Marvel slate has never been more forced, never cheesier. In others, you'll be shocked to realize you're still watching a superhero movie. It's not as smooth as the MCU's best, nor as efficient, nor as visually ambitious, but when it gets where it's going the results are spectacular. I credit that more to the decade of careful planning and coordinated execution than I do to this film in particular, though points are certainly due for sticking the landing.[換行字元][換行字元]When I found myself walking away from the cinema, contemplative and maybe a little bit shell-shocked, I experienced a strange mix of calm, relief and fulfillment. I wasn't amped up like a Rocky movie. I hadn't been through something titillating or epic, an instant classic that I'll assuredly watch over and over again. I just knew that it was over, I was cool with that, and I was satisfied by the closure. This iteration of the team went out on a high note, but not its highest. The perfect ending, if not nearly a perfect film."
4407,"Avengers Infinity wars and Endgame might very well have been one movie and therefore could have saved me a ticket to the movie theater for the second time round. It wasn't necessary for it to be divided into two parts, hell it wasn't necessary for Endgame to be almost 3 hours long considering the flimsy plot![換行字元][換行字元]After I saw infinity wars, I already had a suspicion I was cheated, and Endgame proved that I was right. This entire movie was trying to drag for so long and even the quasi emotional scenes just didnt do it for me. I felt nothing when Black Widow jumped to her death, which was one of the few parts of this movie that actually made sense, sacrificing someone dear to get the soulstone.[換行字元][換行字元]But what it came down to is the cliched classic jump back in time travel plot, however it wasn't supposed to be like Back in the Future, so they say. But Captain America came back in the same time-line as an old man, so how is that not like Back in the Future?!?[換行字元][換行字元]Also Captain Marvel was totally hyped, but didn't played much of a role in the entire movie, talk about overhyping it![換行字元][換行字元]You see I have been cheated.....and all of you aswell."
4408,"After 22 movies that slowly built up to this point, it was nicely executed, yes this one has some drama, some background on people's lives after the Thanos ordeal from the Infinity War, how people / characters changed etc etc. Has usual light heart witty jokes, the of course the Grand Finale, Watched on IMAX -3D and totally worth it. Got the tickets the first day they went on sale, Kids were counting days... Totally Worth it. Cant wait for it on Blu ray."
4409,The pinnacle of the marvel cinematic universe. Everything they have learned from past movies was implemented here.
4410,"This looks like a Good Movie for All Ages, because it's like a Best Movie for All Ages produced by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures and Marvel Studios"
4411,This movie is a mesmerizing ending of Infinity saga which started in 2008. Each and every reference of previous movies are so much enjoyable to watch. Every Frame of the movie holds viewers attention and interest perfectly.
4412,"Don't even try to except anything when you go to see the movie because even if you will try super hard, there is no way you can guess what will happen. The movie has an amazing story, twists, fight scenes, and some really emotional scenes too. It will give you everything you want to it to show you and even more. So trust me, Do not waist and go watch this beautiful movie when you have a chance to."
4413,"What can I say but WOW! This has to be one of the most boring movies that I have ever seen in my life. I loved Infinity War but Endgame on the other hand is utter trash. Way too many fanboys overlooking major plot holes. Personally I would give it around a 6. However, seeing how many people are giving this a 10, to try restore some semblance of balance, I will give it a 1."
4414,Will go see it again. Not as good as Infinity War but a good conclusion to the story.
4415,"A great end of an era. That's all I need to say. Not a crazy Marvel fan, but this one just got me right away."
4416,"Incredible movie, abseloutly phenomenal second part of Infinity War. It isnt a happy ending like other movies. Just a wow movie"
4417,"Can't be over, I want more! I'll miss all of them together, fighting as one"
4418,"I enjoyed every moment, but I have to say that infinity war was a little better.[換行字元][換行字元]I have objections here and there but the great action and comedy makes up for it..[換行字元][換行字元]Overall It's a fully satisfactory conclusion.. 3 hours well spent.."
4419,"A satisfactory finale to ""Avengers: Infinity war"", which surprised me, as I scored the earlier film a 4/10 on this site.[換行字元][換行字元]Why the improvement? Well, even though I hadn't kept up with the other films in this franchise (i.e. the Marvel Cinematic Universe) before seeing ""Avengers: Endgame"" (which was no different to how I saw ""Avengers: Infinity war"", this time I didn't feel as though I was missing important information or events from those MCU films which I hadn't seen. So, even though I hadn't seen the current ""Captain Marvel"" film and she appears in this film, there just didn't seem to be anything that I was missing by not having seen that other film. That wasn't the case so much with the Ant-Man character, but I wasn't really bothered by not getting the payoff which I presume was intended from him.[換行字元][換行字元]Since this is the finale to a sequence of MCU films, I won't bother outlining the story so far...you should at least have seen the previous Avengers films in order to be contemplating watching the finale. So, I'll just note some things which struck me, watching this film...it may, therefore, be more interesting to people who have already seen this film.[換行字元][換行字元]General observations:[換行字元][換行字元]* Whilst the film was generally satisfying, I doubt that it would stand up well to repeated viewings, as it isn't particularly briskly paced or action-packed (not that these are necessarily bad things, especially given how boring Hollywood films can be when they go down that route).[換行字元][換行字元]* I wasn't a fan of the treatment of Thor in this film. Even though I've never read a Thor comic, or watched further than the first film of his own franchise, I have to say that the humour revolving around him didn't work for me. He comes across as a plummy sounding Englishman who watches way too much LA based teen comedies or something. Some of the humour was conceptual, though...in the way that Monty Python can be conceptual...your head recognises the joke but you just don't laugh. I didn't mind his pun near the end of the film though, concerning another MCU franchise. I am curious whether Chris Hemsworth went ""method"" for this role though, or whether CGI was used instead.[換行字元][換行字元]* Another big problem with the film is that it just lacks storytelling smarts, as far as the action sequences go, although that flaw is pretty much endemic to every action film ever made. The second Lord Of The Rings film, I think, conquered that common failing, in that the war scenes displayed military strategy and tactics in a dramatic and engrossing way...but perhaps that had more to do with the nature of the military technology utilised in that story? To paraphrase this point, I'm saying that you don't really get scenes where you feel that your favourite Avenger is kicking goals, so to speak (and as I don't feel particularly invested in any of the characters, this didn't bug me so much). You don't even feel as though they are in mortal danger. All you get is countless thousands of CGI fighters engaged in battle, as is Hollywood's wont. There was a missed opportunity to create drama in those set pieces. For instance, much drama could have been made of Ant-Man's abilities and how they could avert a catastrophic loss of lives amongst the forces of good. You really don't get much on that front though...you see a little bit of tactics but no drama there, whatsoever.[換行字元][換行字元]* Connoisseurs of time travel stories might enjoy the proceedings of this film, as there is much meta-discussion about the merits of the logic of other time travel stories known to popular culture. For all I know, the theory of time travel espoused in this film might be as absurd or incomprehensible as that of any of the films that the characters in ""Avengers: Endgame"" critique. The discussion is interesting nonetheless and I may try to find the script for this film in order to become more familiar with the ideas presented in it.[換行字元][換行字元]* CGI plays a big part in this film, as I've already mentioned with regard to the battle scenes. It also plays a part on a more intimate level. For instance, I recognised John Slattery as the actor playing one of the characters in the film. He seemed too young though for it it to be him. I'm not sure whether CGI was used for him (maybe they just used conventional special effects?)...or whether John has discovered a new facial cream with wonderfully restorative properties for his skin. Speaking of John...his character has possibly the most bizarre handshaking technique ever represented on film. It also seems to me that Robert Redford got an even bigger CGI treatment for this film than Slattery did.[換行字元][換行字元]* I doubt that anything at all hinges on a comment that one character made in this film, but it sounds like it should...""We deal with it by not dealing with it"". I'd be interested to know if the relevant MCU franchise (""The Black Panther"") will revisit this comment.[換行字元][換行字元]* The comment about Doctor Strange ""giving away"" one of the Infinity Stones intrigued me. If that was in the previous Avengers film, I've forgotten about it. Maybe I should remind myself of the circumstances of that event? In any case, I'm not sure that this film sheds light on why he might have done that. Or did I miss something?[換行字元][換行字元]* Since this instalment of the ""Avengers"" franchise serves as a bookend, I wonder whether I can be tempted back to the MCU sometime, given that the MCU is very hit-and-miss, and mostly misses, it seems to me. If I can't, then not a bad way to end this fling with Marvel.[換行字元][換行字元]* Curious about any lore concerning who may wield Thor's hammer."
4420,"It had everything you could ask for in a movie and more. The only genre it doesn't really touch is romance. It has the drama, the comedy, the action, the clever and often heartwarming dialogue, the personal struggles, the betrayals, fulfilling character archs that make sense (Unlike Game of Thrones), and the perfect ending to an amazing movie journey."
4421,"Endgame is such an amazing experience that it never felt like its an 3hr movie. The final battle is epic and ending is emotional. Sad that Avengers world came to an end and I am never gonna watch our original Avengers with whom all this journey started. But as Mr.Stark said that ""Part of journey is the end"" and yeah here it is."
4422,This movie blew me away. I don't want to reveal any spoilers but omg. The film made me laugh and cry. Also nearly made me have an heart attack. The performances was so good. It was brilliant. I think I might go watch it another 2 times.
4423,The best movie i have seen ever ........but this movie make me cry
4424,"I don't want to write much in here because you can't really go into the story without spoiling it. All I can say is that it's the pay off the fans wanted.[換行字元][換行字元]I haven't been as emotional in a cinema for a very long time; I honestly don't know if I have been. This movie is a wild ride of laughs, gasps and tears. The three hour run time feels more like two, which speaks volumes for it.[換行字元][換行字元]There are a few questionable points that can be nit-picked and require somewhat convenient story points to explain, which originally had me giving this movie a 9. However, upon further thought, the impact this film had on myself and the fans who've waited 11 years and 22 outings for a conclusion, deserves the highest score available. Possibly even purely for the final showdown which as an absolute spectacle.[換行字元][換行字元]I don't need to tell you to go see this movie, but I'll do it anyway.[換行字元][換行字元]GO. SEE. THIS. MOVIE."
4425,"The best conclusion to anything I have ever watched in my life. There are no words to express what was coursing through my veins throughout the entire film. A must see. It bugs me when people that aren't fans are saying that it's too many movies to start. Now that the movie is number 5 of all time, it proves that it is more than worth it. A must see."
4426,"I just came back boi , nothing to say im speechless to the bone! All what i can say , ""expect the unexpected"" stay strong my dear MCU fans because #whateverittakes ! Idk what to do with my life anymore , thank you for reading this! i shall go cry in bed bye"
4427,"Avengers: Endgame, right off the bat, throws its audiences for a loop with some very unpredictable twists that make you question what will happen for the rest of the movie. The first half of the movie felt fairly disappointing considering what I was expecting and, at times, had a more comedic tone that felt off and unnatural. The disappointing aspects of the first half are entirely made up for and more with the second half. The second half is truly EPIC. The second half might be some of the greatest sci-fi and action ever to be made. The way it ends is completely heartbreaking, but yet sweet. The way the movie pays tribute to the previous movies in this universe is spectacular. One last thing to mention, the first part of the credits is so beautifully designed. It might seem like a weird thing to praise, but it is great."
4428,It ends off on a sad note however you begin to crave whatever comes next for the sequel
4429,I wasn't expecting too much going to the theater for Endgame but this was one of the best movies produced in the recent year.
4430,"The best film ever in this world, i hope marvel can make many great film im the future"
4431,"One of the best superhero movie,,, and Thor,,, Iron Man,,,, antman superveb but Thor jst love u superveb Thor funny,,, action,,, cry everything"
4432,"This is best superhero movie that I ever watch. The storyline was great and powerful with its emotion weight and great treatment to all the characters. If you think Infinity War is more to Thanos storyline,then don't be disappointed because this is the Avengers movie. The movie also bring us to the journey where you can remember the movie what it's supposed to be. 30 years from now, I guarantee that you will introduce and share the love of this movie to your child or grandchild."
4433,"Everyone who is giving less than 10 is stupid , dum and can't understand this movie"
4434,"Without any doubts I will rate this movie 10/10 and even if you're not a Marvel Fan, you will definitely gonna love this movie."
4435,Every character's superpowers are ruined.. too messy for a so called best of the best.. comedies arnt on point..
4436,The movie is One of the best movies that I ever watched it was to emotional and too exiting f... I cried 3 times at it the twist was very good and a very amazing directors and for real thank you Russo brothers and thank you Stan Lee for this masterpiece and may you rest in peace Stan
4437,"Disappointed. Took too long to get to the point.back and forward.that i understood but,many flaws , slow story and i nearly gave up. ...thank the lord for the end.it had elements of being great instead, it was just watchable .pretty bad for a marvel fan."

4439,"So where to start?[換行字元][換行字元]After 11 years of watching all MCU movies repeatedly (like countless times, you can ask my friends about it, talk about INFINITY watch 😅). I am more than happy that the Marvel Studios together with the Russo brothers and all of their crews brought this movie to life.

4441,"First off, 'Endgame' is definitely worth watching. It is hard to overestimate the cinematic achievements demonstrated in the movie. It pays tribute to all the plotlines that had been leading up to this culmination through the years. There are some exceptional and iconic scenes which will surely command admiration of many Marvel fans to come.[換行字元][換行字元]There are moments to rejoice, there are moments to cry, there are moments to laugh, there are moments to appreciate the fact that you are a contemporary of the people involved in bringing this whole universe to life and that you can experience all this first-hand.[換行字元][換行字元]Judging the film by its own merits, however, is a different story. It felt like the directors wanted to seize this 'last' chance and do homage to so many characters and so many things that in the end we are left with this motley crew of multiple episodes and actions stuffed in one wannabe epic finale.[換行字元][換行字元]With all its charge and glory, 'Avengers: Endgame' does not surpass 'Infinity War'. After that masterful fight on Titan, turning a black hole into butterflies bears no comparison to taming... a river."
4442,"After the poignant ending of EndGame, the baton has passed on the next phase of the MCU franchise. I just hope Marvel Studios can just match what they have given us here.[換行字元][換行字元]The character driven moments in EndGame is what set it apart from the other Avengers movies to-date. Just go and watch it not for the spectacle that we expect but for the many characters many of us have grown accustomed to."
4443,"The movie is 3 hours long. Not once did I look at my watch or feel the need to take a break. You are entertained from the gutsy opening scene to the very last frame.[換行字元][換行字元]It's funny, it's dramatic and it's larger than life. Everything you might want in an ""end game"" after over ten years of build up.[換行字元][換行字元]If the movie had a flaw (big IF) is that this is made for the fans that have watched ALL the movies. A billion characters and just as many references and call backs.

This one needs to be seen in the theater to enjoy the epicness on screen."
4444,That is the sign of a good movie. From start to finish your basically glued to it. And the humor in it is better than expected. The action and special effects are above avg. Good story line to follow the previous movie.
4445,"I enjoyed watching this amazing movie just like infinity war, almost 3 hours and not boring yes 3 hours of amazing acting-vfx-jokes-drama-action all in one . Marvel did a very good job but too bad thanos dies, for me he is the best character but anyway the villain should die at the end."
4446,Proud to be the generation who witnessed all this! The movie brought uncontrollable tears though!
4447,"What a beautiful wrap up to the a decade of story building... its remarkable what they have achieved.. generally wraps up are just forced and goodbyes .. but there was a solid story... great linkage to all major story archa ... direction, VFx!

Marvell makes it all look so easy but when u look at other franchise you realise what they have created is nothing short of perfection.[換行字元][換行字元]Warning[換行字元][換行字元]If you have younger kids who are invested in marvell just to let you know they will be a bit disturbed.. it took my 30 min to console my son.. he couldnt stop crying!!"
4448,"While I respect the fans going ga ga and people discussing the emotions etc, I beg to differ. I saw this movie yesterday after all the rush had died out. There were about 25-30 people in the Audi having seating capacity of approx 250.[換行字元][換行字元]Pace: The buildup is slow and boring.[換行字元][換行字元]Emotions: Forced and sometimes looks very artificial. You don't feel a thing. When some people said that they cried, I wonder for what. Action: It comes late and is limited. I expected more (isnt that expected in the avengers movies?)[換行字元][換行字元]CGI: Was good.[換行字元][換行字元]Storyline: Very weak. It could have been refined. Many of the characters were inserted and wasted.[換行字元][換行字元]Length: It was unnecessarily prolonged, esp towards the end. They could have reduced the runtime by 20-30 minutes.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall: Bad. Barely a one time watch, with lots of patience. The studios have created the hype and made their money. The previous avenger movie was way better. This one was a totally let down, just like the Game of Thrones final season."
4449,It is a 3 hour movie that i can watch and have watched multiple times and still enjoy it the same everytime due to me watching all the movies beforehand and getting referances
4450,A masterpiece of incredible Heights. Some of the scenes were sensational with emotional tones that carried so much weight
4451, avengers assemble  when those words are said was an awesome part of film but there were plenty of them and teared up times too fantastic film
4452,"No other words needed, except thank you to everybody involved in creating the MCU and an even bigger thank you for endgame! Absolutely incredible!!! Applauds in the cinema!"
4453,This ties everything into a perfect little bow but this us not the end of MCU
4454,"The only flaw of this movie is the fact that Marvel will not be able to top this up.

Let's not forget that Strange seen 14m different ones and this was the only possibility.[換行字元][換行字元]Hats off for the Russo Brothers."
4455,"The jaw dropping conclusion to the greatest movie franchise in history cannot be understated. If you're a fan of sitting with your mouth open for three hours as the greatest conclusion in movie history unfolds, this is all yours. Enjoy"
4456,It was like Christmas coming early. The movie great and I highly recommend it. I'm not gonna write a dissertation just know the movie was good.
4457,None of the rules presented in movie makes sense. Bad movie in regards to final conclusion
4458,What a finish to the Avengers saga. One of the masterpiece in superhero movies.
4459,"Woah, just got out of the theater, and this movie is amazing, man! I'm not one to go crazy about a film but this is one to get crazy for! It has everything someone wants out of an MCU film, great story, great characters, great action, great emptional moments, and an amazing villain. It felt like an event, and let's hope it becomes the highest grossing film of all time!"
4460,This is a must see film!! It's EASILY the best avenger movie of all time. It's 3 hours long but i didn't look at my watch once. Movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.
4461,"Overall, I think it was a great way to wrap everything up. I personally think it took a while for everything to get up to speed, but once it did is was very entertaining. That is the main reason why I think infinity war was better honestly, infinity war never really slowed down. Saying that Thor made the movie worth watching for me. The hulk is not the hulk anymore, he's basically beast from X men. The hulk is supposed to be unpredictable and destructive. They turned him into a genius gorilla. Wish the guardians played a bigger part personally but I understand why they didn't. Great final battle scene and the ending that ultimately needed to happen. Definitely worth the watch"
4462,"First of all it's a very loooooooong movie. 3 hrs. I was waiting for this one for months now, so excited at what was going to come. But Alas.. What a mess. The first hour is a complete boring time of them showing what the world has come to. I mean quite boring with slight humor. Second hour, the movie starts picking up, with more content (confusing time travel) and some good humor. The last hour (like when you are actually asking where's the action, where are the effects, 3D etc), it's starts to show some hope. And some action starts. Gets you going.. For a bit.. And then it ends. The action is hardly there.. Whatever is there is forgettable. Nothing worth like the earlier ones. Overall the movie is not a little below average, with nothing memorable in it. I can't believe the business is done. I came home and had to watch Infinity War to get over this one. And believe me folks... Infinity War was way better than this. Way way better with its story and action. Don't waste your money on this melodrama.. Watch it on TV when it comes..."
4463,"It s a joke after another joke. No pathos. No Drama. I m a diehard fan from comics, and they kill all my dreams and expectations. It was impossibile to fail the movie after the masterpiece of IW...but Disney is Disney: they must follow specific political choiches without really caring about it (race and sexual politics), and it s all a mess. What a miss opportunity..."

I have never left the theaters so satisfied from a movie which was hyped and had super expectations. The directors have delivered a masterpiece.

They made it sound like it was the best one ever made...but I was completely disappointed.[換行字元][換行字元]It's was long and stretched out, they had to put things in there that didn't have any business being in there, and in the end I just felt like it was a big ball of confusion.[換行字元][換行字元]I was very disappointed in this one and so was my husband. Infinity Wars was great LOVED it but this one wasn't great."
4472,"A great ending, to a much loved saga. It would have been very easy for Marvel to mess this one up, but it delivered in all aspects."
4473,"Superior and satisfying closing chapter (almost) of MCU Phase 3. There are several significant parent-child moments (some where only one party recognises the other), some touching reconciliations for the greater good, some beautiful sacrifices for friends and many more surprisingly poignant elements that had me a little damp around the eyes. Chris Hemsworth is hilarious again as Thor, Robert Downey Jr shows yet again why he deserves his top billing status, and Chris Evans puts in a solid performance as America's finest. It's brilliant how the Russo brothers direct the ensemble piece with such a huge cast to bring together. It is really hard to make the audience care so deeply about so many, but if you've stuck with the MCU since Iron Man 1 you will feel every defeat and every victory of each character. Thanos remains a really interesting and 'principled' villain, and it takes every bit of strength and ingenuity to combat him. The fight scenes are nothing special, really - more of the same, but thankfully there aren't too many of these and the real quality of the film comes through the story-telling, characterisation, humour and interpersonal 'moments'. Excellent."
4474,Absolutely speecheless. Magnificant. Go watch now!
4475,"This heartbreaking yet beautiful and satisfying work of art is a truly great end to the Marvel universe's 3rd phase and I would still be satisfied if it were the end of the Marvel universe altogether. It is a visually stunning, masterfully written and delicately polished story of a battle against a god. I think the performances were the best of the MCU and multiple scenes almpst had me crying. The comedy doesn't feel out of place and the pacing is near perfect, especially for a 3 hour film. This film will be remembered for generations to come, so if you havent seen it - be one the first generations to do so."
4476,"Amazing Movie with Epic actions, emotiins, and Everything. I Love It.[換行字元][換行字元]Love You Iron Man"
4477,What a spectacular end of Avengers series by Marvel.. Perfect ending..Better than expected..Feeling sad because its a end of era.. Marvel U entertained us from past 11 year and now no more avengers .. Just feel the movie 😊😊
4478,"This movie is so much childish. Whats wrong with you guys , i mean first thanos snap his fingers and then you guys did the same 😂 Is this some kind joke ?"
4479,"This movie has everything we all love so much about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Without giving away too much, everything was wrapped up nicely. There were several hair raising moments and a few nice throwbacks to the series. I couldn't have asked for a better ending. This movie did justice to all the movies leading up to this and now I'm sad that it's over. My heart is heavy. I will rewatch and relive these movies as many times as I can."
4480,"I did not expect to see in my life such a faithful rendition of my childhood heroes from the comics to the big screen ... the emotions was huge ... the only reason I kept and did not cry in the cinema was because I was shy not to see me ... . From Athens Greece Thank you STAN LEE for filling my childhood with those fantastic stories and heroes ,also Russo and marvel because you have respected our comic heroes on the big screen ... my only sadness is that we could not see avengers together with XMEN- fantastic four -Daredevil in the same movie, but you can not have it all at life"
4481,"This film is the best the MCU has to offer, I loved every second every joke hit the theatre with an uproar laughter. Every emotional scene will make you cry. Although to understand it you have watch all MCU films. Also I broke down and cried in my maths lesson. Great film."
4482,"This was a once in a lifetime experience a movie that will go to the books this movie gave it all , with action , story line. Made the viewer on the edge of his seat."
4483,"The fact that this movie still has a 9.2 rating really says a lot about the fans. They must either be 10, or have extremely low movie standards.[換行字元][換行字元]Also, the unnecessary and overwhelming immature jokes gave me cancer."
4484,It's truly the end of the Infinity Stones Saga and it felt like as tears where pouring out of my eyes at the last scenes. Everything was tied up and perfect. It was brilliant. The movie itself was a roller coaster of emotions. Everyone was cheering and then crying on the next scene. It was crazy. But it was full of love and humane. It was everything it needed to be.
4485,"Slow start but then: rollercoaster!!!! My son of nine years old - ""there is black panther"" - loved the movie as well."
4486,I'm glad I didn't pay to see this one... Infinity war was way better...
4487,"Wow, I really don't even know what to say. It's only been a day since I have seen the movie and it is still running through my head. I can say off first viewing that this is my favorite marvel movie hands down, if you have seen all 21 films over the past 10 years, this movie has so many callbacks ranging from small conversation that was in one movie to bigger details in others. This film manages to use its key players to their max potential and makes everyone in this film feel important and you feel emotionally connected to every single one of them.[換行字元][換行字元]I don't know what else there is to say but GO WATCH THIS MOVIE."
4488,I thought the movie was good. As good as many of the others. They're always at least fun and a few were great. This one is good but that's it. I think Avenger hysteria and hype is what's driving the super high ticket sales. Yes they had a billion dollar weekend but I wonder if it will slow down now. I knew people who saw Titanic 2-3 times and a few up to 8 times when it came out. This is not one of those movies.
4489,It was one of the most emotional movie that I have ever seen. It was EPIC.
4490,"A Malaysian reviewer here. Screening on the 24th April 2019 and All i can say it is a behemoth undertaking compiling 21 or so films, expanding over 11 years of MCU phase 1 and phase 2 universe. How the heck are they going to pull this off? Questions arise and questions being answered with a 3 hour long movie. Its a good solid 3 hour marvel movie.[換行字元][換行字元]A good slow pace on the first part showing human vulnerability on superheroes. Even superheroes need emotional support from someone. Its is nice to see Hawkeye got some good character scene compared to his last/ previous involvement.[換行字元][換行字元]Second part comes the built up whereby it is fun to see how they interact with previous marvel films. (note to those don't follow MCU universe) You really need to see few previous marvel films to understand further what i am talking about.[換行字元][換行字元]The Third act is the final act whereby the brothers did a terrific job giving what fans wanted.

4491,"There is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie. I'm totally speechless. I haven't laughed (even cried) this much in Marvel movie or even in any movie. I'm fully on my emotion, there are so many tears of joy and loss. Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.[換行字元][換行字元]Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement...

People are clapping, laughing, crying, full of a state emotion. It's 3 hours long but it went by like a finger snapping by Thanos, and now I'm thinking I'm actually in Quantum Realm because it felt like 5 seconds. Even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.[換行字元][換行字元]**SPOILER ALERT**[換行字元][換行字元]Even some characters that you didn't like before, you will love them in this movie. Like Captain Marvel. I didn't like her before in her own movie but in Endgame they showed how powerful, how strong and how capable she really is. And now I kinda love her! But Marvel should really be careful of her line though, I didn't like some of her line like ""I'm the strongest"" and ""You didn't win because before you didn't have me"" duh. Also not gonna forget Hawkeye. To be honest, in Avengers I really didn't like Hawkeye because he's just a 'guy' with an arrow and just randomly showed up in any scene but actually he's character is so BADASS! Everything that we need, what we want is here.[換行字元][換行字元]Also I don't get it why some people can not accept that Thor is fat or treat him like a joke. I mean, this movie might be trying to give us a message about no matter what 'shape' are you, you can be a hero and save the world. To be honest, I like what they did to Thor, that man is depressed and taking the most responsible after he missed the shot to kill Thanos in Infinity War. Even though he already did killed him but it's not gonna bring back his people of Asgard. Also he's God of Thunder for god sake, he could slap his stomach with thunder and got his abs back.[換行字元][換行字元]I'm so happy too for Captain America. Finally he could do his dance with Peggy and I didn't expected that we could see the fight between Captain America with his own self.

The ending of this movie is we and the characters deserved. It gives a perfect balance for all these past 10 years. Epic and perfect ending, I was not disappointed at all.

4497,It was amazing and all but I personally enjoyed black widow and I didn't want her to die
4498,"This movie is a non-stop ride from start to finish. What a way to end this phase of movies and set up the new phase. I was completely blown away by the story and also by the casting. If you have not seen it yet, make sure you do ASAP! You will not be disappointed."
4499,Absolutely superb film! So brilliantly filmed. An amazing ending to the Avengers storyline. Rollercoaster of emotions but defiantly a must see!
4500,"It's a fine action movie for one time, jokes are good too. However, it lacks something that Infinity War had. As anyone else I've been waiting for the greatest hit the entire year. It's sad to admit but I left the theater with a feeling of disatisfaction."
4501,"This has to be the greatest movie of all time, never ever have I seen a film as phenomenal as this, in every department."
4502,"Think they've done the super hero thing to death and this one is no better or worse than any of the others, except it's a good 30 minutes too long. The CGI runs rampant as always, plot is ludicrous as they usually are with these things and if this truly is the final instalment it's come non too soon! A lot of young people love these kind of films of course and good luck to them, me, I'd prefer a good western!"
4503,"THIS IS THE MOST EPIC MOVIE ! Many surprises. Many. Everybody has done something legendary. I have to say Thanos is so much more powerful in this. I thought this wont be that good because captain marvel is main, but shes not. The main are the first six (Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye). This movie has totally changed my thoughts about Captain America. Yep this is THE BEST movie."
4504,"Worst Marvel movie made. For those of you who gave it anything higher than a 3 are either knuckleheads or don't know anything about the Avengers. CGI was cool, only reason I gave a 3. All the hype of Cpt. Marvel and she is in the movie for 5 minutes. Worse than Infinity War, which also sucked. Movie made no sense."
4505,"As an MCU fan, I really need to say that ENDGAME is the one among the best ever superhero movies and the most perfect conclusion that Infinity Saga can possibly have. The film completely fulfills each of the main 6 characters arc by the enactment of each of their respective destinies. I cried many times out of sorrow but alas ! they made me cry out of joy for the last 8 minutes. RDJr was damn right no one could have guessed the ending. THANK YOU MARVEL STUDIOS FOR GIVING ME SUCH AN AMAZING CHILDHOOD. WAS 11 YEARS OLD WHEN IRON MAN CAME UP AND NOW I'M 22. PROUD TO BE BORN IN THIS ERA OF CINEMATIC ADVENTURE. 😔🤗"
4506,An amazing epic movie of whole MCU. un expected ending. amazing stunts. togetherly wonderful.
4507,I saw avengers endgame on opening day and I have to say it's an amazing movie first the characters every character in the mcu is all here the characters are all likable they are not annoying nor repetitive all of the characters have the same personality from infinity war second the movie have lots of cool action that keep you entertained you for more and the characters all have us entertained all of the cast did a wonderful job portraying their characters another thing that is great about this movie is how it's funny not you always laughing but it does have some jokes for the audience to enjoy the soundtrack is an another great thing about this movie bringing the original avengers theme to this movie and portals were both great songs to this movie the acting was on point the plot was perfect The cgi and the special effects were both amazing to watch thank you marvel studios and the avengers cast for making this masterpiece.
4508,"If you've been loving the MCU films recently, then this will probably be your favorite one yet. It's absolutely jammed packed with material, and the more MCU films you've seen, the better it'll be.[換行字元][換行字元]However, the movie is dragged down by an extensive runtime, and jokes that miss the mark. Endgame takes too long to get going, and then seemingly never ends. And most of the humor is hit or miss; it just feels out of place.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, Endgame wraps up the Avengers ark reasonably well, but it's too arrogant and lacks any real sense of quality."
4509,"This was one heck of a movie . Not just a good marvel movie or a comic book movie it was genuinely great movie to watch . I laughed, i cried, i had goosebumps, i had all the fun that was expected and much more. The fight scenes were jaw dropping, comedy was hilarious and some moments were intense. Exception end to the past 10 year's."
4510,"Flicking through the ratings I saw a lot of 1/10 and a lot of 10/10. For me, it was like any other avengers movie, it was kinda epic. But still, 10/10 is a bit overrated.[換行字元][換行字元]A lot of trends they inject into movies these days aggravate me. You can look at any superhero movie, Marvel or DC, since fortnite was booming it was somehow featured in the movies. The same can be said for political movements or protests/marches (LGBTQ-acceptance, feminism etc.). I don't mind them, but I don't need to be reminded of them by seeing them in every movie I go to watch.[換行字元][換行字元]I think that this is the movie for a passionate marvel-fan, but it isn't the end of the world if you don't see it."
4511,All characters are amazing. I like captain marvel. Thor character is not as expected. Thor has different character in this part. All in all movies to too good and it deserve 9 stars.
4512,"From the devastating opening scene to the goosebump-inducing climactic action sequence, the scope and spectacle here will blow you away. Rich with humour (Thor and Ant-Man are highlights but even stoic Cap hass his moments), emotion, and inside references, it brings the MCU to a remarkable climax and resolve. After the blockbuster-high wears off some issues emerge (the main plot concept is severely underexplained; some characters are-understandably-neglected), but it remains a monumental film. 8.5/10"
4513,"This film was the perfect end to the past 11 years of the MCU, I cannot even begin to imagine what is going to happen next."
4514,I'm blown away by this movie. A fitting end for a saga spanning over a decade. I'm not sure I can enjoy any future marvel movies as much as I did this one.
4515,I just finished avengers End Game... I really don't want the same ending for Game of thrones... Sad but it's okay.... Really it's an End Game... Captain America stole my heart... Nataline break it.....A Movie worthy of watching if u knows all marvel heroes..........My rating is 8 out of 10..#Avenger
4516,I confess I am not an Avengers fan having missed much of the franchise since Iron Man. However as preparation for my trip to the cinema to see Endgame I thought I would catch up on the story by watching Infinity War and Ragnarok. I actually enjoyed both of these a lot more than Endgame. It promised to be quite a spectacle and the scale of the action sequences didn't disappoint. Some of the personal stories of the characters were also introduced quite well into the film. However unlike the simpler story lines of the previous two films as mentioned I think they tried just too hard with Endgame. Too many pieces of the plot thrown into the story just made it overwhelming and took the shine off what would otherwise have been a good conclusion.
4517,"Marvel used 22 movies to build the story of infinite war saga. Each champ has different stories shaping their personalities and leading the consequence of Endgame. In short, this movie is for us cheering marvel for years, and it indeed sets up a new level for future!"
4518,"Wowwwwww an amazing and to an amazingly era, can't get over it.... will never get over it, amaaaaaz8ng movie."
4519,"It's start when Tony Stark walk in to some bar and met General Ros to ask assemble team. I'll used to remember my childhood start watch this movie. And again and again every movie make me ages. Iron Man 1, 2 & 3. I'll never leave the movie theater, I'm like having short of fantasy to have another universe exists, and that universe full fill with a lot this superhero. My stress relieve when one of this Marvel universe movie comes. Thor, Caps, Ant Man, Avengers, etc. And I also watch series, agent of shield, agent carter. Its bring joy and happiness.[換行字元][換行字元]But it's remind me that everything will be moving on and people will grow up, suddenly we must forget everything and that will be our past.

4520,I can't believe how many people give this movie a 1/10 without any real explanation. Don't give it a bad rating just because you think the overall rating is too high. Stop it. Make a honest review. It's surely not a 1/10.[換行字元][換行字元]I loved the movie.

4522,Fitting end. Twists and turns. Best film in have seen for some tome
4523,"...but was left hanging in the end, with no smashing of Thanos. While there were so many fantastic parts to the movie and the wrap up of all the movies and characters combined to say farewell to the Era of Thanos, I was still waiting on Hulk's big moment and was sadly just left hanging. Now this may be because he's my sons favorite character and I knew the disappointment he felt and it radiated like gamma rays straight over to my seat ;) however I was expecting so much more. On that note, there were those definite moments where I got goosebumps and caught myself cheering aloud and slapping my leg with a ""oh, yeah!"" moment! And then there were the happy and then sad tears throughout as well which were shed. All in all, I wish there was another way for 1 character to remain and for another to appear more on screen, however I'm looking forward to seeing it again!"
4524,"I don't know why, but I always fall a sleep watching superhero movies. Managed to watch this one 40 minutes before snoring. There is something that switches my brain off, don't know what. Good for insomnia though. Can't really rate this one or the other, unless 20-40 minutes is enough for that. Giving this one 5."
4525,"The series is ended in a beautiful way. They are moments of happiness, fear, sadness, and satisfaction. Perfect movie to end the beloved time line of heroes."
4526,About the highest praise I can give this movie is that it surprised me after twenty one films to set it up. Three hours and you won't want it to end.
4527,"This isn't so much a movie as an experience. And the homework needed to fully appreciate this is daunting for the most dedicated fans. But the pay-off for sticking with the MCU for 11 years and 22 movies is nothing short of spectacular. So many shocking developments, awesome moments and tear jerking scenes that even the most critical, cynical moviegoers will just be beaten into thoroughly enjoying this movie. There will never be another cinematic moment like this."
4528,"This movie is a hectic and at sometimes confusing wrap up to 11 years of the Avengers. It's hard to see some of the characters that you love and have enjoyed for a decade leave the MCU. And perhaps watch the MCU end, with the PC comments coming out of marvel studios. It is heavily foreshadowed in the movie and honestly I have no interest in what's coming. However, me and my family thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Although it is not as good as Infinity War. Infinity war set the bar with story, pacing, action, and a cliffhanger that made you want to see endgame so bad that some people even went out to see that very average Captain Marvel movie. The best part about it was that they didn't let Captain Marvel ruin the movie. They let some things into this movie that 10 years ago they would never have. However, since it's the end I won't gripe about that. Good movie, it doesn't need any recommendations because everybody's going to see it. I enjoyed it."
4529,"Avengers Endgame is simultaneously the final chapter and a new beginning for the MCU. It brings to a close many of the stories and character arcs that have been built-up since the beginning with Iron Man. As a grand ending, is the film worthy? Yes it is. It's a great closing chapter as well as the start of something new. As a whole the film is good, though not without problems. I think this film is inferior to Infinity War, as well as the other MCU films the Russo Brothers have directed.[換行字元][換行字元]I thought the first forty minutes and the last hour of the film were fantastic. The acting is superb from everyone. The action scenes are great. The final fight of the film is the most phenomenal and rewarding action scene of the MCU or any superhero film. There's one scene involving Captain America that truly made me smile. With Cap being my favorite MCU character, this was my favorite scene of the film. The music is good. The effects are gorgeous. The epilogue is great. I loved what this film did for both Iron Man and Captain America. This was their film above all, and I was ultimately satisfied where their characters ended up at the end.[換行字元][換行字元]However, the middle portion of the film is definitely the weakest link of the movie in my opinion. The film is long; the longest comic book movie ever maybe. The first and third acts felt very fast, but in the middle portion I started to feel the length. It does get a bit boring. That's not to say the second act doesn't have any exciting or touching moments. It does, but it fails to live up to the first and third acts.[換行字元][換行字元]That's mostly due to my expectations and personal preferences. The film does go in a direction you would not have expected from the trailers in the second act. Honestly, this was the last place I would've wanted the movie to go. Not that the film does it badly, but this is a plot point that's been done so much to death in fiction, from movies, TV shows, cartoons, anime, manga, and especially comics. Most of the time it's used as crutch for writers to get themselves out of a corner they put themselves in, and I'm just sick of it. It's also something that's so easy to screw-up and makes your entire story convoluted. In this film they try so hard to make everything make sense, and it mostly does, but there are still a couple things that you call into question.[換行字元][換行字元]I honestly think it would have been better if they just adapted the original Infinity Gauntlet comic more faithfully. They should've introduced Adam Warlock and the universal concepts. That would've been insane. They even teased Adam Warlock in one of the past MCU films. I guess they're saving them for future movies.[換行字元][換行字元]There are also a few blatant logical issues. Infinity War had this too, mainly revolving around Thor, but this film even more so. One plot point near the end completely negates the importance of the Infinity Gauntlet itself from Infinity War. It does lead to arguably one of the best moments of the movie, but it's still a pretty big leap in logic.[換行字元][換行字元]The last major issue I have is what the film does with two major characters; Thor and Hulk. These two characters go through dramatic changes in this film. Now, these changes do make sense from a story sense. It wouldn't bother me as much if they did more in the film. Thor doesn't do that much until the third act, which is disappointing given how awesome he was in Ragnarok and Infinity War. Hulk doesn't contribute anything fight wise, which is even more of a disappointment. Hulk was barely in Infinity War, so I was expecting a big comeback in this, but that's not what happened.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, Endgame is a good film, and a good ending/beginning chapter of the MCU as a whole. It's not my favorite MCU movie, or even in my top 5. It's definitely the weakest of the Russo Marvel films. The film is a bit long, and I would've gone a different direction with it. There's some questionable logic in the film, and I'm not a huge fan of where they took Thor and Hulk's characters. However, despite all that, I was mostly satisfied by the end. If you're a big fan of Cap and Iron Man like I am (especially Cap) their resolutions are emotionally satisfying. I almost don't want to see anymore MCU films after this because this wrapped everything up pretty well. Everything from the first Iron Man to now has felt like a giant continuous story arc, and now it has finally come to a close. It's the end of an era for sure."

4532,"I found this movie confusing and fragmented ...all over the place. It appears that Thanos, even without the infinity stones can kick ALL the Avengers butts. What???"
4533,"When you see a ""10"" for this movie, you know there's a lot of blind love there. On the other hand, a ""1"" is blind hate.[換行字元][換行字元]A ""10"" would mean the movie is perfect, which is not - those guys should see a movie without emotion.[換行字元][換行字元]A ""1"" means the movie lacks even the very basic production, which it does not - those guys should check on IMDb the lowest rated movies ever - and watch them - to know what a really bad movie really means.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie fits the bill for the ones expecting the expectable - my case, by the way. I have seen really bad movies, and this is not the case. I've also seen very good movies, and this got close, but not that much."
4534,They could have cut an hour and a half of the slow unimportant scenes.
4535,"Well its all combined nice endgame movie. Lot of surprises, emotions, laugh and fight.. its an whole package."
4536,"I seriously don't know where to start with it, the film is totally packed with action,humor and emotional. Thank you the Russo brothers and Kevin Feige for giving us such an awesome movie the overall conclusion of 21 movie. I recommend to watch all the marvel studios movie before watching that because there are certain scenes related to that and if you haven't watch u won't be able to understand. The way they portray the story is brilliant and there are many few surprises which i bet you won't see that coming. Finally the infinity saga which leaded to everthing from the 1st iron man movie to the Infinity war has come to an end bringing us a new hope with the remaining new superheroes like Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Spider-Man and many more to form a new avenger initiative and i wish luck to marvel studios to continue building up more good movies like this and giving more opportunity to the new stars. Thank you Stan Lee, Marvel has always been my life since my childhood ,you are not in this world but you are always in my Heart Marvel is my heart. EXCELSIOR!!"
4537,One of the best movie and now the marvel completed it 21 movie as well as phase 3[換行字元][換行字元]The suspense is really so good[換行字元][換行字元]i especially like the new look of Thor and Hulk they made them a different and really funny 😂😂[換行字元][換行字元]The one thing is very sad; the Iron Man (Tony Stark) sacrifice himself to save the universe and to win against Thanos[換行字元][換行字元]I will not watch the Avengers if Tony Stark not present in it.
4538,"This movie is perfect, it perfectly wraps up the avengers storyline..... it didnt feel like a 10/10 at first but thats because i was used to the typical avengers/marvel movie chain of events. but after looking back on it it was PERFECTLY laid out, the majority of the movie lacks action and fight scenes but thats what it's supposed to be like, its the last time we're going to see some of these characters on screen and they deserve a proper send-off...... but once you get to the end of the film......... that fight sequence... OH... MY... GOD"
4539,I wish i was IRON MAN. Wearing that glove and when i snap my fingers.. jokowi the king of frog and his entire fellowship will just pop up from my country. By the way.. iron man is the winner !
4540,"From beginning to end the movie feels fresh. It feels like an end to era that started back in 2008 & I honestly wanted more in the end, I was willing to sit through for another hour or two. There will be people that love it or hate, it doesnt matter, they came to see the ending of the Infinity Saga cause these movie touched everyone that watched any movie from the saga. I will be seeing this again with a wider perspective of these characters & am thankful Marvel cares about their fans."
4541,"This is the most incridible movie I have ever seen! It had the perfect ending with an amazing unpredictable plot and alot of wonderful surprises.. Everything just makes sense in this movie, It couldn't have gone any better...simply GENIUS,AMAZING&INCREDIBLY AWESOME!"
4542,Fun movie to watch and interesting twist of characters they did with Thor and Hulk. But not worthy of 9/10 ... It's just a fictional superhero movie.
4543,"Well, i try not to spoiler it. Things to do when watch endgame: 1. Bring tissue, a lot of sad scene; 2. Laugh out loud, a lot of stupid and funny scene; 3. Don't guess it, 'cus a lot of suprise.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie great for ending the avengers. The battle to fast but i love it![換行字元][換行字元]Well i hope i can see more avengers movie, but sadly it is end.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you Capt. America and Iron Man."
4544,I won't spoil the movie but here's what it is in short.[換行字元][換行字元]It's not extremely action packed but it does have an amazing fight. It's logic is inconsistent at times and it's kind of irritating. Don't inflate your expectations for this film because you won't walk away satisfied.
4545,"Speechless. the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to undo Thanos' actions and restore order to the universe."
4546,"I was really hyped. But after I left the cinema I was kind of unsatisfied their were to many questions that were open.[換行字元][換行字元]The affects and the Actors/Actress were really beautiful, the film also got something to laugh but as I said I'm not really satisfied with the end.[換行字元][換行字元]They don't got any extra scene after the final credits."
4547,I wish I could rate this movie in 3.000 stars. It really deserves it.
4548,What a great entertainer. One of the finest movies of recent times. Everyone thought storyline will be predictable. But it actually isn't. We witnessed so twist and turn in the movie. It was emotional and chances are that you will leave the theatre crying and heartbroken. Overall I think it's a great farewell to avengers. Thank you MCU for another masterpiece. I give 10/10 to this last Avenger movie. Go and watch this epic movie.
4549,"I'm out of words, this movie is seriously the best MCU movie I have ever seen, omg. I was totally blown away of the. Fantastic movie"
4550,"3 hours of perfect entertainment alongside jokes, emotional scenes. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies. Deserving 10 points !! Go"
4551,"I know I'm late to the game here, but I can't remember the last time a movie lived up to THIS much hype...if anything, they undersold it a little. Three hours went by like 90 minutes....by the end I was just slackjawed. I now wish I'd seen it opening night. Anyone nitpicking this movie....I am so sorry for your sad little life."
4552,"Thank you-Marvel for giving me this epic movie,and beautiful memories,but I'm still crying and I'm done with you. Thank you all those years,and I'll always remember how you break my heart. And you are destroy everything you built in the past ten years. You destroy a little girl's dream that she got her first comic book at 12 years old. Yeah it's a good movie but the worst story."
4553,"The theater I was in broke out in cheers & applause at least ten times. And 3/4 of the audience refused to leave the theater after the movie was over because they wanted to dry their eyes, finish their conversations about the ending, and compose themselves so we could exit the theater without revealing spoilers. This was a movie made for fans and it brought all the feels."
4554,"Absolutely mesmerized, stunned, excitement, everything, every detail is perfect, this is the movie yet deserved to be rated on top."
4555,"Boring. Slow. Badly written, poor story.... worst of a bad bunch"
4556,"Seriously this is one hit kill for the closing of the series. You got it all in one, the action, the feeling. This movie melt my heart..."
4557,"I love marvel movies. They aren't always the greatest movies, they are usually really good, but they are always fun. To tie all the stories together, develop these characters, create emotional connection, and still be fun and entertaining is no small task. Lost couldn't even end a couple of seasons on an island. This crosses time, reality, and space and yet still is a wonderfully satisfying conclusion to 22 films. Wonderful. Simply wonderful. Though why am I writing this? Is there really someone deciding whether or not to watch the epic conclusion to these movies based on an IMDb review?"
4558,"What a brilliant way to follow Infinity War. Actually, Let me look at it more vaguely. What a brilliant film. This superhero blockbuster is not the usual to say the least. Most emotions we feel day to day are heightened at certain points in the film, causing you to laugh out loud, whimper, clap, or cry. This is DC's ""the Dark Knight"". This is television's ""Game of Thrones."" This is the Endgame."
4559,My 9 year old after 30 mins of watching asked me if we were in the right theater. It went worse from there.
4560,You obviously didn't understand the film if you hate it.
4561,No words to explain. The whole movie is good it contains all types of emotions
4562," A perfect end  what can say more ? and ok course you need say every single movie starting from iron man until captain marvel, to get full experience."
4563,Really overrated. Was funny at points however. I don't think I would even bother to watching it again. I do genuinely love the other marvel films but this one was soul draining and just a disappointing on the whole.
4564,"This movie is exactly what MCU fans have been dying to see. A send off to a generation of Marvel's greatest characters, and an invitation for the new characters. The plot follows after Infinity War and does almost exactly what you'd expect. Not that it's a problem, that's fine, because you feel so accomplished being right for once. The performances were well done and the musical score was about what you'd expect from an Avengers movie. My only big problems involve more spoilerish parts so I won't say them here. What I will say, is go see it for yourself. Only you can decide if it's the best Marvel movie ever made. I, will say no. But, if you think it is, all power to you. The ending will surprise you, the story will grab you, so make sure you prepare for this 3 hour adventure."
4565,"Absolutely loved everything about this movie. It gave me everything I hoped for, and much more. After 11 years and 22 movies, this is the finale where everything comes together. Three hours is a long sit, but I would gladly sacrifice my ass to watch a bit longer. God bless you Stan Lee. Eat that DC."
4566,Avengers:Endgame is a superhero film we all yearned for after the Infinity war spectacle and The Dark Knights standard but this film surely was far beyond expectations and was gripping entertaining humorous and emotional. Yes the movie kicks off to a slow start about the Avengers still learning and moving on from their loss but they found a way to reverse the ruins. Thanos the mad titan and the villain again proved to be one of the best villains abd surely some competition for the Avengers. It is a movie which will stun you This movie is a Perfect 10/10
4567,This movies packs a punch from every single Possible or even impossible angel ! Whats great is that they have managed to capture every single emotion and yet maintained the comical nature of even at the worst of times ! Only thing is where do we go from here .. marvel movie clanders were like religious events for most of us in the last 11/12 odd yrs which is now part of our lives !!! Where do we go from here ! How do you top a movie of this magnitude! We are just lucky to be around for this !! Good bless marvel studios
4568,It was everything i wanted it to be and more Well done marvel
4569,Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.
4570,"This is a worthy follow up, one of the most action packed, emotional, and well made movie in such a long time! Every actor is at their BEST! And when a scene hits hard, it REALLY hits hard. Great Effects are also showcased throughout this film. Their is a reason that this movie is blowing up, because fortune favors the bold![換行字元]Bohemian Rhapsody"
4571,Yes it is flawed.But the movie is fantasy and sometimes you just have to sit down and enjoy the film for what it is.The film is stunning to watch and it is great to see the characters at there most weakest and then to see them turn it around. Then to see the characters get the send off they deserve.Thank you marvel for the journey and here's hoping for another great epic journey in the future
4572,"The first hour burns slowly, and necessarily so; this explosion demands a fuse. Endgame allows its earlier pieces, informative and compelling, to interlock before the machine can really begin. When it does, the screen is electric, and each hero's story culminates in a glimmering, if not admirable, finish. I'm not exactly the biggest Avengers fan (more of an X-Men person, if you want to polarise the two), and I seldom review, but this is near inconstestibly stunning. I laughed. I cried. And now I shall remember."
4573,"This is the best movie ever that i had seen.Must watch in theatre. Best experience ever. It's perfect , heart touching, etc (I can't write my expressions in words) #Dontspoilendgame #whatever it takes"
4574,Almost as good as infinity.. But hey.. You gotta see it 😉
4575,I'd say the perfect end for this series even if the ending is a little hard to take. There is a ton of action - well made CGI - not too many mistakes in logic and heartbreaking moments.[換行字元][換行字元]I'll miss it waiting for a continue.[換行字元][換行字元]If you don't see it the movie in cinema you'll not get the whole beauty of it.

4577,Beautiful Movie 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼[換行字元][換行字元]But i had hope There introducing new Charchterer but not.[換行字元][換行字元]I hope Phase 4 Will also be a good phase
4578,"I remember getting excited like this for Deathly Hallows part 2, but this movie is leagues ahead of that. I've been a fan since the first Avenger film and this is an amazing tribute to all those years. If your not a fan you will not understand some of the characters, references, and some of those subtle jokes referencing past films. Don't listen to reviews from non fans, they don't really understand why this film works. Great film."
4579,"The most shocking heroic movie!On the basis of the first 22 films,this is a perfect ending!"
4580,"'Avengers: Endgame' is a film that manages to serve the 21 MCU films before it in a way that is almost magical, and near perfect. The film does a wonderful job at tying up and concluding so many storylines that have been present throughout the last 11 years and 22 films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film manages to out-do itself and delivers on absolutely gigantic and epic proportions. While the film isn't perfect and there are some slight gripes and nitpicks I definitely have, it is perfectly satisfying in the way it manages to close itself up. 'Endgame' offers a justifiable conclusion that can best be described as epic."
4581,"Definitely, the best movie in the MCU. Despite the fact that in the beginning I was a little bit confuse, then the puzzle started to win shape. And then, you have a little bit of comedy, a little bit of action, a little bit of everything. I think that marvel made this in just a perfect way!"
4582,This movie is a grand finale for every Marvel fan. Rating this movie to reduce the value of this movie. This movie is not comparable.
4583,"Since 2008's ""Iron Man"" we have witnessed Marvel Studios release a cinematic jigsaw puzzle culminating with ""Avengers: Endgame"", its final piece. We have been introduced to many characters, seen a variety of storylines and invested in the many films the studio has released over this 11-year span. If you have been a complete and loyal fan of these films, Endgame is your ultimate reward. Because of the anticipation, the risk of ruining the many surprises the film holds and the chance of you going into the film with too much knowledge of its plot, I will not divulge a single aspect of its story. I am only going to attempt to give my final conclusions in the vaguest way I can. If you haven't heard, the film clocks in at 3 hours, one minute. A truly daunting and risky gamble of the filmmakers, Anthony & Joe Russo, because no other film of this genre has been this epic in length. In some ways it helps the film and, in some ways, it hurts it as well. The first act of the film, an hour to hour and half, is rather slow paced. It says some things that has to be said as well as sets up many important aspects that will come to play later in the film, but trust me this part of Endgame is not the action roller-coaster that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" was, but it also doesn't involve as many characters and storylines as that film did (something that was many people's chief complaint). The first act could have been trimmed, written at a better pace or even had some more excitement added to it but that isn't my biggest complaint about this part of the film. For me one of my biggest problems with how comic films have been adapted to the big screen is their propensity to alter the very fabric of established characters and rewrite them to become very different than what I knew them to be when I followed them as a young comic reader. Without naming who they are, we find drastic differences and changes with some of the characters. Some I found to be interesting, others I found troubling and one, although done in the comics when I was still reading them, was a big disappointment. I will even go so far as to say how that superhero was treated creatively in the script in this and the previous film, is one of the most disappointing aspects of the films. The film picks up the pace and its entertainment value in the second act, the part of the film I really loved. If I say too much you will have some huge surprises ruined, but I will say if you are a fan of the previous films in the Marvel Universe, it will be a huge treat for you. Throughout the film, a common element that has been persistent in the Marvel movies is the use of humor and this film is no different. The laughs come all thought this film but I think the jokes worked the best during this part of the film. The action picks up as well as the overall pace. Most of the scenes in the section make the movie worth the price of admission. It might be the section of the film that will be please the fans the most and even helps alleviate some of the first acts' mistakes. By the time we get to the film's epic final act you might be a little worn and weary, but trust me when I tell you it is a cinematic achievement rarely seen. Fans will be cheering, and its probably the part of the film I would recommend seeing with other Marvel fans. Like the previous parts of the film, there are some surprises and laughs. But I will also contend that it had one flaw, not enough to ruin the film, but certainly a true complaint and I will just mention it with a hint; the end felt like Peter Jackson directed it. Overall, I will say I would recommend ""Avengers: Endgame"" for obvious reasons, if you have followed the previous Marvel films it is an absolute must see. If you have missed many of the films and are one of the very few that hasn't seen ""Avengers: Infinity War"", I would actually recommend you wait until you know more about the storyline, you will truly be lost. I wasn't dismayed with the film, just certain aspects and smaller details. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a fitting end in many ways and will overall leave you satisfied. Some will probably walk away thinking it is one of the greatest comic superhero films ever made, I wasn't but that's ok. We all have our own taste and opinions."
4584,"SO GOOOOOOD it has every emotion in one sadness, happiness, joy, it has everything there were a few scenes that were a bit cringe but other than that a near perfect"
4585,"First time I've made a review bout a movie and I must say Endgame is Awesome! It pulls at your heart strings and yet gives you the feeling of pride. Cannot fault it at all had everything in it. Beyond what I imagined it to be and more but you have to watch it yourself,you will not be disappointed."
4586,"Marvel has done it again. I won't spoil it but it has everything we've come to love about this franchise. I think only one or two things could change to improve it, but nothing major that's for future! It felt like family on the screen, and the theater filled with avid fans felt like family too. It was a crowning achievement, Stan would have been proud."
4587,"I enjoyed the movie, but it was disappointing. I expected more. The movie was very predictable. But the ""Avengers: Infinity War"" was better though."
4588,The best one yet by far. Not gonna spoil anything just gonna say if you need to loo within the last hour of the film you better per your pants.
4589,"When they started the MCU 11 years ago, I was pretty skeptical and thought that it wouldn't last. I was wrong. I was very wrong back then. Making 22 movies in 11 years and sharing one universe is one thing, but the ending to that era is another. Growing up with MCU changes me on how I see the sharing universe works on real life. The way they ended a saga is pretty darn good. Everything about this movie is pure excitement and you will be wanting more even after 22 movies. That three hours felt like hour and half for me. This movie made me realised that the movie industry are keep getting better through the years. Perfect ending for The Infinity Saga!"
4590,End of the game End of the game End of the game End of the game End of the game End of the game
4591,"Endgame is some of the greatest fun I've had in the theater. Everything in the past 21 films comes together to make this film the best finale it can possibly be. This three hour epic is brimming with sheer suspense, hearty laughs, exciting action, fitting sendoffs to the characters we grew to love and charming revisitations of the universe's finest moments. It's an excellent balance of fan service and emotionally-driven storytelling. There's so many moments that choked me up, got me pumped and blew my expectations away. That said, the film does pose some noticeable inconstancies with the universe's timeline and raises unanswered questions, but everything else is so tremendous that I can easily overlook them. Endgame is a beautiful culmination of the past 11 years. Take my word for it: It's amazing. The end of an era, but the start of a new one."
4592,"Perfection=Endgame But now after watching this film i realized that its ended the saga of avengers is finished.But this movie is the best movie that you will see in your life and its even beyond your expectation .Its ending is going to touch your hearts and i controlled myself not to cry .I wanna thank the cast of avengers,directors,producer,writer for giving the once in a lifetime movie that this generation will ever see. Love you iron man (Robert) Love you cap(cris evans) and finally i want to say this that i did cry after watching this film"
4593,What have all these peeps seen in this movie i was soooo bored i fell asleep its a waste of3 hours of my life...pls dont waste ur 3 hrs on this

4597,Wouldn't chance a single moment of this film absolutely Perfect!
4598,"Avengers: Endgame is the fourth Avengers film, the sequel to Avengers: Infinity War, and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

It's the perfect ending for my favorite characters.[換行字元][換行字元]I didn't walk out of this nearly as excited as I walked out of Infinity War. But that wasn't because the movie's bad, no, the movie's excellent. I was just too heartbroken.

That is something that no other movie franchise has achieved.[換行字元][換行字元]As for the movie itself, I couldn't ask for anything more.

4602,"After watching this movie I had to wait a few hours before writing this review because of how drained I felt after. So many characters and so many moving pieces unite for a visually stunning finished product that wraps up decades of works from thousands of people.[換行字元][換行字元]Honestly, it was all a lot to take in. The many twists and turns and careful attention given to each character made me think this would be much more manageable as a mini series or even a full season of a TV show. Since that is not commercially viable, we have an elongated character-driven action film that tries to focus on over 20 characters and their emotions and motivations.[換行字元][換行字元]Since we have been introduced to these characters before, we feel invested in their journeys throughout this film. These leads to a speedy 3 hour emotional roller coaster ride as we are quickly taken through the many actions of reactions in so many characters in such a tight time frame.[換行字元][換行字元]While the planning and execution of this was done well, I couldn't help but feel that there were many distractions that disconnected me from the story and reminded me I was watching a movie. Matthew Berry from ESPN on a speaking role? Why? Joe Russo as an emotional man in a strange therapy group talking about crying during his date? Why? Referencing films during the movie that some of the actors in the movie actually started in... All of these serve to distract from the final product and the central themes and developments of the plot for very little payoff.[換行字元][換行字元]However, overall this was a well made movie. Great visual effects, a great cast, a well-written story, and good management of all of the central characters. Yet, there were those glimmers throughout the movie that kept poking you to remind you that you were watching a Marvel movie. This, at times, felt like too much. This was a great end to a long and well thought out project. Yet, somehow I don't believe for a second this will actually be the end. It seems like this movies will keep coming out until audiences have had enough, which won't be anytime soon."
4603,It was slow for most of the movie. Infinity War was way better.
4604,"Easily a 10/10, great way to watch all our heroes one last time"
4605,This movie is only made for Marvel fans. Not like the other 21 Marvel movies. They were entertaining every moviegoer.But Endgame will entertain especially Marvel fans.
4606,"What an emotional ride! Delivered. I love the highs and lows. Most intense fight scene ever, ever"
4607,"The culmination of 22 movies and 11 years marvel hits a yet another home run and this one has traveled the distance of all the other 21 films combined. the russo brothers pull of yet another great movie which will be remembered by the masses for ages to come. being the end to the infinity saga, the film ends in a happy as well as sad note where both the things are intensely heart touching. the last 45 to 50 mins of the film is the best part of the whole infinity saga. the hype for the film reaching to the full extend it surprisingly surpasses the expectations by a million times more. the twists and turns and the climax makes people jumping up and down on the seat. the screen time was equally satisfying for all the characters and completes all the story arcs and most of the loose ends of previous films. the only regret is the lack of post credit scene, this film will leave you in tears of joy and pain from all the jokes and the heart breaking parts of the fim... no spoilers will be given on my side and so the people should follow #DontSpoilTheEndGame #WhatEverItTakes #Avengers #InfinitySaga"
4608,The Best Marvel movie ever seen. Emotional and comedy and Goosebumps scene... Go watch in theatre

Honestly, as well, if I hadn't seen it, and Infinity War was the final of the series, I might be happier with that. That said, this film is more entertaining than sitting in a dark room doing nothing, and it does actually conclude the Avengers storyline, it doesn't conclude in a great way, but it concludes. I feel that Marvel movies have suffered since the loss of Stan Lee, and have certainly lost their neutral integrity, allowing certain political ideologies to take priority on screen, at points, over internal logic or entertainment value."
4611,"This movie was really great. It was just, amazing. They used those 3 hours well. It was just amazing! It made me laugh, cry, also got me on the verge of my seat. Thats why i'd totally recommend it. The ending wasn't perfect for me, but the movie was awesome overall."
4612,"Great movie, stood up to my expectations. Almost felt like the battle from Game of Thrones and I ve never felt that it was a 3 hours movie. I laughed, I cried and I was so caught in the storyline that I almost forgot i was at the cinema."
4613,"This is the BEST LIKE LEGIT BEST MOVIE,GO WATCH IT,3HRS SO BUY EXTRA POPCORNS,Movie Very Interesting And story was ""sweetttt"" Perfect for small Kids aged 8 Above to watch!!"
4614,"Endgame was a great way to end an amazing 11 years. I loved every second of it. Usually I'll disagree with some moments, but in this one, I loved every single second."
4615,"One Of the best movie of all time,i watch it 7 times and still feeling awesome. What a experience of my life. Everything just perfect. Must see movie."
4616,If you don't watch it you are seriously missing out!
4617,"This movie just tops off a 10/11 year story in a fantastic way! This films gives gives you laughs, sad moments and excitement moments. It is truly is a piece of genius. (The Russos should of directed the last season of GOT) Hats off to all the people involved in this story actors, directors and all the people behind the scenes. A special thanks to RDJ and Chris Evans. These guys deserve an Oscar. I truly hope the next phase of films continues to the high standards set in the past 10 years."
4618,"Honest opinion: This movie was made tot destroy the series. A total disappointment. Despite the fact that it's lacking action (first 2 hours you are going to take a nap), the movie single scope is to erase Marvel."
4619,This is the EPIC story telling with all the outstanding performances of all stars for final push. Some questions having in the movie in Endgame. But at last you will see that the most amazing battle like never before. I don't care I am watching this again for me this not Endgame of the movie....[換行字元][換行字元]It time to change the your your self because this is the beginning of the Pashe 4....
4620,"There is love, pain, sacrifice, friendship, loyalty, heartbreak...."

4622,"This movie was incredible, it did everything I wanted it to do and every character had their time to shine, the film was the culmination of 22 MCU films and ten years of buildup and the film pulled it off beautifully. This film could have turned out as a mess if it was in the wrong hands, but the Russo brothers have masterfully pulled off an awesome and emotionally satisfying finale to the Avengers franchise and MCU series even though we are getting more films with ""Spider-Man: A Long Way From Home"" coming out later this year[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, the film was everything it needed to be and the hefty 3 hour run time was definitely more than necessary. The film did everything I expected and much much more, closing a chapter on pop culture history and a franchise loved by billions, it was as close to perfect as a film like this can get"
4623,This MOVIE is the my best one in HISTORY and Marvel has been doing great job since day one. You will certainly know this if you are a real Marvel FAN. #Avengers_Endgame
4624,"Wow. Wow. Wow. From beginning to end, I couldn't think of a better ending to one of the greatest sagas of our lifetime! The writing was perfect and well paced. You had your expected comedy from a Marvel Studios film, but man when it took a turn, you were in for the ride of your life. I laughed, I gasped, and yes, I cried...a few times. Real tears. So emotional. I'm not sure any range of films could have or ever will culminate in anything close to this. Kudos to the actors who we took this ride with over the last 10+ years and of course to the Russos."
4625,"Due to the most recent release of Avengers: Endgame, the writer of this review has abstained from writing the movie review of this movie"
4626,"Although we never get to see the more practical aspects of a rapture-like disappearance of half of all living creatures from the universe, we do get to see some obvious indicators that something is no longer right, existentially. For example, people have let their lawns go to weeds, no one figured out how to play baseball with half the teams, and everyone is afraid of dating, presumably out of fear that Thanos might snap his finger again to further reduce the dating pool, with a a 50-50 shot of either you or your lover disappearing into wispy-black confetti, like Rip Taylor on a cold and rainy afternoon in January.[換行字元][換行字元]It all begs a few questions, such as why was it not viewed as a positive thing, a Malthusian reprieve from overpopulation and a break from resource competition? Could it not have been the requisite spark for labor to unionize and rebuild a strong middle class, something like what happened in Europe after the Black Death? Seriously, couldn't half the Mets and half the Yankees form one good team to play a team comprised of half the Royals and half the Cardinals? Who is running the nuclear power plants? Why does everyone drive Audis? The Fortnite servers are still up? Why was the 50-50 shot so cruelly applied to Hawkeye? Why not grab the Time Stone first? Were the first 21 movies necessary? Oh, and good thing we still have rats running around storage units, am I right?[換行字元][換行字元]Thor, channeling his inner Moondog, has let himself go to weeds, sad and drunk and fat, playing video games all day with couch buddies. Friends are still important, and the hallmark of real friendship can be hidden in a hard-shell taco.[換行字元][換行字元]End Game comes with some satisfying cameo reprises, a handful of genuine laughs related to butts and pee, some nice and tender moments, and ultimately a time heist which has to go awry somehow, someway, to justify three hours of cinematic universe.[換行字元][換行字元]I keep wondering to myself, why, why does Thanos want to . . . whatever. At least the final moments are filmed brightly enough to understand what is going on, and all the heroes get to play rugby with a magical gauntlet. Or maybe it was Australian Rules Football?"
4627,"Indescriptible, best sensation I've ever experienced in a cinema.[換行字元][換行字元]What a journey.[換行字元][換行字元]Thanks Marvel."
4628,"It took me two sittings to finish, being at least 30 minutes too long.[換行字元][換行字元]Some of the scenes were cringe worthy, but that was to satisfy the fans, not for any real reason for them to be there.[換行字元][換行字元]There were enough interesting ideas, and nice touches of humour, to make it worth watching."
4629,This movie was a true experience. I enjoyed every single second of it. It was epic.
4630,"This movie is exactly why all of us find going to the cinemas such a relaxing, engaging, surreal experience. Great plot, well-timed humor, explosive action scenes, brilliant character developments,a fantastic roller-coaster ride of emotions that will keep you at the edge of your seats as well as one hell of an emotional ending. The perfect way to cap off 11 years of well-constructed storytelling. If you were never a movie person, just watch this and I'm sure you will understand why the film and entertainment industry is more than just a side dish in our lives."
4631,"Among all the scenes in the movie,I really liked the hulk fights and his rematch with Thanos,Hulk smashes thanos and sent him flying like a good,This part of the movie is really awesome specially in my imagination"
4632,"Good story,good theme,really conveyed the theme well. Good scenes... Awsme film....awsme to watch,really good"
4633,"For the first minute i watch this, i see this movie will give a much sad moment, but i think it's not. Sad, happy its perfect timing. What a last movie for the end of phase"
4634,Amazing movie.. And a good ending.. And mr stark #iloveyou3000
4635,Okay I'm waited a long time to watch the movie and I've got to say I'm pretty disappointed first they made two of the biggest stars into jokes thor is a fat sloppy drunk and hulk is a big green Sissy I don't even think Hulk threw a punch everyone wanted to see all the heroes come back and they did but they lost one of the greats at the end could have been so much better
4636,Storyline was quite awful really as much as I enjoy the marvel films
4637,"Well what can I say,this movie will change your life whether ur a fan or not,the word epic is an understatement in every aspect in the movie world I just wanna say thank you for giving us the best thing we could wish for and more Thank you marvel,Russo's,Kevin feige Thank you Tony and Cap,nat,thor,hulk,Hawkeye,fury(the original avengers) and every single one who was lucky enough to take part in that flawless epic journey Thank u for giving us our childhood dreams and a role model to look up to We grew up with u for a solid 11 years ,we lived with you,dreamt of the next movies,laughed and shed tears with you Thanks for the endgame and it's so devastating to see an epic era come to an end But....PART OF THE JOURNEY IS THE END"
4638,Infinity was was better than end game. what you have done with thor is not good
4639,"After watching the premiere, this movie is the best one I have ever seen. The laughter is on another level and also with some emotional moments that made me cry because we are in the endgame now. The way they have assembled all the 21 movies in 1 epic 3 hour screenplay is completely mind blowing and astonishing. The Russo brothers are pure epitome of perfection to showcase MCU at its best. Thank you MARVEL STUDIOS and STAN LEE for giving us such epicness. Some might not like it, might not remember about it but not us - is what I will tell myself even after 10 more years."
4640,"I buy the films I enjoyed, Ragnarok and quite a few of the other May Among others . This one was more of a phone in, yeah it tied up the series, but it really felt like we have to do this to get it done. I can't argue the storyline needed to go the way it did but some of the characters who were immensely powerful , seemed lessened against Thanos .[換行字元][換行字元]There was very little humour or byplay in it[換行字元][換行字元]I look forward to the inevitable internet remake that cuts the last two movies in to one."
4641,Started off slow but got better. Such a sad movie but still amazing.
4642,"8 / 10[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is enjoyable and concludes the previous twenty one movies in a satisfying way. That's not to say the movie doesn't have it's problems. Let's start off with the acting. The acting is remarkable, as long with their lines, with the exception of a few forced jokes on what should have been some emotional moments. Each character was great, especially Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow(Scarlett Johannson). The only character I hated in this movie was Thor as I am disappointed in how weak and goofy they made him. He was a simple device for comedic purposes in the film, no real purpose. For a superhero movie, I am disappointed with the lack of good action scenes during the first two hours. The second act of the film is interesting, but slow, and certain moments can be boring. However, there are also good moments. Marvel has saved the best for last. There were so many moments when the people in the theatre cheered in awe. The last hour was personally my favourite as it had the best action and moments. I recommend watching it at least once. I was able to get past the jokes, boring scenes and lack of action, and managed to enjoy the movie."
4643,"After infinity war, I did not think they could pull off a better twist but they did. They nalied it."
4644,"I'm a big IMDB & Marvel fan but this is my first ever review, which I felt compelled to write after being lucky enough to attend a preview screening last night. This is film making at its absolute best. After Infinity War Marvel could have released an average film and it would still smash box office records. But thankfully the Russo brothers, the writers and the producers have given us the best Marvel movie in the entire franchise to date.[換行字元][換行字元]The 10/10 ratings are fully justified and I know many reviews have already mentioned the 3 hour running time, but it really does fly by. I'm already looking forward to seeing it again!"
4645,"This is one of the most ambitious movies ever put to screen and boy does the ambition pay-off. I can see this movie pleasing both hardcore MCU fans and causal viewers however you at least need to see Infinity war before watching Endgame. The acting, visual effects and overall story were great and will have probably set the bar for all superhero films to come. The only place I could see problems with the film were with the tone and pacing but they were just minor issues that are more than likely to happen with a 3 hour film. This movie is definitely worth the watch and is sure to be an instant classic."
4646,"Saw it opening night. Of course, like all movies, it had its shortcomings but overall a must see and a nice wrap up to a few endings."
4647,I saw it in theaters a few weeks after it came out and I think that it raps up the MCU really well. Overall I think it was just an enjoyable experience and can't wait to see it again.
4648,"Catharsis. Pure catharsis incarnate on screen. What we have here is the conclusion to one of the most ambitious filmmaking ventures since Lord of the Rings and it arguably surpasses it. For 11 years we have been treated with numerous films about the various heroes of the Marvel universe, and it all culminated in last years blockbuster Infinty War. Now I am not saying you have to have seen every single MCU movie that has been released--for goodness sake, there are 22 of them (and still more to come)--but if you have, and you have taken the time to invest in these characters, and especially if you have seen each and everyone of them on the big screen, as I have, then the payoff here is that much more incredible. I am not lying when I say the final act of this nearly 3 hour epic is so damn satisfying especially with every little nuances and sidebar that has been established in films prior. Nothing that has ever come before, nor will anything that comes after will seemingly be able to match the juggernaut that has been the Marvel Cinematic Universe. We all have different opinions on which heroes and stories have been our favorites, but no one can deny what an amazing journey it has been. I so look forward to what the next chapter will bring now that this groundbreaking epic saga has ended. Either way, what we have after 11 years is simply a Marvel."
4649,"Would be great if adam warlock was in it. Nice movie, nothing more, nothing less. Maybe too much expectations."
4650,"An excellent conclusion to the current Marvel legacy. A film that had it all, Epic battle Scenes, a lot of emotions, quirky fun and even some Brains... well at least a bit despite some few logic holes you can oversee though. It must have been the biggest cast of Hollywood stars any movie ever had but I wont give away too much here. Just the central Things.... Robert Downey Jr. gives his possibly best Performance as Tony Stark here. Really great acting from the beginning to the end and he was easily the MVP of the film. Besides him Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner really got to Shine. Especially Johansson has many memorable Moments. Chris Hemsworth showed us a different Kind of Thor which was Refreshing and damn hilarious. Chris Evans was good too, had some really strong Moments. Josh Brolin was once again fantastic however not as brilliant as in ""Infinity War"". Glad to see that Gwyneth Paltrow had a Little more to do again. Surprised that Brie Larson wasn't in it as much as you would expect after her solo Adventure ""Captain Marvel"" just a month ago. Mark Ruffalo was good and Don Cheadle actually had his best ""Avengers"" appearance here. Paul Rudd was a lot of fun too. I loved how they generally approached the Story and found the perfect way to continue the very dramatic final of ""Infinity War"" offering us many even more dramatic Moments and full of surprises one would not see coming. Technically it was very outstanding too. Visually absolutely top. A film you really want to see again after it was finished and dont worry About the length... you really dont want it to end because there are so many great Moments in the film that totally keep it alive."
4651,"To keep this short and sweet, Avengers Endgames is one of the most visually pleasing movies of the year next to Alita Battle Angel. But what stops short is the political messages driven into this movie. Socialist activist, people who cry over star wars trailers and folks who say the world will end in 12 years will love this movie and won't miss a beat. But for those who are more attune and aware of forced idealism in entertainment to push across a progressive narrative may find it overpowering and in your face a certain moments. Other aspects left me a little disappointed as well, but not enough to get up and leave the theatre. Also to eveeyone giving this ten stars. Check out their activity and user names. Someone is really trying to boost this movie."
4652,"This one star review is necessary to bring you sheep back to reality. This movie was a boring mess and a major letdown. Infinity War was far better, and that isn't saying much. All of these Marvel films except for a handful out of the 22, 23, however too many have been made-have the same feel by the time credits roll. The MCU's true legacy is showing how if a studio can keep audiences laughing, they'll shut their brains off and ignore the inanity (inanity not insanity, clarification for the lemmings) in front of them."
4653,Worst film of all time in the whole film industry.the most over hyped film ever in the world.absolutely disastrous and useless movie.
4654,"I was sitting next to my cousins so I tried to cover my eyes from them when I was teary eyed. I'm pretty sure they saw. Endgame is simply just a gem. You think that one avengers blew your mind and then they come out with this one. I don't want to spoil the movie, I'm just gonna say stop reading reviews and go watch and cry for your self."
4655,"It just doesn't. It's not that this is a bad movie. It's entertaining and nostalgic. It also does cap off the story in a good way. However, there were a bunch of fan theories online before this movie came out that would have made for a far more interesting adventure. Captain Marvel did not need to be there and I think that Disney made a huge mistake with that character (and, especially, ""actress""). I'm not going to spoil anything, so I'll just leave it there. Worth a watch, sure. Infinity War was hundreds of times better in story and execution."
4656,"Avengers Endgame is about the remaining Avengers trying to get the world back to normal. They run into many problems though.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers Endgame was a great movie. First, the acting was great. All the actors in this movie did a great job. The story was also great. It made me feel like it wasn't 3 hours. All the story telling made it feel like the movie wouldn't have been as good without some of the story. Also the acting was great. I know it has been in most of the films but I still had to congratulate it. There was also many great scenes in this movie. The ending was just really moving and awesome.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, Avengers Endgame was a great movie."

4659,I have never seen such a amazing movie. So many moments took my breath away.
4660,"This was the most amazing movie of it's time. Showing us the possibilities of upcoming MCU Movies, i would like the Stark saga to keep going with the young child..."
4661,"The only good thing about this movie is the nostalgia of old marvel movies,the time travel logic is stupid and its extremely boring just 2 hours of people morning then 45 minutes of cgi,its a disgrace to movies for this movie to be this high"
4662,"Man this movie is just awesome. Its funny , full of action and emotional hell lot of emotion. Booked 1st show of the day and can't get it out a my head. Surely Marvel doesn't disappoint ( never). Its a proper justice to Avengers Franchise."
4663,This movie is so long and boring don't understand where the hype is! Not any close to infinity war! Senseless! Please save your 3hrs! Trust me
4664,"I would be lying if I said that I wasn't a little disappointed. The Avengers: Endgame has been one of the most anticipated movies since... well since The Force Awakens but that was way back in 2015 and in this day and age that's like a million years ago. The point being: Endgame was the talk of the town since all of those beloved MCU characters faded away. Infinity War was such an epic movie what could Marvel do as an encore? Or better still, what could Marvel do to conclude the magnificent journey they took us on?[換行字元][換行字元]If anything, Endgame proves that it's hard to write a perfect ending. Perfect endings are stuff of legend. Whether the ending has a twist, a ride off into the sunset, or a mixed bag they are hard to write and hard to execute. Endgame is supposed to be just as the title suggests: the end. This is where the Avengers wrap it all up. Endgame was one long goodbye and it seems they tried to make it as heartfelt and dramatic as possible.[換行字元][換行字元]Infinity War started with a bang and ended with a bang. It was a fast moving roller coaster throughout. It came together so nicely with all the different characters, the different tasks, and the different battles. It was a superb blend of flavors that came together for an excellent meal. Endgame, on the other hand, was almost like a decompression. If you were huffing and puffing from Infinity War then Endgame was a chance for you to rest, catch your breath, and absorb all of what happened. It was a long slow exhale with just one last burst of energy before retiring. And it wasn't what I was expecting.[換行字元][換行字元]Not that getting what one expects is necessary to be considered good because sometimes you can be surprised in the best way. After all, we've trusted Marvel thus far so no reason not to trust them to put the finishing touches on their masterpiece. Now that I've seen their final brush strokes and the completed work I have to say that their hand slipped a little when adding the finishing touches.[換行字元][換行字元]Like a fireworks show or a symphony I wanted the ending to be this huge crescendo. I'm not talking simply about the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, but the entire movie. I wanted to see all of the fine Marvel characters in their finest form, or close to it, as they went for their last hurrah. I wanted them all to be like John Elway retiring after his second Super Bowl, retiring on top, not Muhammad Ali who held on too long and had a less than flattering exit from boxing. But that's not what I got.[換行字元][換行字元]We got to see heroics, of course it's a superhero film, but it was so subdued. The entire tone of the movie was muted. It was a somber morose three hours. The humor wasn't as humorous. The fighting was somehow less awesome. Everything was just darker and more lifeless. Even the hero moments which were supposed to evoke the most joy, awe, and righteous triumph didn't quite do it. Now it could be because it was 12 a.m. by the time the movie wrapped up and I was tired but I don't think that was it. Many a movie has revived me due to it's captivation. End Game didn't revive me or stir me in the way I thought it should. If anything, they put me to rest along with the Avengers saga. I was going for a conclusion, yes, but I also wanted reinvigoration and revival. Sadly, I got solemn and subdue"
4665,"It was just.. wasn't for me I guess? Avengers: Endgame is an epic tale of a closing chapter in the Marvel universe, presented as a serious movie with Marvel puns, gags and CGI heavy battles. The film tries to reinforce the fact, that what happend in IW is serious and the 3 hour long screen time makes you wander: Is this good or bad? 1 hour or so is about bragging about what happend at the end of the Infinity War, superheroes whining about their existence like ""we shouuuuuuuld doooo somethiiiiing"" but nothing happens for most of the part. I tried to like it, really but as a comic book movie, it was just pure fan service and good CGI with a lot of pointless scenes where everything is too explained. What I would like to point out that, IW was much better. It was a comic book movie, tried to be what it is and at the end it turned out to be much more. This, feels like the opposite. This film wants to be the ""much more"" part and at the end, it remembers that it is a comic book movie. There was a grand battle at this movie which reminded me to Anchorman where everyone from everywhere comes to battle along the heroes. It was so.... not serious at all? I don't know...[換行字元][換行字元]If you are a Marvel fan, go out and watch it. You will have fun 100%. Anyone else, just try to like it, like I did..."
4666,"Just perfect.The storyline is amazing and especially how they connected it with the Infinity War.It creates strong feelings.How the story is evolving with the plot twists and all that makes a perfect development.And of course the effects,the sound e.t.c is awesome too.Definetely a must-watch movie."
4667,"As someone who has grown up with these movies, being only age 11 when it all began to now be only a week away from my 22nd birthday, this one was always going to be emotional. I think I may have underestimated how emotional though.[換行字元][換行字元]Following on from Infinity War which was composed so beautifully to allow each character their time to shine, the Russo brothers were able to keep this momentum going, this time with a specific focus on the original six. Despite the fact that we have seen these characters grow for over a decade now, the film delved even deeper into each of them and allowed us to see yet another side to our beloved superheroes. Endgame is inevitably full of emotion and heart and on many occasions, you'll find yourself shifting from laughter to tears and back to laughter within a matter of minutes. However, the Russo brothers and countless other creators do recognize when it could be 'unsuitable' to throw a joke in at certain pivotal moments and so they let us have our moment to really sit with these characters who have been a part of our lives for so long now to process what we and them are going through.[換行字元][換行字元]Robert Downey Jr said that 'the last eight minutes of that movie are maybe the best eight minutes in the entire history of the whole run of them' and without giving too much away, I have to agree and say it is the ultimate pay off. In recent years, there have been many instances of film and television falling weak towards the end and leaving audiences deflated after spending so much time invested with them. This is not the case with Endgame, it pays homage to the entire MCU and will keep every fan satisfied and at the same time as giving us brand new fights, jokes and friendships to sink our teeth into, it also provides the ultimate feeling of nostalgia.[換行字元][換行字元]Ultimately, a part of me would have liked to have seen even more of certain characters, but upon reflection, it was only right to have our original six be given centre stage. The time for other characters such as Ant Man, who really came into his own in this film and Captain Marvel to take this spot will come soon enough. Although it is not a final farewell to the Marvel franchise, it is to some of the beloved storylines we have spent so long following and despite how heart-breaking it is, I could not have wished for a more beautiful ending. Thank you Marvel."
4668,"Overall, I'm very satisfied with this movie. It was incredibly ambitious, taking risks that I didn't think it could possibly take. It was also obviously emotional being that this is a goodbye to some characters and a huge story line that has been set up since 2008. This movie also has the most epic final battle that I've seen in any movie, and anybody who sits through that wont be disappointed.[換行字元][換行字元]With that being said, this movie definitely has some pacing problems. There were some moments that kind of lagged. And while this movie takes some risks, not all of them pay off. To be honest, some of the risks this movie took with the plot kind of left me a little confused., but the good out ways the bad and we've gotten a very satisfying conclusion to an incredible group of movies."
4669,"Lucky to have watched it in the very first preview, not going to be spoiling things, but people you are witnessing a conclusion of 22 Movies, you can't be fair enough while Judging, unless you have seen the efforts of 10 years of Experience in making best stories to best movies, believe that or not, if you saw the rest movies and have an idea of what every character represents you will deeply appreciate that movie, and easily say it worth 15/10, so many sacrifices, so many happiness, joy and laughter, best cinema experience among all competitors, finally gotta say, MCU rocks all the way, after a low hit in Captain Marvel, they hit back in a way to blow your mind Planet Earth, enjoy the peace of art"
4670,"This film is the film to rap up 22 films and wooow does it pull it off in such amazing fashion.The film has breath taking visuals and amazing characters from thanos to iron man you feel a sense of achievement of being with this franchise for nearly 11 years, but the one of the only problems which is not a spoiler is the film length I went to the midnight screening and at some parts I felt I had been in that cinema for a day[換行字元][換行字元]This film hits great emotional notes I'm not a person who feels sad in films but this got me. I think this is the second best superhero movie trailing behind the dark knight[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers endgame is the film so far of the year it trumps captain marvel it's great fun there are some hilarious scenes I hope you all enjoy it"
4671,"Wonderfully written script, and Chris Hemsworth must take the Oscar for supporting actor this thor performance."
4672,The avengers end game is an absolute thriller and given the best ending to the series as the Russo brothers said🙌🙌
4673,"A masterclass to culminate 21 movies. If you are a fan of the MCU, appreciate all it has to offer, and are open to what comes around the corner, then this movie delivers on all front. Multiple viewings necessary in order to fully grasp to shear monstrosity that is a Endgame. You will laugh, cheer, shake with adrenaline, and cry. Thank you Marvel and the Russo brothers, this was fun."
4674,"I won't give anything away. My wife and I saw the movie in the Netherlands on opening Wednesday morning. It was everything we hoped it would be. If you had been following the You-Tuber's theories (based on trailers) about what might happen, they were mostly off-base. The movie was as excellent as I could have hoped for, from opening scene to closing seen. Seriously, though, bring tissues with you to the theater. Those theater napkins are not easy on the nose and eyes."
4675,"With a runtime of 3 hours it blew by so quickly. Watching it in a packed theater for the first time was fantastic. We all laughed, gasped, jumped, and fell silent in unison. From the residual laughter after a funny scene to the soft sobs of people processing the deaths; we all shared in the viewing of a true masterpiece.[換行字元][換行字元]The acting was fantastic.

4677,"Must watch for everyone. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry. And the thrill, you shouldn't miss it."
4678,"Even whilst watching it, I felt disappointed: slow, wordy, sloppy storyline. Even the final battle was excessive to the point of tedious: too much fast cutting and too many unnecessary characters. Despite enjoying and appreciating most of the Marvel films, I felt this was a letdown."
4679,"Best movie I've seen so far. Although it was 3hrs long, the time passed so fast and the movie was great overall. I loved the plot twists and Thor was amazing."
4680,"It was painful to watch this movie as it reached its conclusion. Great movies don't need a happy ending. Infinity War was a perfect example. Endgame, however, left me 10 times sadder. Sad, bored, annoyed and disappointed. No need to state the reasons, as many reviewers before me properly did that.[換行字元][換行字元]What amazes me though is how the Russos did a fantastic job with movies like The Winter Soldier or Infinity War and came up with this grotesque finale. I cannot conceive any reasonable explanation, other than Disney having a hidden malefic plan to slaughter great franchises (for Star Wars they decided to go with a slow painful process). Whatever it takes, right?"
4681,I have seen this movie for up to three times. This is exactly what I wished for. A masterpiece concluding all the marvel movies in the decade. I'm hoping the MCU can continue and bring us more fun! A perfect ending overall!
4682,"Avengers: END GAME. It is the best Foursquare in history, the film starring a large group of stars, and the film was able to recruit actors in a wonderful way. The film has a quantity of action, drama and comedy, all were more than wonderful. Each term is meaningless and deserves an evaluation of 10/10"
4683,"After the defeat by Thanos (Josh Brolin) -in the 2018 Infinity Wars - who used the Infinity Stones to wipe out trillions of the world's population, the Avengers come together to put things (people) back in the world and in doing so they realize some sacrifices must be made.

4684,"Thanks Marvel and Disney, for all these years. Can't wait to see the phase 4."
4685,The story here was done to perfection. Too bad it had to end but really a good movie
4686,The best Marvel movie so far! Perfection at its best!
4687,"Disappointing end to a great series where the end just left the viewer deflated and feeling meh. The 3 hour story was very drawn out, maudlin and characters lacked the personalities and substance of the previous movies. The story was also disjointed where it seemed to jump ahead of itself and lacked continuity. The was little or no action and when the big end came it was a few minutes of mediocre fighting flicking to quickly between a few characters. Has to be one of the worst Marvel movies ever and ranks up there with the worst of the Highlander sequels."
4688,"Good but this has the most problems out of any phase 3 marvel film. Time travel is cheesy, none of the acting was EXCEPTIONAL except for RBJ. They didn't know what to do with Thor or hulk but they didn't really focus on them too much so its fine. Captain Marvels character is terrible. None of the time travel stuff makes sense and they keep breaking rules. Why is CA on the bench I thought it created an alternate timeline. When nebula was caught why didn't she GET OUT OF THERE. Your particles still work LEAVE. Why can't Captain Marvel snap the gauntlet, she's the strongest avenger. Anyway it was still good, it's kinda just pros vs cons but it was fun (except for the first two acts)."
4689,I dont know what to say. Its perfect way to end the Avengers. Let stars talking
4690,"Over the last few years I have seen quite a few films including all 21 Marvel Cinematic Universe Films so I was unbelieveably excited for Avengers: Endgame and I have to be honest this is my favourite cinema experience of all time. As a casual fan you can enjoy this film but as a person who has been such a huge fan of this universe since the first Iron Man this film is executed absolutley perfectly. This is also the hardest film to review ever as nobody should have this film spoiled for them and the trailers have been incredibly vague but I will give it a go. So the premise of the film is set after the events of Avengers Infinity War and sees the Avengers attempt to fix the destruction that Thanos caused in that film. Now the cast is absolutley huge but I am only going to talk about a few so this review isn't really long, for fans of Chris Evans as Captain America who were disappointed with his role in Infinity War, they will be pleased with his role in this film as he is excellent and at the forefront. Similar to this Robert Downey Jnr as Tony Stark is obviously fantastic and totally owns the role, Chris Hemsworth as Thor & Scarlet Johansson as Balck Widow are great in their huge roles. But i wanted to talk about some suprisingly great perfromances, this is easily the best Jeremy Renner performance as Hawkeye, he is a damaged character and has way more depth to his performance in this film. Paul Rudd as Ant-Man really works in this ensemble cast, his style of humour really fits well with the other Avengers and was a great balance to the others. Possibly the biggest suprise is Karen Gillan as Nebula who is really fleshed out in this film and I really enjoyed her character arc especially from the first Guardians film to now. For those people that love Josh Brolin as Thanos this film isn't really about him, Infinity War is his film but he is more of a supporting player in this story but he is still great. I can't talk much about the story but it has a perfect mix of drama and humour, also has a great blend of character moments and epic spectacle. That's all I am going to say about the story but it is truly epic. The script is great, with a really good blend with humour and drama you will be laughing one moment and possibly crying the next and that makes this film special. The style just aids in making this film feel truly epic, the action scenes are great and feels different to other Marvel films. Overall this film is going to be remembered as one of the greatest of all time, this expereience has hit me emotionally and I have seen this film twice already and I can see myself watching this film over and over to come for many of years to come."
4691,"This film is everything it was hyped up to be. It had everything. Tears in my eyes as I left the cinema. I'm going to watch it again tonight, twice in a day. I've never done that before."
4692,I see it and It's really one of the best marvel movies it's an epic literally crowned to be best end of a long superheros series and satisfied ending
4693,"To start off, I am not a mcu fan and this review is completely non biased. First of all, the movie is not bad, nor great in my opinion..it's just an overall good film. The first half of the movie for me was very slow and laggy, however it picks up its pace later on. I haven't watched every marvel movie so I didn't really understand a lot of the references that were made so that was another downside for me. The way they handled Thor kind of disappointed me bcuz he is my fav avenger but it's ok bcuz he was kinda funny. The ending is the best part of the movie because the action, goosebump moments, and emotional scenes were done very well. Overall, I think they could have trimmed a lot of the first half of the movie bcuz 3 hours felt very long when there are a lot of scenes that didn't contribute much to the plot. However, I think mcu fans will definetily enjoy the movie much much more than a neutral like me. It's a good movie, trust me, but not the best. Give it a watch bcuz it won't disappoint you, that's for sure!"
4694,"I always thought it was going to be almost impossible to improve on Infinity War... and I think I've been proved right. This was always going to be a film all about how the good guys could return to winning ways after getting their proverbial @as kicked in infinity war. Yes we probably wanted to see some of the aftermath of half the universe being wiped out....but it didn't need to play out for so long. To be honest I dislike most films when time travel becomes involved...I just think it all becomes a bit ""well nothing really matters as we'll just go back in time and change it"". I've watched infinity war 8 times already... but i just can't imagine ever sitting through this that many times. My honest opinion is it's too long....some of the main characters are just either disappointing or none existent. Another issue..if you have a character as powerful as Captain Marvel the rest of the squad become a bit redundant...unless you a again decide to send her to the other side of the universe. Some people will kid themselves that this is the peak of the whole journey.....its not...it already happened in infinity war."
4695,"This movie is great, funny, sad, epic, profound and nostalgic, but it is not awesome. The problem begins with some characters as Thor, this hero has nothing to do with the Ragnarok version, the nearest look to the God of thunder appears in their previous movies, I loved the first two Thor movies, a hero with his ups and downs, egotistic and shallow. But everything change in Ragnarok, this guy is almost a joke in comparison with his previous version. The same occurs with the End game version of Thor, the only hero that not change every time he appears is Captain America. The other problem that I have with this movie is the saturation of characters, the directors split the exposition time for every hero in almost nothing compares with the movie length (181 minutes). Even so, I think that Avengers End game deserve a 9 of 10 grade, I hope you can enjoyed as much as I did."
4696,"More emotional than infinity war, fight scenes still good though, writing is a little more reliant on plot devices compared to the previous film but they throw in a good amount of comedy"
4697,Must watch 5-6 times. Great movie ever made. Stan Lee was really great.
4698,"Best Film, i've ever seen!!!! High Emotions with an perfect und suprising Story!!![換行字元][換行字元]A Masterpiece in the MCU and an Masterpiece in the whole Film World!!!!"
4699,Love everything bout this movie. Newest member Captain Marvel is now my favorite! Her entry in the war is marvelous. You could see her strength ! Thanos couldn't punch her without the stone. Love love love. Iron man will be in our hearts forever ❤ I didn't feel much pain for black widow but on iron man I was like crying
4700,"If you only allow to watch one movie for the rest of your life then look no further. No more word needed, go and see this movie now!!!"
4701,"Absolutely incredible. Every second is emotional, full of laughs and tears. Make sure you watch a the movies before to really appreciate it!"
4702,I cant talk much about this movie ...It was just too good
4703,Was not a fan of Marvel but gradually I love the works so much and this endgame did veery good i love it
4704,"Every little bit of it carefully thought out, skillfully written, masterfully acted. It's a superhero action film that doesn't shy away from our run after clichés. It just gives them a knowingly superior look and moves past them. It's more than you expect and at the same time exactly what you expect. Cinematic magic."
4705,"Most enjoyable movie, with emotional touch and with lots of wow elements."
4706,Can't complain. Loved the movie. Lots of action and story lines. A lot to keep up with but things tie together nicely. Worth the wait.
4707,Best movie of 2019 Top movie grossing in the world
4708,One of the best from Marvel. Hope Phase 4 will be awesome. Thumbs Up. Keep it UP !
4709,"I love the ending very much! And I cried so many time. It's so good to live in these Marvel's years! I am going to watch this masterpiece one more time, maybe third, fourth......Times! Thanks Marvel Thanks Stan Lee Thanks Russo Bro. Thanks Avengers! #Nospoiler #Respect"
4710,No amount of words can explain this rollercoaster of emotions 😱😱😱😱😱😱
4711,"This last avengers movie is epic, everything is just fantastic except of course the finale :( don't reveal the events of the movie, this movie deserves to be no.1 of all movies."
4712,Poor character development[換行字元]a lot of unnecessary characters that barely have a line[換行字元]weird pacing[換行字元]last act was pretty much a reenact of IW where they actually win
4713,"Solid 3 out 10.[換行字元][換行字元]They had one job. Create a great action movie without involving politics.. Really it must've been extremely hard to write a good ending to this series. I did like parts of the ending, but trying to shoehorn in a political message and the additional character cpt marvel just felt so forced and ridiculous it just made me cringe. There was one scene in particular, and you will know which one I mean when you watch it. A real shame. It's like the writers were forced to include an element that they really didn't want to have.."
4714,"The rumors are true: you'll laugh, cheer, and will probably cry several times because I did. A middling first 2 hours that's equal parts cool moments and problematic ones that ends with a final hour that's a downright divine geek wet dream. More character-based than action-based (Infinity War). It is a satisfying send-off and a beautiful love letter for the fans. Salute to the founding members- the OG 6. I love you 3000, Avengers. Thank you, Marvel and Russo Brothers!"
4715,"I know everyone wouldn't like the movie. There are some who still find flaws and compalin! Irrespective of every words, it is loved by so much. And it definitely would put a smile in your face You will cry, you will laugh, you will be surprised, you will be engulfed in a total cinematic journey. Thank you Marvel, Stan Lee, Ruso Brothers and every other cast from RDJ, Chris Evans, Hemsworth to Paul Rudd."
4716,Though I have some issues with the way the last few years went with the Marvel universe (like the moronic identity political game they try to sell to us) this one was different while it is still there its easily looked over by the pure emotional build up that has been going for 11 years. I stand here saying that when I first saw iron man in theaters I could have never dreamt of such a thrill ride like this and with a near perfect ending.
4717,"Okay after reading such amazing reviews for this film.I came to see this Film with anticipation that it will top all of the mcu movies,but for me honestly I think Infinity War is a better movie.But that doesn't mean it's bad,I think you just don't have to hype things and left dissapointed , but I was never dissapointed.This movie has a problem on pacing, it was slow and it looks boring, but hey! I was never bored because that is what this movie needs.Slow pacing and build up to an 2nd act and 3rd act of insanity.The characters are not just characters they are very human here ,so vulnerable and full of mixed emotions. The action scenes were really good and this movie is just pure enjoyment and will easily be in my top 5 favorite mcu movies but not better as Infinity War in terms of being a movie.(for me)and surprisingly Captain Marvel is better here than in her own solo movie and this movie is more emotional than Infinity War.Because two movies are presenting different emotions for it's audience to feel.This movie is such a beautiful experience."
4718,"Let's be clear on one thing: While Marvel is almost always entertaining and fun, it's generally not ""good filmmaking."" Good filmmaking is having good cinematography, acting, a complex plot that's more than just ""good guy fights bad guy"", or ""guy and girl fall in love"", and emotional depth, among other things. Marvel is fun, but its movies generally don't have all-if any-of these things. Now, they finally have done it.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers: Endgame is a terrific conclusion to an incredible cinematic achievement-building up 21 films all to this point is really amazing-and it features brilliant emotional depth, some great performances, and an excellent script and plot. The work of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely on this film is excellent-the screenplay is exciting, witty, and even emotional. The performances of Robert Downey Jr. and Jeremy Renner are absolutely astounding-brilliant acting by both, and there are great supporting performances by Josh Brolin, Paul Rudd, Scarlett Johnansson, Chris Hemsworth, and Bradley Cooper. On the downside, the performances of Evans, Larson, Cheadle, and Ruffalo are, as they normally all are, not good-Evans in particular is especially bad and always has been, and the ending scene is botched, as it contradicts the rules that the movie set for itself. However, the movie as a whole is very good-not perfect, but very good-and marks an epic conclusion to a great story."
4719,"Avengers: End Game can't compete on its own against the likes of The Godfather, Citizen Kane, or The Dark Knight, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has never been about competing on your own. The MCU parallels it's own characters in the sense that it's strength lies not in each individual, but rather the sum of their parts. Avengers: End Game is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the seemingly untouchable Infinity Saga, whose 10 year presence has changed cinema forever."
4720,"I am sort of sorry that the rares time I write a review, it is not a kind one. But I am sorrier still that the rares times I watch theater movies, it is because of high ratings of previous reviewers.[換行字元][換行字元]Yep, that is how i chose this one.[換行字元][換行字元]""Astonishing"", ""perfect"", ""masterpiece"", ""9 out of 10"" were some of the comments and ratings around, so I thought, this must be it, if I have to see one movie this year, it's this one.[換行字元][換行字元]But honestly :[換行字元][換行字元]Special effects, are good.[換行字元][換行字元]Plot is so plain you understand what is going to happen and how it is going to end in the first ten minutes. And there are no twists whatsoever. Everything is pretty much recycled from other movies - not talking about ""avengers"" or marvel series; rather, just any SF movies out there were used as ideas sources to fill this one. Nothing new, nothing different.[換行字元][換行字元]Yeah, there are a few nice jokes, and some fat, both so badly plugged you can see the stitching (you'll understand when you see it). In the past, when heroes were making jokes during a battle, it was to show they mastered the situation, and it was fitting the atmosphere and pace; in this one, you can see at some point the director absolutely wanted to put a joke in the middle of the main battle - broke the rythm and half spoiled the mood just because of that.[換行字元][換行字元]Movie is three hours long.[換行字元][換行字元]I just watched two episodes of an old anime series from the 80's, and in those 46 minutes, there was pretty much as much action and stuff going on than in these almost-three-hours of medium paced show. So although people say it was needed to fit all the references to previous marvel movies, i'd rather have less references and more things happening in this one.[換行字元][換行字元]As it often happens in these follow-ups, previous movies created such an intricate situation that this one solved in such a straight-forward way, it felt as if somebody wanted it rushed to the finish.[換行字元][換行字元]And in order to do that, it took the party of a lousy quantum physics theory (which is actually wrong, btw), and left some important side question unanswered[換行字元][換行字元]And not to talk about the mania from the producers to destroy stuff that went on for décades, or millennia, all in the timespan of a few years! We had ragnarok, the death of Odin.. And now.. this? Well without spoiling the movie for those that want to see it, I'd say it looked like they wanted to make sure that this put an end to the story. Even if that meant to break the logic of these movies : ""Thus far and no further we shall make avengers movies"" God complex, perhaps?[換行字元][換行字元]All in all, it wasn't any better than an old Flash Gordon movie, except for the SFX that are of course more modern. I'm giving it a 3 out of 10, as 1 and 2 are reserved for movies that don't deserve watching till the end. But I believe that once the paid comments and the avengers mania will be past, many other will downrate this, that definitely did not deserve all that advertising and praise it received so far.[換行字元][換行字元]Definitely a cash movie, nothing more."
4721,"Unnecessary emotions, focus on only Captain America and Iron man, Role of Thor is just for joke."
4722,"This one was beyond expectations. I laughed, I cried, I cheered and then cried again and cried hard. I am definitely gonna watch it again. But I need a couple of days to take it all in. 3rd act is a cinematic masterpiece! Visually satisfying. An emotional roller coaster through and through."
4723,Loved this film from start to finish. Satisfying end to the Avengers. Well worth going to see you won't be disappointed.
4724,"There were many moments in which I laughed, and so did the people in the theater. I cried a few times, and so did they. It does start slowly, but it's just one of it's virtues. You'll hope it all was like the beginning of the film. Relatively calm. Because even if it was entertaining and full of emotions, it didn't quite match the rest. You'll leave the theater, and although you'll be satisfied, you'll also beg for more. The movie will stay with you for hours. You'll often remember it at random times. Trust me on this one. I've seen many great, rememberable films and it sure is one of them. It managed to top Infinity War. It ain't only superhero fun, it's also so much more. It drained me emotionally. I can't think of anything else than Endgame two hours after I left the theater. If it isn't the best superhero film ever made, it's sure close. Avoid spoilers at all costs and go see it, you won't regret it!"
4725,Best possible ending to an excellent story line spanning over 10 years...... hope marvel are moving onto phase 4 👍
4726,U should watch this moive or just give a try Or because awesome moves or sudden change Of vfx
4727,I never thought I would like a movie this much until this. #lotsoflove#Ironman#Captain America#avengers
4728,"Don't want to spoil the film, but you get the scope of how big the MCU really is. Or was...[換行字元][換行字元]Mind blown, the mind blown and the, you guessed it, mind blown again. And that's the movie. :)"
4729,First half was really boring. But the climax was really appreciated.overall it's not the Movie we want
4730,"This movie give me goosebump every second, the music the sound the action all perfect Excelsior !!"
4731,"Marvel did a great job of wrapping the story up. Even though cliffhangers are great and all, it's nice to leave a Marvel movie with a feeling of closure (and excitement for what's to come, obviously)."
4732,"My undying passion for films (and other media) always lingered since I was a baby. That being said, my passion for this craft exploded when I saw the Earth's Mightiest Heroe's team up in 2012. Marvel Studios had something special on their hands with The Avengers, then Cap: TWS, then Guardians of the Galaxy, then Civil War.... and so on. They almost always one-upped themselves in terms of quality as each subsequent movie came out. The journey that we experience with these Heroe's is so very special, and I'm grateful for it. I always love visiting these stories every time they put out a film. (Trying my best not to sound preachy here haha!) I know some of this may sound silly, but these heroes have always been important to me. Marvel studios have always delivered (at least for me). They released my favourite film of all time - Infinity War, last year and I really didn't think they had it in them to top it. Lo and Behold, Endgame was perfect. It resonated with me on so many levels. I'm not going to go into specifics, because I don't want to ruin the experience for anyone, but these are the reasons why I absolutely, wholeheartedly love Avengers Endgame: As comics coming to life - there were scenes that EXPLODED my mind. I cheered my lungs out opening night. As a deep dive into characters - I felt the repercussions of the previous event that took place, I love the way they handled ""loss"". I was emotionally taken by the well-written script as well as the acting that carried the perfect slow-pace of the first half of the movie. The characters dealing with the snap in their own ways was executed so well. Connected with them on a whole other level. Loved the pacing of the film. I also love how each character has grown; If you go back to the early movies and then you watch endgame... Our beloved Heroes are fundamentally the same, with we'll set morals, though they've grown for the better over the years and continue to do so in this one. Growth of astoundingly well-made characters you care about should be commended. As for the laughs - there were so many of them, such great ones that landed 95% of the time. Well written comedy that I ate up. I think the comedy this time around was sprinkled in at better moments, that never broke the seriousness of a scene (when compared to something like Guardians 2...). A lot of fun laughs to be had ay! As of the action - FREAKING PHENOMENAL. I Screamed, I Cheered, I Clapped. I tend not to burst out with the above in theatres, but I couldn't hold myself back... Trust me, I tried. So well done. The entire third act is something to behold. As for the music - Alan Silvestri, take a bow. The Avengers theme is so iconic now, thank you for giving that to us. Thank you for using it so well in this film and thank you for creating new tracks that I know I'm going to listen to on repeat. The soundtrack was seamlessly awesome in this film! As for the directing & acting - The Russo Brothers... Alright, I'm not going to say anything more than I have before. You guys are the best, really, how y'all handle these mammoth tasks with perfection is beyond me. The two of you are crazy amazing. The actors brought their A game as always too. The movie focused on the core 6 avengers with a few exceptions here and there. RDJ & Evans took my breath away once again, but PAUL RUDD is a huge standout to me coming out of this. The way he handles his lovable Ruddness brand of humour with so much emotional depth in this film is brilliant. Scar Jo, Renner, Ruffalo, Hemsworth... You guys. I loved all of them, I don't want to pick out any favourites because they all played their roles to beyond perfection. As for the heart - Endgame, after one viewing has become my favourite movie of all time. This movie strung together a fresh, cool, heavy, yet satisfying plot with such care. Characters and Heart make or break a film for me, and Endgame is a prime example of how well the two are executed. I was emotionally drained at the end of the movie. I screamed my lungs off, I laughed my butt off and my lord, I uncontrollably cried my eyes out... Yet by the end of it all, I walked out with the biggest smile on my face. Thank you for this gift Marvel Studios.[換行字元][換行字元]A thing isn't beautiful because it lasts."
4733,"Endgame is the culmination of a more than decade old journey. Finales are often hyped up so much, that the finished result leaves one disappointed.

4738,"This movie was a perfect wrap up to the Avengers franchise. This movie will have you laughing, clapping (more than you think), and of course... crying. When Iron man said in the trailer ""part of the journey is the end..."" he is very true. Go see this movie!"
4739,"Completely overrated movie, infinity wars was a great and bold movie, it built a lot of expectations on an interesting and smart sequel but End game was quite disappointing, I was really expecting a more interesting movie with some twists, but nothing, it was predictable and bland and it didn't make a lot of sense either."
4740,"Just a great movie with lots and lots of fan service, which I didn't mind at all, moreover I was glad that we are finally getting things like this before the series ends. Just don't have words to explain this movie, it's just awesome, just watch it. Some little plot holes and script nitpicks are there, of course no movie is perfect. But this one is just worth what you pay for. It's the grand end that many fans have waited for, and it perfectly delivers what we need![換行字元][換行字元]Such a great experience, people were shouting and cheering, and I wasn't bothered because I was shouting myself, it was just that good for me :D"
4741,"It is indeed a fan-desired perfect end to a superbely balanced cinematic experience. A well hammer-hit nail to the hall of fame of Marvel movies but as a movie on its own it is indeed a 7 for me. As a wise man once put, ""too many cooks spoil the food"" is the perfect epigram to how I felt (mind you) ""watching the movie in it's own original form."""
4742,"Avengers Endgame is an amazing film, full with big character moments as well as epic and hilarious moments. An emotional roller coaster is one phrase you can use. It has an amazing balance of humour and emotion as well as action packed adventure moments that make the audience clap and cheer like hell. I mean seriously people were clapping. While Avengers Infinity War was more of Thanos' story, this one is all about the original six Avengers and the sacrifices they make to bring everyone back. Because if they can't protect the earth, you can be damn sure they'll avenge it. The movie is so rich and full of life and manages to touch on each character so well. The way each character copes with loss of perfectly fitting and has fans on the edges of their seats. These feelings are carried throughout the film, all the way to the end giving each character a perfect arc. For many moments I couldn't stop laughing and in some I couldn't stop crying. The Russo Brothers really overdid themselves on this one. This movie really shows how well Marvel planned their series of movies. Now looking back to the first Iron Man film and all the other original films it is so amazing to see how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together. Although I do suggest watching a few Marvel films before seeing Endgame I do think the movie does a great job at explaining itself and what has happened but not in an overloading way as if it was a recap. Please do not look at spoilers, there are so many surprises and epic moments that just have to be viewed with the whole movie. Overall, it is the best movie I have ever seen. A beautiful culmination of 22 films and so many characters and complex relationships. 3000/10"
4743,The best movie ever made and the final battle was just out of this world thanks to the brilliant cast and direction of Russo brothers
4744,"It's my first movie in US. Practicing my listing for three hours. I didn't expected that there is no subtitle. Only understand 50%, or 30% maybe of the dialogue. However, the action are outstanding, the performance is amazing.[換行字元][換行字元]It's the end of an era, the end of the 22 movies."
4745,Idk . It maybe the best superhero film I ever seen .
4746,Awesome movie worth every penny you spend on it.Awesome movie worth every penny you spend on it.
4747,"The best superhero movie of all time. Excellent film, the best movie of 2019, in my opinion."
4748,"MCU created their best. I got tears in my eyes thinking of that they will not make avengers anymore. The movie contains everything whether its comedy, emotions, fun etc."
4749,"The movie has some comedy moments and some serious moments that barely gave me an heartattack. If you are a resl marvel fan , U garant you that you will cry in the final scenes."
4750,"Avengers: Endgame is an ambitious cinematic extravaganza and a bittersweet culmination to an 11-year journey, yet it overwhelms so much in the final act that the audiences fail to detect its flaws. The more you think about what happened, the more you find problems.[換行字元][換行字元]As I clapped, cheered and teared up with the audiences, I understood how the Marvel Cinematic Universe became a mega-franchise that continued to create fervent fans through the power and charm of its heroes. This has the best final act in a superhero film. I got chills all over my body and my jaw just dropped in awe in the spellbinding moments, especially in the final action sequences. This is like the ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" and ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" of the MCU: a film as epic as the saga it concludes. Not a single cast member wasted this opportunity by giving an awkward performance. Everyone seemed so into it and recognized the pressure of their character to get that single win over fourteen million possible losses. Most of the humor is also brilliantly-placed compared to other MCU offerings that could not crack a joke well.[換行字元][換行字元]In its three-hour running time, the film traverses through a very complicated plot, more complicated than its predecessor. As opposed to the relentlessly brash, unending clash in ""Infinity War,"" ""Endgame"" slows down and takes its time to explore grief and the effects of the previous tragic events to the characters. The plan of the Avengers unfolds detail by detail, from practice runs to jokes. Some of the stretched first act can be cut off such as the one-liners and unnecessary character interactions.[換行字元][換行字元]The film's second act struggled to transition from one mission to another-from one tone to another-which undermined the progression of how a particular mission will conclude. In this ""Back to the Future"" second act, I was ready to deem the film as mediocre and overlong. But once the final battles ensued, the drawn-out build-up truly paid off with action scenes that reminded me of the power of films to create an experience of epic proportions. This is what film as a medium can do, and boy, is it amazing! Terrific action choreography and visual effects in the third act really elevated this film beyond its serviceable middle section.[換行字元][換行字元]""Endgame"" did give satisfying endings for some of its beloved characters. However, as nitpicky as it may sound, directors Joe and Anthony Russo are too much invested in devising an emotional full stop on a character's story instead of creating a cinematically-cohesive science fiction narrative. A character's story ends satisfyingly even if how it happens didn't really make any sense.[換行字元][換行字元]This not how Time Travel works, well if we will consider other popular culture works that explored it. There are a bunch of what can be considered as ""plot holes"" (you can find them online) in its time travel story and character conclusions, most of which is felt when the audience says ""what?"" or ""why is he/she there?"" out of confusion watching a scene. I have read a couple of articles that explained these ""plot holes,"" and none of them really resolved them entirely since the explanations are mostly theorizing based on what was just briefly mentioned in the film. Fans can do all their theorizing, but these ""plot holes"" are problems in the film's depiction of events and ideas.[換行字元][換行字元]Nevertheless, with all its flaws, this is a very strong film due to its sense of awe and ambitious story. Even if I didn't love it 3000, the shock and awe tactic of the Russo brothers still worked.[換行字元][換行字元]P.S. Captain Marvel was so under-utilized in this film. I was waiting for her the entire time."
4751,Not my favorite Spider-Man movie but definitely not the worst. I would say Spider-Man 2 was the worst instalment. Go see this if you have a chance!
4752,"Avengers Endgame literally blew me away. I just came back from the cinema and I am still amazed and shocked from what I have just watched. This movie is full of humour, action, sadness and as well as bringing back memories from the previous MCU movies. Avengers Endgame is the best superhero film yet and is the best way to end the Infinity Saga. It's also gonna be hard to try not to spoil anything!"
4753,"The very best of Marvel, without the cheap filler. Endgame is a near perfection. It's an emotional journey, the culmination of 20 other marvel films. It's hard to understand how the Russo brothers got this oh, so right.[換行字元][換行字元]Gone is the awful comedy from Captain Marvel, none of the boedom from Ant-man and the Wasp. What we get here, to quote Thanos from Infinity War, is ""perfect balance"". There is still humour, but it's generally very well placed.[換行字元][換行字元]It really is the very best of Marvel. There are the awesome set pieces we first saw in Thor: Ragnarok, there's all the fan service you can ask for, but I can't say much more without spoiling the film.[換行字元][換行字元]Even as somewhat of a Marvel skeptic, I really enjoyed Endgame. Even if it does have a few faults. There were a couple of moments that seemed slightly dull. But they were as I say 'moments', remarkable for a 3 hour film. It definitely didn't outstay it's welcome. I wanted more at the end, but I still felt satisfied.[換行字元][換行字元]There were a few long overdue scenes. I particularly enjoyed the moments of service to the female characters of the MCU. They have been well overdue, especially considering characters such as Black Widow, have never had their own feature film, yet still arguably is one of the most badass, pulling some of the wildest fight moves. But it wasn't in your face, it was well placed.[換行字元][換行字元]The film wraps up wonderfully, a real powerful conclusion. And I refuse to say any more. I wish I could argue the finer points of this wonderful film, but I won't spoil it.[換行字元][換行字元]Go and see it, and if you can manage to push yourself through Ant-Man and the Wasp, watch that, then infinity war, first. I wouldn't bother watching Captain Marvel first if you haven't seen it, it's completely unnecessary, and by far the worst marvel movie in years.[換行字元][換行字元]Anyway, go and enjoy this wonderful film. Have fun!"
4754,Best movie ever ❤ 😍 ❤ 💕 i already watched it 5th times 😍😍😍😍
4755,"Avengers EndGame is a masterpiece, absolutely incredible tear Jerking hilarious the perfect superhero movie."
4756,"MCU nails a perfect 10/10 in my opinion. This was awesome... It provides us with humor, little drama, Awesome action sequences, loads of surprises, best storytelling ever, A blast from the past, a perfect well told ending, a satisfying conclusion. I honestly can't wait for the Next 20+ Marvel Should have All 100% creative impute on all Marvel based Movies... They also really love the digitally d-age thingy... I guess make-up to make some one younger isn't cutting it anymore... They pretty much can higher any old actor now because they can digitally d age some one decades younger.... but I'm joking of coarse."
4757,"The film starts to fall apart the more you think about it, but the conclusion to so many wonderful decade-spanning character arcs are so incredibly satisfying. There's so much to like about this film."
4758,"I can't think of any better they could have ended this phase of the MCU. I can only think of a few minor issues with this movie, and if they weren't present, then you have a perfect movie laddies and gentlemen![換行字元][換行字元]From the marvellous performances, to the amazing story, this film just sines in creating an amazing superhero saga. I would say all of the original Avengers gave their best performances yet, which enabled the film to feel more tense, more thrilling and more emotional.[換行字元][換行字元]The film however, played out how I was expecting to be honest, yet, still managed to throw many surprises in there, which I think the first act needed, otherwise It could have turned tediously long. But once all that's over, you have a incredible final act to throw yourself into. I have never felt so driven for the hero's to succeed before in a movie, especially through Captain America (who isn't one of my all time favourites) Thor and Iron man, who all felt like complete bad asses in the third act of the movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Nothing else to say...go see it, enjoy it, I think we all deserved it!!!"
4759,Great link up between superheroes and there films hats of to the entire team great work .
4760,"This is a very weak film that has both good sides and bad sides, a good side is only in the picture and in the humor, everything else is bad, the plot is weak and we repeat ourselves, there are many plot holes, the laws of the universe are violated, sometimes the graphics look very cheap, if the war of infinity is a masterpiece then the endgame is a fan service !!! So bad final((("
4761,One of the best superhero movies. But didn't like it as much as Infinity War or Dark Phoenix.
4762,"What are you waiting for? Go see it now. The thing says my review is too short, so here are some more words."
4763,"The best marvel movie ever, I cannot put into words how amazing this movie is the best👍💯👍💯"
4764,"So when the movie was announced back in 2014 i was excited about it since then and now when it has been released, how can I miss the movie.[換行字元][換行字元]This beautiful piece is created by Russo brothers and they are just good at it. I mean everybody saw the end coming still it was like a surprise for each and everyone in the theatres.[換行字元][換行字元]Has comedy, action, drama, emotions and all most everything that can stick you to the seats without a toilet break.[換行字元][換行字元]Nonetheless the movie gives us a hint of future but most importantly it ends an era and makes the path for new Heroes.[換行字元][換行字元]If you miss this experience in theatres, you miss the half of the Universe."
4765,"Such an Amazing movie from Marvel ! You guys need to watch this movie.. worth to wait, and worth to watch !!! Thanks Avenger !!! You did it !!!!"
4766,"Let's face it: It was the most anticipated movie of the XXI century, thus a lot of expectations for the makers to reach, which is not an easy task.[換行字元][換行字元]I would say they did it, they even surprised us, But was it the ending the way we want it? Mostly yes, and in my opinion it's a very good ending.[換行字元][換行字元]BUT, the lack of action (imagine my kids 2.5 hours without actions...) and the way they show Earth with supposedly ""ONLY"" half the population should have disappeared but looks like 95% disappeared (half is not 95%) made me remove 2 stars on the 10/10[換行字元][換行字元]Is the lack of action exacerbated the movie? No, not for adult as the scenario was well written, but for the younger staying 2.5 hours sitting and expecting action from their favorite super heroes was hard to manage in the cinema... and even for me, though ;) minus 1 star...[換行字元][換行字元]No need to say that no one from my family wanted to stay to see the end credits... But in the end of the day, every ones found that the movie and the way it ends was good but not that good!"
4767,First 30 minutes everyone is moping around couldn't hang around for another 2 & a half hours to see overpaid morons do senseless acts. I am ashamed to contribute towards this movie's box office record.[換行字元][換行字元]PS: I am not a dumb merican who likes stupid action without a story. Disney has ruined movies no one will make quality movies anymore just idiotic superhero stuff.
4768,"Upon viewing Avengers Endgame a second time I can now state that this is one of the best cinematic experience I have ever felt when watching a movie. It has many different elements of genre that work so well together be it action, drama, laughter and many others. To put all these aspects into a 3 hour movie without the movie being overly stretched is a marvel in itself but that is what The Russo Brothers along with the writers managed to achieve.[換行字元][換行字元]All the main Avengers characters have their time to shine and to the best effect possible. I will not mention any standouts because although there are main ones who truly shine this was much more really a team performance from all of them and I enjoyed each one of them in different ways. The visual effects of this movie are top notch that along with the score make the movie much better than it is.[換行字元][換行字元]To conclude, I must mention Kevin Feige and the team behind Marvel Studios (including Stan Lee and Jack Kirby) who created a set of movies (characters and stories) that entered the cultural phenomenon of the world that even for those, like myself included, who are not avid fans of comic books must appreciate what a remarkable job they have done with this movie being the culmination of them all. So very well done and thank you for the amazing experience that you have allowed to cherish all my life."
4769,I think no movie can beat this movie this is the best movie for me
4770,The movie was great but I expected something better but overall it was great
4771,Each an every scene is just amazing and perfect marvel studios u rock. Endgame is the endgame lots of love for all of u guy's
4772,Visual effects stunning again. Great acting. I was hoping for a better script.
4773,"This is the best movie I have watched till now. I will rate it 10 out of 10. There was so much excitement so much surprise so much action and the last thing which broke heart, emotion. Only the real fan will understand how much it broke heart. But it was needed to get 10 out of 10. As it is spoiler free I can't tell anything more but one thing, I have watched the movie in hall print then think how will it be in 1080p blue-ray. At Iast I wanna say the incredible last sentence ""I am Iron-man.""❤💝💝❤"
4774,"Pandering to the politics of the day created one shot during the epic battle of ALL of the female characters that this female found trite and patronizing. 2 or more other major plot decisions are also a betrayal of the fandom by surrendering to the tyranny of identity politics. Uneven and contradictory handling of the characters and plot decisions created a long list of plot holes and distractions .... compare Spiderman's friend and Ant Man's daughter. There are touching and heartfelt moments ... happy and sad tears shed. Sadly, those are diminished by the distractions of the plot issues. The 7 rating was a nod to the efforts of the players, despite the machinations of the script."
4775,"Has a mass-market blockbuster ever opened on such a downer as this one? Infinity War's ending made anything else impossible, of course, but what one expects from such a major movie is not an hour or so of a whole set of characters learning to live with loss and grief. It's to the movie's immense credit that this sustained so long, and so well handled, to the extent that the occasional flashes of Marvel humour in that segment of the film don't seem out of place. Occasionally we pan out to the big picture and global scale of the loss. One character saying ""I miss the Mets"" brings you up short; so many have died that, even 5 years later, professional sports can not function. Another powerful moment is a scene that takes in a monument bearing the names of some of The Vanished - the monument seems endless.[換行字元][換行字元]As well as this is handled, this wasn't my major concern ahead of the film. That revolved around what Endgame was going to do about the overwhelming loss of Infinity War. Science-fiction/fantasy stories run in to trouble, stretching credibility even in terms of their own worlds (which is the only credibility that really matters), when they get out of a narrative tight spot or emotional downbeat by pressing some kind of metaphorical 'reset button'; what happened didn't really happen, or is just undone. I feared even further when the proposed solution in Endgame started to be unpacked. In a manner of speaking, I was right to worry about this. A metaphorical reset button is pressed, but it's done in a deft way; the journey to that point is fraught with real loss that can't be undone, not to mention a bravura trip back through various points in some of the movies that have bought to this point, with scenes replayed from new angles (to say much more would be to risk too much of a spoiler). Both of these choices are well handled; as ever, this series mostly manages the dance between humour and sadness with great dexterity.[換行字元][換行字元]The major loss of the film was genuinely moving; other losses, less so. When you have a series of films that has (so far) lasted 11 years and 21 films, and introduced (according to Wikipedia) 226 characters, there's only so much attachment one can build up to many of them. Plus I'm old, and I forget things. This is especially so in one key plot strand that ends with 2 characters having to resolve which of them will sacrifice for the other. It's a powerful moment, but to be honest I just didn't care enough about them to really be moved by what could have been a landmark moment.[換行字元][換行字元]Much has been made in the last year or so of Marvel introducing its first film led by a black character (the excellent Black Panther) and a woman (the good but not outstanding Captain Marvel); these were indeed significant cultural moments. Endgame undercuts them somewhat by disappointingly sidelining them both for most of the film; admittedly, in the case of Captain Marvel at least, this may be as much to do with working out a reason for her immense powers not to be the solution to every problem. Even so, it doesn't really work for me; in the movie's defence in this regard, however, my 10-year old, previously superhero averse, daughter sat through it all without a toilet break or complain not once, but twice, because ""The girls kick butt!""; which is certainly true of some less central female characters.[換行字元][換行字元]Two performances stand out for me: Josh Brolin as Thanos is brilliant, managing to imbue such a cosmic villain with pathos. Paul Rudd (Ant Man) is, for me, one of the least appreciated parts of the MCU, and his performance is superb here; great comic moments, and an occasional cypher for the more casual viewer who needs to be caught up to events. In addition, any moment in which Taika Waititi gets to give voice to his flawless comic timing as the voice of Korg is a good one; more of that, please.[換行字元][換行字元]It's striking how little action there is for such a film; to be honest, this strained the running time for me. I think the middle third could have been contracted a little; it lagged at times. But I seem to be in a minority on that, as my daughter testifies above. For me it also suffers a little from 'Return Of The King' syndrome; there were several occasions when I thought it had finished (and wanted it to end), but another coda came along. Yes, there are a lot of character arcs to tie up; but it this is a film where neither the big picture nor micro narrative arcs are entirely smooth or neat, and the last 30 minutes or so dragged. What should have been a touching final scene for one character (and indeed the film) felt like blessed relief; other narrative developments earlier in the film were all but accompanied with a knowing nod to camera. The latter would at least have felt more in tune with the series' tone. The climactic battle isn't handled brilliantly either; there's too much going on with too many for me to really keep track of what's happening; a common fault of superhero films (Black Panther being one of the notable exceptions). I'm thinking that in this regard the makers could have learned from the flawless execution of the massed battles in the Lord of The Rings films.[換行字元][換行字元]These are small complaints in context. We do need to take a moment to acknowledge the Marvel achievement here; when the first Iron Man movie kicked this all off 11 years ago, none of us really knew what would happen. None of us expected what has transpired; a multi-stranded, complex, overlapping set of blockbusters that (largely) standalone for the causal viewer, bring in new fans with no loyalty to the comic books (like me) and serve the hardcore fans also. To reach this point of the project and to do so as one of the biggest films of all time, with the confidence to inflict real loss on its characters and audience, is a unique cinematic achievement which, for all the faults in this film or any others in the series, is something likely to never be equalled. If anyone ever says again that modern attention spans are too short and people don't really like complex stories any more, that conversation can be ended with the sample of the Marvel films (and Game of Thrones); all we need is characters we care about, and we remain capable of following even the most complex of plots. Remember these films are serious hits amongst people much younger than me, with a far greater grasp of the narrative complexities spread over all the films. In that respect little has changed since story-telling began.[換行字元][換行字元]There are themes and ideas to mine from this movies, and all that's gone before. Some of them will sit long in the mind, some of them give merely a fleeting suggestion. In all honesty, to really mine and understand those I'll need to revisit them all over a more condensed period of time; Endgame is certainly a film that you enjoy with a relatively limited engagement of the preceding films, but the experience will be all the richer in relation to the viewer's familiarity with the breadth of the context. For now, we come to an end that is also a rest, and a pause. We all need to take a breath."
4776,"This was a cool and fun film... but it did not meet expectations being that this was the grand finale we've all been waiting for... it had its epic moments and I laughed.. a lot.. but I just expected more.. especially after being blown away by Infinity War... this film was kinda a let down for me.. like most reviews already stated... they went a little to far with the humor. Some of the characters were just not the hero's we know and love... after all this waiting around for the biggest battle in MCU history.. it was short and not that exciting... I'm a huge Marvel fan... and as a fan.. for me at least... Marvels big finale was disappointing.... but, I gave it a 7 being that it was fun, seeing all the hero's on the big screen like that was great and it had its moments... but still a let down.. Thanks for reading."
4777,"Everything is great,you will like it very much ,especially if you are a marvel fan. It is must watch movie."
4778,"The best movie ,I would like to watch it again and again .I had really enjoyed every minute of this wonderful movie ,but we will miss IronMan"
4779,"Good movie, but ruined a great infinity war movie...timeline story lines work if it's simple and straightforward, but with something as involved as Avengers it was a hacky technique to resolve infinity war. Lame. The only reason it's a seven out of 10 is all the other movies that helped build characters."
4780,"It was ok, but not living up to all the hype. The fiirst movie was much better in my humble opinion."
4781,This is not a Marvel action movie. Watch only if you are a diehard Marvel stories fan. All the characters are looking tired and slow with no idea as to what they want to do. The movie lacks any serious special effects and is low on the high energy action that you expect from Marvel comics. The movie drags and the end does not end. No way anyone will see this movie a second time.
4782,"This film has it all, the classical marvel humour we all love, the suspense and surprise of events and what was going to happen, and sadness... a whole load of it. Even with sadness it was met with joy, positivity and a great send off to some of the team. 10 years of little special moments from a whole load of films all merged into one to create perfection. So many little Inside jokes, cameo's and the best story telling that really make 21 films seem like 1. Hands down the best 10 year story ever made. Thank you and farewell Avengers."
4783,This movie has done anything better like What Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2 did. A perfect movie that has a perfect ending.
4784,Makes me cry everytime i see it. Loved every second. I don't understand these other reviews saying they are dissapointed. To me it was perfect
4785,"This is a joke.. right? Were you all stoned or something? Put out the wrong movie? More than seventy percent of this belongs on the cutting room floor.. Correction, would make the cutting-room floor roll over in it's grave..[換行字元][換行字元]For most of the film we are subjected to a slurry of unconvincing self-pity and third-rate acting and direction so turgid and limp I wanted to spit at the screen in contempt.

It's not cogent.. it has no pace.. it doesn't flow, except in the way a sewer full of human waste does.. Sorry. Maybe I expected too much."
4786,Boring rehashed rubbish. Too long! Too many characters again!! Seen it all before and now I am bored of Marvel and DISNEY!!!!
4787,"After infinity war so much excitement was built for endgame and for good reason. Endgame gave us a great plot mixed with excitement, humour, action and sadness. Endgame was overall a great addition to a large franchise, that has produced so many interesting personalities and movies that have made a huge statement in the movie world."
4788,"I personally preferred infinity wars. This movies was so preditable and had so much feminist propaganda that it didn't feel natural at all. A balanced group of characters usually goes best. There was some funny moments to be fair and some few action scenes, but in general this movies just feels very commercial and does not manage to get my attention at any moment. The vilains were not great either!"
4789,This movie was so unbelievably great along with the amazing cast. It DEFINITELY DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!!
4790,"By the time I'm reviewing this, I've already booked a ticket for a second watch. I've may not watched the entire MCU films yet, but I've been following the series since IRON MAN 2, so I'm more or less a fanboy (and I'm eager to watch the other ones later). But, I will try to remain as unbiased as possible and not spoil the story. In the case of this movie, I've already prepared for what's going to happen... or so I thought?[換行字元][換行字元]Man oh man, where do I begin?[換行字元][換行字元]By this point, (almost) everyone has watched ""Infinity War"" and been anticipating the next big thing. The movie started with the heroes feeling scattered and somewhat hopeless. All kinds of emotions are stirring inside them as they are desperate to fix what's happening around them. One way or another, they found hope and a possibility to restore what has been lost and unjustly taken. But, it also comes with a price, and it ain't cheap.[換行字元][換行字元]That's the best way I could describe the film without going into spoiler territory. The other thing I would say about it is that it takes inspiration from other films and pay tribute to them in a way that feels fresh and exciting. Most importantly is how they put their whole heart on their sleeves. It's really hard to go through this movie without trying to hold back tears, and not laughing. It's also appropriate as it is the culmination of what came before in the MCU and astoundingly achieves a balance of emotional catharsis and genuine humor throughout.[換行字元][換行字元]I can't deny how uniformly strong the performances are, most notably Robert Downey Jr. Since he started in Iron Man, we've been seeing him grow as a character and it is a career-defining role. He almost stole the entire film with his tour de force acting. He really caught me by surprise by how nuanced and heartbreaking his story has been taking him through. I doubt the Oscars would consider a nomination for him for the second time, but it's still well-deserved. Other standouts are Chris Evans and Scarlet Johansson, even Chis Hemsworth. Captain America has been a really stoic character, but now he gets to flex his emotions a bit more and my lord, how satisfying it is. Black Widow wasn't given a lot of character arc before but now is put into the forefront, not only she radiates sadness through her eyes, but also desperation and longing which is rare to see in the MCU. Thor grew on me more and more since THOR:RAGNAROK, and he balances humor and drama with aplomb, especially in showing his emotions. Honorable mentions goes to Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Paul Rudd and Karen Gillan. I've never seen Hulk as this balanced and neutral character. Hawkeye has never been grittier. Ant-Man is always the comic relief but here also provides as a ray of light in the darkness with his wit and dry humor. Surprisingly, Nebula is the character I've never seemed to care about, only to shred her layers of toughness and see her sad vulnerability.[換行字元][換行字元]There's still so much to unpack and unload in this unbelievable 3-hour movie and yet, it doesn't feel like one. Granted, it does get a bit long and messy at times, but that's part of the story and it somewhat enhanced my involvement in it. Even great movies tend to drag sometimes, and this one has such a clear-cut vision so it's forgivable. Again, nothing's perfect.[換行字元][換行字元]Narratively speaking, it's as satisfying as a finale can be. Just when you think it would go this way, the movie goes to another. There's still so much surprises in store and I thought it sticks the landing. The overarching theme speaks volumes and struck a chord in me.[換行字元][換行字元]I cheered, I laughed and I (almost) cried.

4792,"I would say Endgame is in the top 5 of all the MCU. It's cgi was brilliant and at times the story was beautiful. There are three things that I feel endgame didn't do well. Thor. Although ragnarok worked with the action comedy, I feel they went to far in endgame. It feels like they where almost mocking the character and at every turn you had no choice but to laugh at him. Thanos. How can thanos without the stones be so strong? I understood in Infinity wars his power but even with the stones he got crippled but storm breaker but suddenly in Endgame he's even stronger with Thor seemingly unable to use storm breaker in the same way. I feel the whole time travel although great to look back at 10+ years that brought us to endgame, there was no structure, it all felt messy. I love the MCU and I still rate the film. For me as this is my opinion, had they got these things right it would have been the best MCU film ever. Like I said had some beautiful moments within the story and that helps pull you through the movie."
4793,What could be the best of overall in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Avengers Endgame gave us the best of all and it's worth it to watch. Thank you Iron Man for starting the path and it's a successful one.
4794,"I was a bit nervous about this movie, ""do I set my expectation high or low? Would it be surpassing Infinity War success?"" ABSOLUTELY with a 3000 CERTAINTY. It's well scripted, well made. I cried, I laughed, im nervous about what's gonna happen next, i can't what will happen next. I can feel their sorrow, hopelessness, but deep down, they still need that little push, well, they got one. I can't tell u much, because it's still opening week. Happy viewing."
4795,"Avengers: Endgame ends the 10-year story arc with a big bang. I'm still in shock by all that has happened. ENDGAME WAS UTTERLY ASTOUNDING. This movie is one of the best, if not the best, Marvel movies of all time. The initial reaction walking out of the theater was: ""That was crazy awesome, and I can't even begin to process what just happened.""

What an ending to go out with.[換行字元][換行字元]I remember seeing the first Avengers in theaters in 2012 and being starstruck by what I saw.

4803,"Believe it or not, I expected this storyline. That Thanos would destroy the stones and Avengers will move on until they find a way to travel back in time.

I will not go over all of them but I spent over an hour after the movie listing all the plot holes to my daughter.

But towards the end, Thanos uses one vial of Pym particle on his ship with everyone on board. With thousands of minion creatures on it. With no special ""Quantum"" suit or equipment. You mean to tell me Avengers could've just got on a vehicle and teleport all together with one vial? And with Hank Pym back now, they can time travel at will from now on.

But what it lacks in technicality and overall quality it more or less make it up with emotions, stakes and an abundance of fanservice.[換行字元][換行字元]The pacing is fairly inconsistent, storytelling botched and action sequences minimal. Rather the Russo brothers put emphasis on character development over plot, which were basically more or less presented in the last movie.

4810,I only can say it's not only the fighting scene that was epic even the plot story too great job russo's brother. i only disappointed because hulk get a little fight scene on the final battle.
4811,"Best movie I've seen so far. I doubted of thuis movie realiteit could be better than IW, nut iT certainly is. Great movie that I would recomment to everyone!"
4812,"The movie was easy to follow which is not true of all Avengers. It was very entertaining and it left me wanting more. In my opinion it's the best Avengers movie ever. However the movie is not without a flaw and what I'm about to say there's not a Viewpoint that the majority will agree. The flaw is the way they portray Hulk. The character is weak and a comic relief and that is not the Hulk that I grew up with. If there is one serious character that all superheroes are not so sure of and someone afraid of, it is the Hulk. This Avengers movie should have been about Park Redemption over Thanos. It could have been a showdown between two great champions,. It could have been a glimpse to show that the old Hulk is still there even though the more docile controllable and funny Hulk remains most of the time. That is the only knock I have on this movie."
4813,"This movie took my expectations and shattered them. I was stuck glued to the theater screen for all 3 hours not wanting to look away or blink. The perfect blend of humor, action, and emotionally powerful scenes. At first I was finding to tough to believe they would be able to surpass the events of Infinity War, but I knew the Russo Brothers and great team behind this movie were gonna be able to pull it off. And they did just that. The hour of the movie left me with tears of joy and tears of sadness at the time. By the time I was leaving the movie theater my eyes were and stingy due to the amount of tears I had cried. As someone who has been watching MCU movies since the very beginning and seen every single one this move was true worth the 10+ year wait. Could not be happier."
4814,I saw it and I love it so much!! It's a perfect end of a perfect saga

4819,Just got home with my family after watching this in a packed cinema. Was a joy to watch with so many others and hear the shrieks of laughter and sobs of tears. Just goes to show what a huge part these characters have played in our lives in the last 10 years or so. What a fitting conclusion to this epic franchise.
4820,"Its an epic concluding movie to all the MARVEL movies released before. Its an perfect mixture of humor , suspense, emotion & full of Surprises."
4821,"I haven't nt seen all the Marvel movies, but I've seen some - the Iron mans, the Ant mans, Cpt Marvel. I enjoyed them. I thought I'd go and see what the fuss was about. However this, is so formulaic, ridicilous and boring I couldn't take it for the whole film. I walked out after 2 hours, and it felt every bit as long as that. If you're not a huge Marvel fan already, you may well not like this film, because I feel it's somewhat self-indulgent. It's like an effort to squeeze a bit more money out of fans."
4822,It was the greatest idea ever to end all the movies in these 10 years into one great epic conclusion.Amazing work from all the people involved across these 10 years.For all of you I would like to say Thank You Very Much.

4830,"I don't have to give away any spoilers to say this movie was terrible. I was so excited to see this movie. First, I have watched every superhero movie that lead to the creation of this movie. Please don't believe the critic reviews or other obviously paid for reviews. This movie was horribly boring, with very limited action. I enjoy comicbook and fantasy movies, but I also enjoy a good drama. The issue isn't that I couldn't appreciate the emotional aspect of the movie, it's simply that it was done very poorly. There were so many issues with the plot, and characters, but worst of all is a tremendous amount of pointless, long sections of uninteresting dialog. On top of this, the very few action scenes that were in the movie were really poorly done. For the most part, they were a blurry, choppy mess, and you couldn't appreciate what was happening enough to make it effective and cool. If you like movies that are boring, and try to play on your heart strings in a really contrived way, instead of being entertaining, then this is the perfect movie for you."

The many, many different characters are utterly dwarfed by the film's enormous scope.

But there are so many players and so many backstories to tie together, that you could be forgiven for feeling more relief than a visceral thrill when it's all said and done.[換行字元][換行字元]On the plus side, there is a stirring musical score and a heartfelt ending that will put all doubts about the film's soulfulness to rest.

Yet that shouldn't detract from how skillfully the writers and directors manage to balance so many elements and fuse so many genres to deliver a unique piece of pop-entertainment that is full of humor, spectacle, and drama.[換行字元][換行字元]The Avengers is not a particularly profound franchise. It doesn't attempt to be allegorical like The Lord of The Rings, it isn't as mind-expanding as The Matrix, it isn't as mystical as the original Star Wars, nor does it make any social commentary like The Dark Knight, but it has plenty of great archetypal characters who embody different aspects and struggles with heroism. Each character plays so well off the other and the cast has so much chemistry.[換行字元][換行字元]No other franchise understands its characters better than Marvel, and no writers have a better grasp of heroic conflict and camaraderie than Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.

A Masterpiece doesn't have to be perfect, and most aren't. Certain elements of the plot feel rushed and loopholes are glossed over. Not all the jokes land, but most are pretty funny.

There are any combination of nitpicky observations I could make about parts that don't exactly make sense, but those are minor.[換行字元][換行字元]Admittedly, I do have a bit of Marvel fatigue after this.

Marvel movies are popular because we have been told by everyone we have to love them. If you have one bad thing to say about a Marvel movie, you will become more isolated than Tom Hanks in Castaway. Well worth a watch but please...pump the brakes."
4845,"Reading through some of the low mark reviews from what one can only presume are DC fans I can assure the hand full of people whom are yet to see this movie that this is without any doubt a masterpiece in modern movie making. I've read comments on how the first third of the film is 'too slow' but this is totally necessary due the need to portray the weight of devastation caused by the snap from the end of the Infinity War instalment, as a stand alone movie it's quite the spectacle however to truly appreciate it I would recommend seeing all the previous MCU movies from the past 10 years chronological to truly benefit from all the call backs. Go see it, buy it, marvel at it and maybe DC can learn a thing or two from it."
4846,"A lot of useless speech this time. The movie would have ben better if it was two hours long. Thor, please, Thor...."
4847,"Expect everything from this movie, because that*s what it's trying to be. It wants to be fan service. It wants to be an epic finale. It wants to be a beginning and stepping stone for the remaining heroes.[換行字元][換行字元]It ends up being a collection of references and borderline fan fiction with a short 15 minute break for the kind of movie that you should expect from this franchise.[換行字元][換行字元]Unfortunately you will be just exausted at that point by what retroactively seems like a bunch of ""Last week on Avengers"" clips. It's not even terrible, even though it's obvious filler material, it's often funny or heartwarming, but you see the minutes and hours walk by and it just. doesn't. go. anywhere. Up until the aforementioned 15 minutes, and those are painful since they remind you of the movie that you could have and should have seen up until this point.[換行字元][換行字元]Followed by yet another 30 minutes of an ongoing funeral where the brand is literally and figuratively burries itself.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers managed to overstay their welcome, but I will still remember them fondly.

4848,"What a waste of a film. The first hour was totallly wasted. Yes there were good bits in it, but a stupid story with a boring script couldn't save this."
4849,"Delightful feast for true marvel followers! Took care of micro-nano things, I watched it in cinema, entire cinema went berserk, have never seen such kind of wooting, was on edge of my seat for almost half of movie."
4850,"There are no spoilers needed to back up the statement that 'Endgame' is the Swiss cheese of the bunch as far as plot holes and internal contradictions are concerned. Emotionally strong and visually impressive, it's one of the most entertaining movies in the MCU and cannot be missed by anyone who watched most of the others.[換行字元][換行字元]But unless you are already deeply invested in the MCU or simply have to know ""what's next"" after the (actually far better) 'Inifity War', or you're just here for the fights, tear jerks and explosions, this movie is entirely missable.

It's a shame that a movie that does such a good job of connecting everything, making it look so good, with so much star power, ends up being a plot mess and honestly lazy."
4851,This is by far my favorite movie ever every one NEEDS to go watch it in the theater there is so much action at times andyou will not be able to get everything on a normal screen ... It's not comparable to any thing else.. I laughed i cried and even after over 24 hours . I smiled when the battles happened i loved it all for a 3 hour movie you don't feel it.. I'm going to leave it here because i don't want to go spoilery
4852,"Quite possibly the worst Avengers film in the series. Plot holes in every single scene, bland and cold acting. Sad really!"
4853,Among few best you get to watch in a years .Avengers endgame is one of them.
4854,"Avengers Endgame is a perfect farewell packed with emotions and grandeur, Must watch for Marvel Fans..."
4855,"I give it 3 stars for the huge effort, special effects and good acting. Overall it is a stupid film, bloated with self-importance and sentimentality, with poor pacing. Action scenes did not quite land with me, you know, superheroes throwing and punching stuff, who cares."
4856,"There is nothing to say about this movie other than that it is utterly perfect. I was completely speechless after seeing it. It is this generation's Empire Strikes back, only light years better! Marvel couldn't have ended this 11 year saga any better than this. This epic masterpiece is truly perfect. 10/10."
4857,11 years of MARVELlous entertainment from The cave IRONMAN to inevitable THANOS. Its End Game stunned with excellent shots and wow moments. Russo and Lee love you guys.
4858,Not worth the IMAX or Dolby. The music score was the worst of all the Marvel movies and double bad music for the end credits. Just a mish mash with no transitions. Go see it to finish out the series but not worth the price for IMAX or Dolby.
4859,"It is hard to end a story especially with as many characters as the MCU so I came in expecting a weaker movie than Infinity War. The story ends appropriately for the main characters and they do have some satisfying character moments. The major battle scene was too hard to follow since there were too many characters in an environment that is already visually busy.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall a good conclusion to the story.[換行字元][換行字元]Could it have been better? Yes, but the same can be said about most other movies."
4860,"Not the Avengers Stan Lee created. Emasculates the heroes, and attempted to sell a new hero. The character Stan Lee created is completely destroyed. Even the abilities are messed up. This is not Avengers."
4861,I don't know what to say. Was it a movie or some kind of joke? Terrible screenplay and ridiculous performances by some ridiculous actors (of course they are not actors).[換行字元][換行字元]Hey Russo brothers... You SUCK.

Infinity war was definitely better - I was on my seat the whole time; this movie, not so much.[換行字元][換行字元]I've heard a lot of people say that this movie was heart-wrenching and tear-jerking...maybe we just have different preferences because I felt like this movie didn't properly set that mood at all.

Too many weird things that could have been left out. Too many things that frustrated me to the point that I was just throwing my hands in the air while simultaneously questioning why some characters didn't choose to do things differently. I was eye rolling a lot near the end. Too many individuals deserved more screen time than they received, and some were given too much of it. Some individuals just became downright annoying to me, some left me surprisingly delighted.[換行字元][換行字元]I dunno, I liked it but it definitely had the potential to be much better.

4864,The movie is unlike its precursors unamusing and dull.
4865,The perfect closer for the perfect cinematic universe
4866,"The best marvel movie ever, I cannot put into words how amazing this movie was, too good!"
4867,"This movie was a very strange experience for me. It wasn't bad but also was not good either. There are constant attempts at humor that feel forced and unnatural (most of Rocket's dialogue feels that way). The whole movie felt like it was saying good-bye instead of building the story. The action scenes were pretty bad. Sure, lots of special effects and great CGI but again, there was nothing supporting any of that. It's the worst Avengers movie and while it might have generated some box office revenue, the story and dialogue are completely forgettable."
4868,"Another fun movie to watch 4/10 for sure (imdb makes us compare this movie to godfather) I just don't see any difference between this nice popcorn movie and others like ninja turtles, transformers and GI joe! fun to watch but plz don't give it an oscar!!!!"
4869,"Russo brothers did an outstanding job. Every moment of the movie was great. Some scenes that are connected to first Iron man movie, previous Avengers movies and comics were so neat that it just makes you say ""WOW!!!"". Battle scenes are breathtaking. Ending is just perfect. Enjoy the movie and make sure to watch it couple more times."
4870,"Incredible movie, jaw dropping. Entire theater was in tears."
4871,"A good coverup of marvels fault of building a big lovable thanos. The fight sequence was like ""the screen is full of faces "" . Simply made to end the series."
4872,What to say about this film good points its an avengers movie bad points it was not what you would expect from an avengers movie was complete rubbish from start to finish
4873,"And my what a finale it is! Easily the best MCU movie out there and while you probably need to be a fan and watched all the previous 21 movies in the series to appreciate and understand everything, it will still be a good movie to the casual viewers. Filled with big moments from start to end, watching the characters break down, reunite, grow, and finally say goodbye is an emotional rollercoaster, that will move anyone. To a fan who has seen all the movies in the series these emotions will naturally be 10-fold stronger. You may think you're ready for this, but you're not."
4874,"It builds from a haunting melancholy tune to a thundering, iron-willed anthem for everything that's great about MCU and comic books in general. Twists, turns, surprises, tears, smiles and memories.. as close to a perfect conclusion to ""Infinity War"" one could hope!"
4875,"The Avengers: Endgame...a true comic book masterpiece! You can't get any better than this, a perfect finale to The Avengers series."

4877,Extremely well done. Wraps up all the character arcs with a bow on top. Numerous character crossovers from every MCU film. Similar to the series finale of Star trek the next generation in some ways.
4878,1st hour and a half in I was ready for it toend so long and dragged out the last 30-45 mins made for good watching but that's it
4879,"The movie is like a volcano, waiting for the fire to arrive and you feel bored, but the end definitely changes your mind"
4880,What a masterpiece that russo brothers made you should definitely go and watch and after this movie i was like damn man we are not kids anymore
4881,"Three hours . Blimey, what a long film. Dull too ..same old same old. Thor was cool - the rest were not. My 12 year old loved it though - so I guess that's the key. But god it's a long haul. and too noisy to sleep."
4882,Very powerful and full filling movie. Best superheroes movie ever
4883,I grew up watching the MCU. What an ending to a fantastic era. This is a once in a lifetime movie. I loved it all.
4884,"It ain't perfect, no movie is, but Avengers Endgame is hitting on all cylinders from start to finish.

The whole movie is perfection and every tiny bit is important and you must not miss every single one. Don't do toilet breaks. If you want to enjoy this movie in a big crowd, watch all the MCU movies for easter eggs because there's A LOT of it here, I swear. You will love every character and appreciate their development during the past years. Everyone shined, no one was left out. The script is perfect: fun, emotional and exciting. And definitely, DEFINITELY, don't miss the third freaking act. For me, it's the best third act in all third acts of superhero movies. All in all, it's a perfect culmination for a movie that is 10 years in the making. It's worth it. And I would definitely re-watch this movie."
4886,What An Awesome Movie I Really Enjoyed It One Of The Best Movies of The Year
4887,"In my top 3 favorite all time Marvel movies! Some may have not liked the slow build up, but I meld together really well."
4888,"Man i was sooo exicted over this movie, but it wasn't what i expected at all. I wish i would've liked this more than i did, i want to love this movie so bad but i just can't. Im givin it an 8 just because i love MCU and i liked the battle in the 3rd act."
4889,This film is incredible and emotional on so many levels. It was worth the wait
4890,"No spoilers. I have watched every movie in the MCU and Avengers:Endgame is such a great movie to top off all these characters fighting for Earth and the universe. The Russo's have made a solid story, merged so many tales and lives and brought these characters from the pages of a comic book into breathing, feeling life. Thank you for such a great culmination of so many twists and turns."
4891,"I thought Endgame was a good movie. Not awesome, or amazing or anything else. Just good. I liked it but didn't love it. And I thought it was a little too over hyped and overrated. In my opinion, it is not the best Super hero Marvel movie ever. It starts off a bit slow. Not a whole lot of action in the first half of the movie. It does have some funny moments and when the action kicks in, it is great but about the same as I've seen in other Marvel movies. There are some surprises but I didn't cry 5 or 6 times like some have claimed they did. The biggest surprise is the ending which is a shocker and a tearjerker. I did cry at the end as I'm sure everyone else did and will. No spoilers. I can't help but think that if Endgame was a DC movie, I don't think Marvel fans would have given it such rave reviews. Although I have seen some Marvel fans review it too, and they didn't like it as much either. At the viewing I attended, I could tell it had mixed reactions. There was some applause at the end but others, like me, just seemed a little disappointed. Well, everyone has their own opinion. You will either love it or not. Regardless, Endgame is still the movie of the year and will be the top box office gross for a long time."
4892,"It felt like I say goodbye to my friends who have a long journey together. It felt like I watched a comedy , action , sci-fi , drama , all of this genre in one movie . I started to laugh then I started to cry and I started to think about all of the story of mcu. Every second of this movie is so worthy. There's no time to go to toilet !"
4893,"Can't really tell without spoiling the whole plot. They really showed how connected the MCU movies are, it will make you laugh it will make amazed it would give you goose bumps and it would make you cry and can't really talk about the last 30 mins of adrenaline rush which was what we had been waiting to see in a comic book superhero movie"
4894,"Well, I've just seen this movie and although I am far from a fanboy of this genre I've seen enough of MCU films to comment that this one is far from the best. I really don't know where the 10 ratings are coming from, perhaps because people have seen the 21 previous films and have invested time in those and HAVE to like this one. I'm just glad it's all it's all over. There's better films out this year to look forward to. If you're a massive fan you'll give it 10, if you're not it's a meh."
4895,IVE JUST WATCHED ENGAME THE BIGGEST EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER IVE EVER BEEN IN IM JUST SPEECHLESS
4896,"Movie overall is okej. But for being an 3 hours movie i expected alot more! Slow first hour, messy story telling and they really destroyed couple of characters with jokes and pure boring stuff. It felt like 10 different people wanted to get their story/scen idea in the movie. I have been marvel fan all my life, but this movie was far the most disappointed one i have seen and they really ruined couple of characters for me. You should see it, still okej movie but not more."
4897,Marvel did it again. This film is a tribute to the hardcore fans of the franchise. We have got an ending we deserve.
4898,A movie that has everything a marvel fan can want or expect the movie is wonderfull in terms of everything you will laugh you will wonder you will cry and in the end you will be amazed.

4900,"THAT is how a movie should be made. Explains a lot with addition to more. Humor, drama, action, Sci-Fi, excellent CGI as always, even thrilling at times. Overall a perfect movie for what it is."
4901,"Even though there are still many obnoxious details that bother me a lot like; people refusing to kill one another just so they can say one more glorious line, the whole time traveling thing that makes the entire story meaningless or the overly predictable character realizations of giving up hope but then suddenly changing their minds; I have to admit it was entertaining. What I also have to admit is that its not easy to make a 3-hour-action-movie not feel like a 3-hour-action-movie with correctly balanced audio-visual dynamics.[換行字元][換行字元]Remaining Avengers have to travel in time and try to fix what they couldn't prevent in the past."
4902,"It made me laugh, made me emotional, made me sad. Overall, it is a great movie. And the best from MCU. As a MCU fan, I'd suggest you to watch the whole movie till the end. Cause it got alot of twists. After-all Avengers : Endgame. Whatever it takes!"
4903,The amazing end of the journey.... From beginning to end the plot was really really good.. loved it
4904,Outstanding final installment! Sad to see it end but the ending couldn't have been better. I would see this again!
4905,"Avengers: Endgame is better than I ever could have imagined!!! A love letter to the past decade with so many Easter eggs, just an absolute joyride. The last half hour is a spectacularly jaw-dropping, emotional, goosebumps-filled piece of cinema unlike anything we've seen thus far!! (A forever Christmas gift for my 10-yr old self)[換行字元][換行字元]Marvel closed this out by pitching a perfect game!! Just ... wow. This 22-film story arc has been an amazing ride! Thank you, Marvel and everyone involved with the making of these films! #ThankyouAvengers"
4906,Awesome. so much to see. everyone got their moment. well done to all involved.
4907,"Emotional, funny, excoting, creativity. It left me speechless after the screening, Marvel did it again by creating a piece of film that no one could've done except the Russos. People always said real man doesn't cry, but not us....I left the cinema with tears amount my eyes and sitting there just to process what've done through. 10/10 the best Marvel movie so far after I do Infinity Watlr"
4908,"This one was actually Amazing! I was intrigued the whole time, not looking away from the screen once!! The audience got a kick out of it too, gasping, laughing, and even cheering! By far my favorite Avengers movie!!!"
4909,"There probably will be nothing that tops Avengers Endgame at the movie theaters ever again. All signs indicate the movie theater industry is dying. Very few films can open well anymore. I realized after watching Triple Frontier on Netflix at home that honestly, there really is no need to go to a movie theater anymore. My 4K TV that is 55 inches cost $250 at Best Buy. That is the entry level for big screen watching at home now. Buy a projector and you can watch on an even bigger screen for a bit more effort and expense although with roll-up TVs and short-throw projectors getting more popular, entertainment in a box will soon be a very real possibility. And that's not even mentioning cellphones, laptops and tablets.[換行字元][換行字元]So as for Endgame, sad to say, instead of this Avengers being split into two to tell one cohesive story, unfortunately, the Russos took a more pretentious route and decided to tell two stories instead. It becomes clear after an incredibly dull, and I'm not exaggerating here, hour and a half, the movie finally picks up and gets more interesting. It may take a while for the fanboys to admit it, but this was a really, really subpar movie. I mean, it felt like the Russos made Infinity War as a complete movie, only to have Disney hack off the last thirty minutes to finish it off and tell the Russos they have four hours to write Endgame to make as a separate movie. These guys are definitely talented directors, no doubt, but this was a really, really bad movie motivated by profit-making. It showed. The plot holes are YUGE.[換行字元][換行字元]I kind of liked where the story went when this movie picked up around the halfway point. The problem is, it could easily have been done in the last movie. If they could make a cut condensing both movies into one and cut out the BS, it would be incredible. I will probably never watch Endgame again, just being honest. It's a bad movie. The beginning almost invalidates everything that happened in Infinity. It just should not have happened, period. It makes Thanos look stupid.[換行字元][換行字元]And oh yeah Marvel, any reasonably intelligent person can see the end was an out for the stunts pulled in the movie. It was the screenwriter's equivalent of a blank check. In one other pivotal scene, the answer to the dilemma was literally staring the characters in the face but they were too dumb to realize it. Never trust comic books or the movies. Logan pulled a similar stunt too; if you watched the first Wolverine movie, you'd spot the trick they pulled easily too.[換行字元][換行字元]I couldn't honestly recommend seeing this in theaters. Trust me on this. It felt almost like a cheesy half-baked expansion pack of a videogame."
4910,"Blockbuster movies are made to entertain people and we mustn't expect logic, I fully agree with that. I had great fun watching MI: Fallout and Alita Battle Angel this year but Endgame turns out to be like every other superhero movie that came out this decade. The opening scene features Jeremy Renner losing his family after Thanos' actions in the last film, after that scene to till the end the movie just bombards us with video game like action sequences and unfunny jokes.[換行字元][換行字元]The plot of the movie is much better most superhero films to its credit but the dialogue and screenplay was no different. While I don't want to spoil the plot, this film has bought back all characters associated with the MCU and is a reunion delight for many hardcore fans. The final battle sequence is my least favorite part of the film, it features random action sequences and right from the very start you would know how its gonna end. If you are expecting it to be like the ones you saw in The Lord of The Rings or Harry potter you are gonna end up disappointed.[換行字元][換行字元]If this is Robert Downey Jr.'s last film as Iron Man as per reports its a great news for all movie buffs, a talented actor like him has wasted his last 5 years acting only in MCU franchise movies which didn't fully utilize his potential. Finally, this movie is going to be the biggest blockbuster of the year without any doubt but its only the beginning of end of the superhero genre."
4911,"If i had to give out spoiler about ENDGAME, i only have 3 words to describe it , Blood, Sweet and Tears! *eh This movie really deserves the hype, all of the attention it got in these past 3 months. So unpredictable, exceeds our expectations. A supremely epic ENDGAME to a decade of MCU's infinity saga. Without doubt, i'll give my 10 of 10 to it 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽"
4912,One off the greatest films to ever be made the cast and crew of the movie should be proud of this as a fan of marvel this is one of the greatest superhero movies to ever be made its full of humer Heart/heartbreak a true masterpiece in cinema if you haven't seen this movie then your missing out on one of the greatest movies of all time 5 stars and a 9.7/10 go see it now its marvelous
4913,"Alot of things could have been done better. The whole film is based on a time-travel idea that Antman came up with and Antman doesn't get enough credit or time in the film. Hawkeye gets more time in the film! Who cares about Hawkeye?! Slow in parts. Reminds me of Avengers Assemble, most of the film is build up to a final, end of film battle. Much preferred Infinity Wars pace, energy and action-packedness. Infinity War made me so excited for Endgame. Endgame made me want to rewatch Infinity War."
4914,"To all the haters, sit and think about the sheer amount of story, fan service, fun, epicness and sadness that tge managed to pack into 3 hours. The Russo bros had to tie up 22 movies and that is impossible, yet they pretty much pulled it off, anyone who says the price of admission wasn't worth it just for the Captain America scenes alone may as well stop watching movies. This is a tough act to follow, and a far more worthy record holder than the blue alien pocahontas rip off ever was. Keep it up Marvel, we are eagerly waiting for the next 10 years of amazing stories."
4915,"This movie was honestly one of the best marvel movies I have ever seen. Anyone who has seen every other movie from the MCU must watch it. It is an amazing movie filled with comedy, tragedy, action and more. But if you were expecting more of captain marvel, she doesn't get that much screen time the movie. But other than that, this movie is amazing and I recommend anyone to watch it."
4916,"With my expectations in the clouds, I watched a movie in the stars. It completely satisfied every role a film could have, while also lovingly interacting with the franchise's history. As any marvel film, it was complete with jokes. However, they seamlessly intertwined with a deep emotion that runs throughout. With no review being complete without criticism, I did think that though Captain Marvel plays a pivotal part, her character does not have the flesh of 3 dimensions.[換行字元][換行字元]It is an incredible cinematic experience.[換行字元][換行字元]Quite simply, it's the best."
4917,This is the greatest movie I' ever watched!! Amazing work!!🔥🔥👌🏻🎞🙏🏻
4918,"WoW , I am speechless if you have not seen this film go see it because this movie is a Marvel fans dream . The movie starts great , grabs your attention and keeps that attention until the credits role . The Russo brothers did an excellent job making this movie only for one group of people the Marvel fans and they will find it the most enjoyable . AMAZING FILM"

4929,Specially like scarlett johansson acting in this endgame. Can feel her sadness and helpness.
4930,"Character depth, emotion, action, more than apt sequel for MCU movies. The war sequence climax is the one you should expect the most."
4931,"Infinity war is way way way better than end game.i didn't like the story that much. expected much more, i am not satisfied."
4932,From the first moment of the movie till the end... The whole 3 HR you will feel like Woooow... Not boring at all especially the last hour.. Just perfect ending for that epic movie very emotional... I'm going to watch it again... Be careful there will be no time going to the rest room if you want to better to do before the movie... Enjoy...
4933,"What a buildup for 11 years. First in 2012 when we were teased with Thanos and now, the final battle. Everything I could want in a Marvel movie with many memorable moments and incredible scenes. Avengers: Endgame is this generation's Star Wars and hopefully, more is to come from Marvel Studios."

4945,"With universal critical and moviegoer acclaim, as well as an army of fans celebrating in unison, accompanied by the small accolade of utterly demolishing the worldwide opening weekend record with its $1,200,000,000 in receipts, literally doubling the record set by its predecessor, Infinity War, it would seem that even a cursory glance to an outsider would evince this film's status as an undisputed masterpiece.[換行字元][換行字元]What is special about this movie is something I've seen curious little attention about. See, with 11 years of careful guidance and incredible investment by Disney, culminating in a veritable universe like no other, that at this point seems to eclipse even the likes of Star Wars, Rings, and Thrones in terms of scope, possibility, and world-building, it still really could have been marred by an unsatisfying conclusion.[換行字元][換行字元]In an age of derivation and dwindling originality, it could have been all too tempting for the Russo brothers to have opted for the artistic approach of defying expectations a-la Rian Johnson, and essentially fumbling the attempt at goal.[換行字元][換行字元]Life is short, so when a fanbase has loyally invested over a decade of their lives across 21 movies, there was so much pressure on to provide not just a satisfying conclusion, not just another excellent movie, but something truly spectacular.[換行字元][換行字元]So, how did the Russos fare? How did they take Disney's monstrous $400 million budget, the expectations of millions of devoted fans awaiting with bated breath, the dozens of stars cast, the 50+ characters, and the delicate task of working with fabled comic book material guarded by legions of acolytes, and work with it?[換行字元][換行字元]They created a movie that will forever stand the test of time, setting the bar so far beyond reach of the chasing pack, it is doubtful it will ever be attempted to be beaten again.[換行字元][換行字元]One could even argue that Endgame is not just the conclusion to the first three phases of Marvel's cinematic universe, but to the very concept of comic book movies building towards a giant story arc and spanning movie upon movie.[換行字元][換行字元]After all, how else can you top an ending battle whose proportions make even its own predecessors seem small scale?[換行字元][換行字元]How else do you top a main villain so nefarious in his goals that the stakes are literally universal?

4946,"Though it has been repeated time and time again, it is still quite insane to think about an end to 11 years and 22 movies. A cinematic universe that for quite a few of us, we have grown up with. A universe that despite all the bad that may have gone on in one's life or in the world, we could always look forward to one day out of the year where we could escape that and enjoy 2 hours of watching our childhood heroes kick butt on the silver screen. A cinematic universe, that I quite frankly thought was impossible to successfully conclude, until the Russo Brothers proved me wrong. Any way you slice it, Avengers Endgame should go down as one of the toughest movies to write. Bringing a true and satisfying ending to 11 years of stories in a universe where the death is never truly accepted, the cast size seems never-ending, and an overabundance of story arcs could drive any writer insane should prove a near impossible task. Yet here we are as smart, conscious decisions are made throughout the movie. The reduced team size allows for a focus both character and story wise that makes it a movie easy to follow (for the most part) despite still being among the most ambitious Marvel movies. Surprise callbacks and fan-service moments act like a Greatest Hits album giving fans a true appreciation for the greatness of the Infinity Saga. Despite the temptation to just rely on these callbacks, where the film truly shines like any other Marvel movie is with its characters. Through the course of the 4,5, and 6 movies the Original Six Avengers have appeared in, several decisions have been made that not only affected each character but changed their overall perspectives. The Russo Brothers dedication to these characters is seen in the masterfully crafted scenes that continue or conclude the appropriate arcs. All while still producing shots, scenes, and moments that created the best cinematic experience I have ever had. To put it simply, for 3 hours I simply got to be a 10-year-old cheering, laughing, and crying with the heroes that I have grown up with, idolized, and loved for my whole life. For that I thank the entire Marvel family!"
4947,"This movie is epic, ties everything up nicely and provides us with a sense of wonder and joy. If you loved these movies than you will love this one. It provides all we need to enjoy a movie. There are one or two things that don't make sense to me, but with closer analysis might make sense."
4948,"This has to be one of the most overrated films I've ever seen, it was long boring and tiring to watch. The story was boring slow and at times just felt unnecessary. I genuinely don't understand how people can say it was a 10/10 film."
4949,"I guess the headline wraps it up - what I feel about the movie, that is. With three hours and a rather good prequel it was expected to see some epic action and showdown between the good and evil characters, but yet we only get some minor action scenes and a heck of a lot of boring dialogues and stuff like that. Where is Superman when you need him? At least that would have made the movie more exciting for me. No, the movie has some moments, but it takes too long to get there, and when we do we only get a tiny bit of the action I was hoping for. Thus, with a rating of 8.8 and a throng og positive reviews I must say the movie was disappointingly bad, though not as bad as I first thought it would be after the first two hours though. If you like long dialogues and conversations between superheroes and fancy waiting for action through an entire movie then surely this is for you. If you're like me and liked Thor 3 best since it had a lot of action, then this will be better to watch on Netflix or something when you're out of options."
4950,"Even if you didn't like the previous title ""Infinity War"" as much as it is represented by the audience's rating, I can totally recommend this emotion-packed, thrilling and surprising movie to you. I won't really talk much about the plot itself, don't worry. But I'll try to tell you what this movie delivered some other movie of this franchise didn't.[換行字元][換行字元]First of all, character development. Equally valued character development! This movie gave finally the 'It' factor for those characters who before Endgame didn't live up to their full potential and at the same time most of our beloved main characters reached something we've never seen before.[換行字元][換行字元]Second, pacing and mood. Especially in Infinity War the humor felt forced to me, we had quick jumps between unnatural emotions and I couldn't even relate to many favorite characters. This time emotions get their time. Humor is still there, but naturally when it is needed. It neither felt too short, nor too long. Disclaimer: This doesn't mean this movie only appeals to those who didn't like Infinity War that much, but this movie appeals to nearly every taste - as long as you watched most of the previous movies.[換行字元][換行字元]And one of the biggest plus points - relevance. I already respect the great approach in Infinity War of binding everything in the Avengers-related universe to the major movie. But Endgame surpassed this game in unexpected ways. This movie makes you question since when everything was planned besides the comic-related events.[換行字元][換行字元]And surprisingly the last point is the marvel universe' physics. If you followed some Marvel movies lately, science depth is something which worked pretty good in some movies, while in other movies the answer for superficial thoughts was ""evolution"" or other excuses to not think about it. Believe it or not, but this movie really trashes this confusion and explains the physics in their universe that mostly makes sense.[換行字元][換行字元]Yes, this movie might not be a master-piece. We might have some usual monotone background scores again with some time too draggy dialogues, but the huge potential Infinity War left at its end is definitely reaching many types of audiences. It surpassed the given potential and passes even more potential to the future Marvel movies.[換行字元][換行字元]PS: Don't let spoilers suggest you to not watch the movie. You'll still love the experience of how it lead up to that particular spoiler event!"
4951,A thriller story following the continuation of infinity war . We a introduced to a new avenger who just might be the strongest yet.This is the end game
4952,"I didn't want this to end but this film is the perfect send off! Does not feel like you are watching a 3 hour film, draws you in from the beginning to the end"
4953,Just amazing movie.. Best marvel movie till date..
4954,Easily the best franchise in history. Taking 22 different chapters of one amazing story and cramming it into one concise ending. This movie could have lasted 5 or 6 hours easily and Anthony and Joe Russo managed to squeeze it down into 3 hours. Amazing.
4955,"There is no one on the planet who will be able to guess what happens, how the characters start out and develop through the film or what they all do. Not a single fault with this film!"
4956,"Three words to describe the methodology inherent in destroying a franchise - or any story for that matter. For all the intrigue, conjecture, speculation, and cosmic potential Endgame enjoyed long before its release - and might have included - they opted for the least fascinating and pedestrian of stories: when it all else fails, just go back in time and change it! I do not mind heavy CGI movies with no substance; they're entertaining from a technical perspective, and when a decent story props it up, at least there exists some satisfaction. That said, with Infinity War, there was great possibility. I'm not going to bother with a detailed review here ... this movie was wrong ... all those richly detailed characters, all those amazing back stories, all that simmering creativity, all that ingenuity and inspiration totally and utterly wasted. I gave it 4 Stars just because it's nice to end the misery, but it is difficult to appreciation the wastefulness. Sad really."
4957,Most satisfying ending ever. My childhood is complete.
4958,"Best movie ever, dont go watch it alone bc you'll need a shoulder to cry on xoxo -gossip girl"
4959,Thank you marvel Thank you marvel Thank you marvel Thank you marvel Thank you marvel Thank you marvel Thank you marvel Thank you marvel Thank you marvel Thank you marvel Thank you marvel Thank you marvel Thank you marvel
4960,"3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies. I will watch it again and again and again. 10 points well deserved!!!"
4961,"This is the end game with 22 movie conmected with people and took the people and fans to the world ,universe of marvel....i conratulates the whole MCU for this wonderful movies and fantasies given to the people..i love the every movie that came from marvel..."
4962,"Every second of this movie is amazing. Many moments where you want to cheer. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry. Blessed to be alive."
4963,"This is the most amazing, emotional and most sensational movie of all time"
4964,"I'm not usually one for getting teary-eyed over fictional characters. The only times I have were for Dobby, Logan, and Liliana in the War of the Spark trailer. So I expected to get a slight gut punch from the movie, given the stakes. But what I got was a whirlwind of humor, nostalgia, and pure sadness. Whatever the naysayers may tell you, this movie is wholly worth the ticket price."
4965,End of the game... Movie is over. No more end games.
4966,"I absolutely loved this movie; enough to see it twice. In my opinion, this was the best one out of all Avengers, and they really did it justice. I cried several times from being happy or sad, and laughed hard throughout the entire film. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it yet."
4967,"Worth every tear drop spilled, this is a fitting end to the 22 movie saga. What an accomplishment"
4968,"What a year to live when End Game hit theaters all over the world. This movie made for fans from fans itself. I love how story develop from 1 point to another point. Not going to talk about plot hole or they could do that instead doing this who the hell care bout that. This movie very entertaining from start to finish. This is 2008 ~ 2019 build into awesomeness. Every bit character in the movie got their moment to shine even for a bit minutes. I love what they have done with the franchise. The RUSSOS You guys are ROCK, I saw what u guys already planned for next movie. Really enjoy for this , Just go watch and enjoy the action, the character and the audience clapping when something AWESOME happen. Happy Marvel days , should get public holiday after this movie. Up to next Spiderman : Far From Home ^^"
4969,It is the best movie ever . Nothing can beat it . Those who are giving negative review just GO. TO. HELLLL. #avengersassemble
4970,"This film is not deep or complex by any means, no MCU movie is. But that's not why people go to these movies. They go for fun entertaining characters and great action, and in that area this film succeeds. If your a long time fan of the MCU this movie will be a satisfying end to the 11 year saga."
4971,Glad I only wasted $4 watching this awful movie. 3 hrs I never get back . I really liked Guardian of the galaxy and infinity war . But this is just trash .
4972,First half of the movie had big pacing issues it felt really weird to watch but the last half was the best 1 hour of cinema I've ever watched. There were a lot of plot holes that I enjoyed but they also fixed some form previous movies. I enjoyed all the reference and thought fat Thor was alright but I wish they did more with Korg. Movie was funny at parts and dark at others which made more a good all round movie.
4973,"This movie hit all the notes, was well acted, entertaining, emotional and wrapped everything up nicely. Yea the time travel aspect is hokey but ITS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE PEOPLE! Don't believe the hate, do believe the hype and go see this movie!"
4974,"An awesome film which caps off the last 10 years, leaving plenty of questions and plenty of different ways the MCU could go, it is going to be interesting to see how the next 10 years go in MCU!"
4975,Just go and watch this once in lifetime film.11 years of story telling come to a grand finale. You will not be disappointed. Except few super hero fans.you will not get happy ending always. Bet you. This movie will make you go crazy. Repeated audience is inevitable .
4976,"I'll give it 6 stars out of 10, the fact that they congregate all the Marvel families in one story is cool. BUT the whole thing is very predictable, with awkward jokes, basic cinematography/editing... epic music is everywhere, trying to save the plain plot, but with low expectations on Marvel Comics I'm not disappointed."
4977,Last salute to end the saga in a very amazing way possible. But the movie could've been short. And a few Characters needed more screentime.
4978,"It made laugh it made me cry it made excited. This movie is a true love letter to the fans.They promised and they delivered. This is 11 years in the making, and i have to say it worth the wait ! GO WATCH IT ! ITS EPIC!!"
4979,Movie was awesome! The characters played exceptionally well and the ending was unexpected
4980,"I am very disoppointed ,actualy i know ,at the end if infinity war ,they gonna make it mess with ant man and time travel ,hardlu you see other charcters ,the way they make hulk off realy mess"
4981,Prepare to be blown away. This film is the perfect conclusion to the first generation of Marvel movies. Your expectations will be topped.
4982,"Satisfying. Heartbreaking. Funny. Perfect. The best ""finale"" in the history of finales. You can actually feel your favorite characters coming full circle, redeeming themselves, pushing boundaries, and some even finally accepting and becoming the best version of who they are after a millennium of trying to be who they're supposed to be. Excellent callbacks, the one liners are brilliant. Great cameos. You'll laugh through your tears, you'll get chills.[換行字元][換行字元]Even if someone spoiled the big parts for you, you won't see it coming, not actually. This is an experience of a lifetime."
4983,"The long-awaited Avengers: Endgame was near perfect. It includes amazing performances, a great story, breathtaking effects, hilarious comedy, jaw dropping moments, and quite frankly, the BEST final battle in the history of the MCU!!! Even during the ""slow"" parts, the film is entertaining and easy to follow. Highly recommend this film to everyone!"
4984,"Avengers: Endgame is more than a movie. In its three hours of projection, what is seen is a parade of superheroes and visual effects, true homage to the legion of fans who, since 2008, as in a great TV series, have been following the saga.[換行字元][換行字元]Who is a follower of the Marvel Comic Universe on film screens, knows that after half of humanity and most heroes have been ""wiped out"" by Titan Thanos, bets on a possible rematch between the survivors and the possessor of the powerful Inifinity Stones was a matter of time.[換行字元][換行字元]The remaining Avengers (Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Combat Machine, Rocket and Nebula), still without knowing the whereabouts of the Hawkeye, make a trip, with Captain Marvel, to the planet where the Titan is, where fight an unsuccessful battle for the recovery of the cosmic gems.[換行字元][換行字元]Five years later, Ant-Man returns from his journey to the Quantum Realm, which began before the Thanos' crushing ""snap"", and finds a world totally devastated, with abandoned ships and cars, empty streets, and a memorial named after thousands of dead, including his.

4985,"Watched this film after work, after food and right at the end of the week. Was scared I'd fall asleep as it was 3 hours long. It felt like less than an hour! Amazing film, loved it!!!"
4986,"Assemble for Marvel's latest triumph encompassing a vivid story, grand style, striking visuals and overwhelming heart.[換行字元][換行字元]It is unbelievably difficult to give a full-blown rating without spoiling anything, but all I will say is it has surpassed my expectations. I can't recall the last time I felt this way about a film since perhaps the Lord of the Rings or the Dark Knight films. And after 11 long years, the Infinity Saga is now complete.[換行字元][換行字元]This is where an era ends, and begins anew with what appears to be a brilliant future. The only concern I have is just how high each new MCU film will have to jump after a this film has set the bar so high. A fitting end to an enduring saga.[換行字元][換行字元]Stan would be proud."
4987,"After 21 other pretty great and fun movies, these last two Avengers movies are such a let down . After Infinity I did fest that time travel would be introduced, which is so lame and irritating. Very disappointing!"
4988,Just got out of the theatre. Awesome movie! Weaves up the threads into a big fat huge ending. Plenty surprises in there. A huge amount of beyond entertaining scenes. And the scale of it is EPIC. Oh my God of thunder. Pay offs and priceless moments.
4989,"Perhaps some fans expecting a colossal/great war between thanos against the remaining avengers. But what endgame provide is simply an unlogical storytelling. First, they really dont know how to put captain marvel in the story. Second, there should be 2 gamora after hulk use the stones. Third, is that really hard to beat thanos while in the beginning the rest of the avengers easily chop thanos' head. Fourth, captain marvel make it too difficult to hold thanos' fingers for flicking? All of those issues are not sensibly accepted. The plot is too shallow, and they try to force the story to be realistic which absolutely uninteresting and rubbish."
4990,"I think it's best final for this amazing story. I don't know how to create something better. So emotional, so fantastic. It was action, comedian, dramatic and amazing movie at simultaneously. I laughed, cried, impressed."
4991,"My friend, who I'd taken for the movie, fell asleep during the show. Seriously.[換行字元][換行字元]The first hour or so of the movie will do that to you. Unless you are a fanatic fan of The Avengers. Maybe even then. I am and I was checking messages on my phone almost throughout.[換行字元][換行字元]Sad."
4992,Just plain amazing. Can't be described in words.jokes come at the right time
4993,"First review from me. This film deserves it. A superhero film, marvel or not, does not have the right to send me on the emotional rollercoaster that End Game did. It has no right to do what it did, paying tribute to 10 years of films whilst changing the rules as to what a superhero film should be.[換行字元][換行字元]I laughed, lots. I cried, lots. I cheered (quietly and internally of course), lots I even punched the air in a ""go on!"" during one scene[換行字元][換行字元]I can honestly say, no film has ever moved me like that. Hours later, my heart was still pounding, the adrenaline still flowing from this epic piece of film making.[換行字元][換行字元]Made by fans, for fans. Are there flaws? Yes.

Well done Russo brothers. Well done![換行字元][換行字元]Fans! Assemble!"
4994,Overall the film had a very satisfying end to a decade long story.
4995,"The only reason I have this terrible movie a 1, is because I can't give it a zero. I don't know what I was thinking watching this, but it was awful, just a waste."
4996,I'm a lifelong Marvel nerd. I live and breathe Marvel; with that said I'll start my review. The story picks up immediately after Infinity War with Thanos decimating 50% of all life as they try and rectify it. The cast was good though I honestly felt it lacking in conviction besides Tony Stark. The action was lackluster as heck. Endgame is 30 minutes longer then Infinity War and had maybe a fourth of the action runtime that its predecessor had prior. Disappointing battles minus one which lasted all of but a few minutes. The comedy was Endgames only saving salvation to be honest. It pains me to write this because Infinity War was the best superhero movie since sliced bread for a culmination movie. Average at best for me. They should have stopped after Infinity War though I know the comics wouldn't have it. I personally thought it was a cash grab. I'd say watch it once absolutely but don't believe the hype. Endgame makes Age of Ultron look good AF.
4997,"Where to begin. Endgame needed to do A LOT in terms of ""landing"" characters, and drawing conclusions. After all, this movie is leaving you with impressions that for many of the characters, will be the final one (I'm not calling out deaths here, simply that we don't at this point know if Marvel will make more movies including a lot of the characters here). The stakes have perhaps never been higher for any movie ever made. Do they succeed? Oh yes. Yes they do.[換行字元][換行字元]One of the reasons, I believe, is because the actual plot of the movie is genuinly plain and simple: Can we reverse what Thanos did, and also kill him? While this is by no means an easy task, the simplicity of it allows for the movie to work towards a finale with a 2 hour build-up, that largely centers around quick, well thought out and highly rewarding ""dives"" into our beloved heroes and their own personal stories, while they try to ""solve the problem"". And this was a REALLY smart strategic move from the writers/directors, I think. This type of character-first type of approach, makes it easy to bring in a lot of references, which to anyone who's even just seen half of all previous Marvel movies, should result in a permanent mini-grin from beginning to end in fan-service galore. No matter who your favorite hero is, chanced are you'll be very pleased.[換行字元][換行字元]In all fairness, the movie is a bit slow in the beginning. At least I can imagine it is for those that don't appreciate all the references as much as I do. But man does it pick up. I don't know who you are or what you have seen before from Marvel, but as said, the plot and the ""mission"" is simple enough - and the real actual endgame of Endgame will not disappoint you in terms of action, humor, or heartcrunching twists and turns. I laughed, and I cried, all while at the edge of my seat.[換行字元][換行字元]I'd say there's no question about whether you should watch it or not. If only to witness a movie never before created, that wraps up 21 others - go watch it. But besides just telling you this, I do want my review to be ""helpful"" (even though people will anways click those buttons below based on whether they ""agree"".) But in order to try and be helpful: If you have seen all or most of the movies leading up this and wonder if you should rewatch something before watching Endgame, then I suggest Spiderman Homecoming and Guardians. Maybe even Guardians 2. I won't say they are in any way important to understand any major plot points, but there are references and relationships from these movies that might give Engame a stronger emotional grip on you if you have them fresh in memory. With THAT said, you'll get tidsbits from possibly every single movie from the Infinity saga, so nothing will be wrong in term of warm-up-movies. Those are just my personal recommendations :)[換行字元][換行字元]Have fun!"
4998,"Love3000 <3 i love this movie because im crying, smiling and depressing...."
4999,"It has taken many years and lots of work to build up to this amazing movie. This completely satisfied and exceeded my expectations for how I hoped they would pull this all off. I have been a huge fan of the movies leading up to this and this did it all justice. All the hidden ""Easter eggs"" from the other installments have been hinting towards this and I can't believe how big this has all gotten over the years. I was glad to see that even though this movie had a very serious fight at hand that there was still some classic Marvel comedy that made for some very funny moments. There was laughter, tears, and cheers through this movie. It was an emotional roller coaster that I already plan on going to again soon in theaters. It is a must see for those who have already been fans of the MCU and if you haven't followed it to this point this movie won't make sense or mean much to you so go back and watch the other movies. It is all worth it."
5000,"I've already seen it twice and still feel I could watch it again and be surprised by its grandiosity. The cast is absolutely unbelievable, they are all there, together. The action is breathtaking, it basically never ceases. And the drama... I had never cried so much in a cinema before. The emotional rollercoaster of a lifetime!"
5001,"Another MCU all time blockbuster!!![換行字元][換行字元]Just want to say if you miss this one, you will surely miss your way to HEAVEN. This is the ultimate heaven! Go and watch incredible journey of Robert Downey Jr & his team's performance."
5002,"If you've been invested in the past 11 years of the MCU's stories, this movie will, at the very least, be incredibly fun. It wraps up several characters' plots in what might be the most epic film we get in a while."
5003,This movie is great and very entertaining to watch I might go see it again in theaters
5004,"This movie is a Marvel fan's dream. It has action, humor, and so much heart. No spoilers here, but bring lots and lots of tissues. The pacing was good, and I felt captivated the whole time. This movie is crazy good."
5005,A great end to a great adventure! The film provokes a range of emotions including the odd tear.
5006,Hands off to the last of MCU movies. This whole storyline was a masterpiece. I am going to see these movies again and again and again I will never stop. Thank you Marvel
5007,This movie did everything right .it just checks all the boxes .
5008,"Watched crying and over and over![換行字元][換行字元]This is one of the best movies in the m marvel universe, I will never forget this movie."
5009,"Imma be honest: I was afraid this movie would be boring, overly sentimental and poorly written, but luckily IT IS NONE OF THOSE THINGS!! They managed to fill the surprisingly long run-time without boring the audience, and the plot managed to round up the character's stories very well. I was happy when I left the theatre even though the movie obviously had some sad parts. Before seeing it, I was worried I had hyped myself too much and would be disappointed, but instead I am glad that it ended in such a perfect way. Anyone who claims otherwise should be burned alive."
5010,Simply well done Everything you could want and more
5011,"Avengers:Endgame ,a movies hyped for over 2 years finally came to the cinemas and the audience after leaving the show were just left numb. This movie is a perfect conclusion to a 21 film long story-telling and though it was a difficult task for the team,Russo brothers just pulled it off with style.Leaving no ends loose,this movie made us experience every human emotion.It made us laugh,sad,made us cheer ,feel for the characters and finally weep for them.No doubt this is one of the best superhero movies in the past decade."
5012,"Watched last evening on Blu-Ray and was quite disappointed. Should have streamed it for a lot less. What in the world is going on with the writers and producers these days. Plot was weak at best. Time Paradox was poorly done. Character development bordered on the ridiculous. Thor was made into a bumbling drunk idiot, Hulk was....I don't know, some kind of a cross between Banner/Hulk working in a diner, and was nearly useless like in Infinity Wars, Captain American now has and can wields Thors' hammer. What in the world is going on! This unfortunate change started surface with Infinity Wars. They also made sure all the politically correct stuff was jammed right in there. The first two remain the best, don't even bother with the others. Sad!!"
5013,"Sry, but this isn't a 8,7 rating movie. I get that it's all doom and gloom with what happened in the last movie, but u don't drag that out for 2 hours. Main acts becomes sideshows, story is a mess. Put in a bit of woke and u release it. I will not rewatch this."
5014,"What a boring, predictable excuse for a movie. I'm so glad I resisted the hype and didn't suffer through this in the theaters. It's obvious this movies reviews are artificially inflated on this site, just look at all the other negative reviews."
5015,"Endgame is an amazing culmination of 11 years of Marvel movies, leading to an epic battle. The acting, CGI, and plot are on point. It was also great to have references from previous movies, showing that all of the MCU is connected.[換行字元][換行字元]I fully recommend, but do watch the previous movies to understand context, characters, and the story in general."
5016,"Going into the movie with high hopes, came out astonished, kudos to the people making this movie a wonderful thing!"
5017,An emotional roller coaster from start to finish. You can't find a better ending to the Avengers saga.[換行字元][換行字元]DON'T MISS IT
5018,By the time Avengers: Endgame (2019) still fresh in my mind I can say that this movie is one of the best well spend 3 hours in my life and the best conclusion to the first chapter in the MCU history. I can't wait to see how they outdo all of this in the next 10 years
5019,Absolutely amazing! Go and see it. The most complete Marvel film EVER
5020,This time I m speech less best movie of the year and so emotional comedy and some out of action this is snap of fingers
5021,"The avengers go out with a bang in this movie. It's fun, it's emotional, it's action packed, it has surprises, it does the ending of the avengers movies justice. It starts out slower but it's all worth it for the end. It had moments where people cried, clapped and gasped. Go see it!"
5022,"Who is the young guy shown just before Maria Hill and Nick fury, in the avengers montage following after they flow the ashes of Tony Stark into the lake?"
5023,I think this movie is even better than infinity war! It feels balanced (as all things should be!) and you really feel a connection with the characters. It also has a lot of humour.
5024,"Unreal. Great story, affects and comedy. Storytelling done well"
5025,"After 10 plus years of watching these film, I'd never thought I'd be so happy watching the end, but this movie was only greatness and deserves everything"
5026,When I saw Endgame and Carol came on screen with her new haircut the gay in me actually moaned in the theater so loud my mom sitting next to me had to tell me to call down
5027,By far this is the best movie that I've ever seen in cinema. Grab a popcorn and enjoy the perfection of 23 movies of MCU
5028,"Just 'marvel'ous. Blockbuster movie making at its zenith. The first movie that has properly lived up to its gargantuan hype.If u thought the pervious entry was the pinnacle, this one will put it to shame. All thanks to the Russo brothers and the wonderful actors who have lived their characters. If u miss this movie, don't visit the cinema hall again."
5029,"By no stretch of the imagination does this movie deserve a spot next to Dark Knight, Godfather, Lord of the Rings, Inception, Shawshank Redemption or any where within the top 100 movies. It was alright. Not revelatory. The best thing that happened in the movie was the heroic sacrifice. That was awesome. They captured the emotion perfectly, it was sad, but appropriate. This had some feel-good moments with massive collaboration from most of the entire universe. Also, this movie could possibly have elevated to an 8 if they put Deadpool in...that would have been awesome and hilarious. It was not overly thought-provoking. It was just a little above the average popcorn Marvel movie-nothing truly profound, just fun verbal quips and too much fighting and too many missions that somehow ends alright (not amazingly though)."

5031,This is the very best marvel studios has to offer you should go and buy the DVD or the blu-ray every moment is worth enjoying
5032,"Amazing acting performance for all the characters. Realist CGI, fulfilling and not disappointing ending. Well played Marvel!"
5033,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT HAS SUCH A GREAT DEVELOPMENT FROM THEM BEING HOPELESS TO HAVE HOPE AGAIN,ILL AFFIRM THIS AGAIN BEST MARVEL MOVIE"
5034,"This is called the best END of MCU movie. <3<3 Don't go for the cam print, go watch it on cinema and experience the best movie in history of MCU."
5035,"I cried so many time, also smile during crying. I feel like going cazy. Thank you for all over 10 years."
5036,"It was hard going, same old Marvel machine churning out predictable plot. Would rather of re-watched Game of Thrones S8E3 again that of wasted my time and money on this."
5037,Brilliant Superb . Unreal Electric Emotional[換行字元][換行字元]The movie had it all
5038,I gave it 6/10 just to decrease the rating ...so it cant be better than the dark knight rises...as it is totally fictional ...and so fictional movies shouldnt be in top 10
5039,The best ending for the best movie series of all time
5040,"I think the director didn't want to get a dizzy about time machine. It made some questions about the plot, for example: -When the ending war was happened? Years? Why past thanos can find the present avenger? -How can Capt America getting older?"
5041,"There are lots of good things in the movie but its just doesn't live up to the hype being created. The directors must have felt the need to bring 10 years worth of stories and timelines to a closure. But in their pursuit to do that, they have deadened the pace. The first half felt a little stretched and there just wasn't enough time left for the actions sequences & heroics we all love so much in the second half.[換行字元][換行字元]All the actors did a fabulous job, especially RDJ, Chris H and Chris E. Rest of the characters just didn't get much time to shine. Overall, this was a decent watch for all Marvel fans. Just don't head to the theater with too high hopes!"
5042,"( No Spoilers)Truly the best marvel movie out there! For marvel fans and non marvel fans. Hits you hard. Everyone cheered more than any marvel premiere I've been too. Visuals were outstanding, acting was superb, and story kept you so involved that a 3 hour long movie wasn't long enough. By the time credits rolled and tears were still being wiped away everyone wanted more! Go see this! You will not be disappointed!!!!!"
5043,"This is my first review after seeing many biased review towards endgame in internet.I knew many people will love infinity war over Endgame.At first I also thought like that.But please watch both movie as a whole infinity saga.please make a note,this movie is not like iron man series or thor series or captain America series .IW and Endgame are part 1 and part 2 of infinity saga . Endgame starts just after IW so please make sure to see it as Single movie.i know u will love it . U will appreciate what a Masterpiece Russo brother have created. Direction, humour , action and story telling are just spot on.And also many people will get confused over the time travel stuff.So please watch explanation video available in YouTube.[換行字元][換行字元]At first I wanted to rate endgame as 8/10..but once I did my research and watched IW again..I was just completely blowen away thinking about What MARVEL have created[換行字元][換行字元]So after so many analysis I would rate endgame as 10/10.[換行字元][換行字元]Only part i was sad...seeing what they did to Hulk.But that's fine."
5044,There's There will be blood and more recently Leave No Trace. And then there's this crap. Acting that makes my eyes hurt and a story so bad I just want to stop watching (which I did). It's movies like this that makes me lose faith in the art of film making. And the rating 8.7 just makes me wanna stop talking to people. What a waste of money...
5045,Wow! Wow! What a fantastic ending to the infinity saga! And what a payoff to marvel fans...just awesome!
5046,Whatever I say is a little bit the movie is a failure the worst that Marvel has ever taken.
5047,"Looks like the Avengers aren't the only ones who did ""whatever it takes"" to deliver movie magic. Bravo to all the cast and just WOW!!! Marvel fans everywhere have been on a rollercoaster ride for 11 years and Endgame is a perfect celebration of the MCU!"
5048,Speechless. I am gonna cry for days. I love you 3000
5049,"Unbelievable. For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many. I don't want to spoil anything. Watch it!"
5050,"All I can say is, if you haves loved the MCU over the past decade, this movie will be everything you need it to be as a fan. Perfectly executed. The attention to detail by the Russo brothers is evident and beautiful. Never thought I'd say that as a 40 year old mom of 4. MCU is more than a bunch of comic book characters, they have developed these characters over the years so that by the time Endgame happened, as a fan, you are invested in who these heroes are as people and not just their incredible superhero abilities. My advice: fans, avoid spoilers! And for those reviewing, good or bad, keep the details of the movie to yourself. The film will be more meaningful to the fans if they get to experience it oblivious to how it all goes down. Can't wait to go back and see it again. Prediction: biggest movie of all time!!"
5051,"I am a big marvel fan. When I saw infinity war's ending I was immediately excited for this movie. This was easily my most anticIpated movie of the year and probable of all time. When tickets went on sale I got some for the midnight premiere immdiately. And somehow dispite my high expections this movie destroyed them and created a even better movie then I could have imagined.[換行字元][換行字元]I loved every second of this movie. Even the first act were most people have complaints I loved. The second act is better then the first but man that final act is just masterpiece. Every cast member from beginning to end is amazing with Robert Downey Jr and Chris Even's being standouts. And thats not easy since I think everyone gave their best performance here and are all able to draw emotions from you. Now some directions charectors take will be not suite everyone. In fact how the avengers deal with the events of infinity war isn't gonna go well for everyone. But I for one loved it. Lead to a few cheer moments. But if you wanna talk about cheer moments man that final act. No spoilers but I wanted cheer at many moments. Two moments I nearly jumped out of my set. But while it's mostly laughs and smiles when this movies wants you to feel man it'll make you feel. If you've been a long time fan (you've probable already seen it but anyway) you will choke up I know I did and I feel no shame admitting it.[換行字元][換行字元]If you want max enjoyment out of this film. Watch the rest of the movies. I know it sounds demanding but it's worth it. Cause you'll understand meaning behind stuff. I saw it with my dad and the two moments I nearly jumped out of my seat over he was thinking ""Ah ok"" so yes do watch the other movies if you haven't before you see this one.[換行字元][換行字元]In the end Avengers: Endgame is in my opinion is one of my favourite movies of all time and the best marvel movie to date and I dought that will change. I know I didn't say much about the movie but I'm trying to be spoiler-free and the trailers show like nothing of the movie and thats what I based my can I talk about this ot not kinda mind set. But I can't describe how satisfied I was. This truely was an end of an era and I all I can say is I am so glad to be apart of it. To follow these charectors and become connected to them and then to finally see the conculsion thia masterpiece of a story was more then worth the wait."
5052,I Didnt see this but this is best movie in the world because its Marvel.
5053,Following all the hype about this film went along with great expectations - Film had good characters and storyline but failed to live up to my expectations - Great film for the children but not a 10/10 film
5054,This is so lame to tell anything but go and see it while it's on theaters. Culmination point of so many movies and I'm sure nothing will be as amazing as this is.
5055,"Although throughout the movie you kinda expect what is happening, Avengers Endgame closes out the 10+ years of MCU greatly and opens up nicely new ways for future MCU films to come, it's definitely an unforgettable experience and a must watch for every MCU Fans, Non-MCU Fans might feel lost in this one. 10/10 for MCU Fans. 7/10 for Non-MCU Fans."
5056,Nothing to say more than that this movie will always be the greatest of all time.
5057,"Really disappointed after watching it yesterday. Unnecessarily long, very boring finish to a series of movies with a lot of peaks (Ragnarock, GotG, CaptA) and quite a few troughs (AoU, Iron Man generally, Black Panther) but I thought this was a new low. Really poor writing, idiotic plot holes and stupid action scenes. Really sad end.. felt like flogging a dead horse, shame to go out like this."
5058,"Finally it's here. But not the finale we deserve. The story is quite thin, the action is scarce and the 3+ hours is too much. The humor saves the movie. Without humor it would have been a total disaster. This should have been the finale that would be epic. Looks like they where going for the quick money instead of waiting to perfect it. Sad to see it end like this."
5059,Truly a breathtaking end to a saga that is so dear to all of us[換行字元][換行字元]With an ending that shakes my world You will not be disappointed with this conclusion[換行字元][換行字元]This is truly one of the best marvel has ever made
5060,"If you are a marvel fan: you will watch it anyway, STOP LOOKING FOR SPOILERS And if you aren't a marvel fan: go watch every marvel movie ever right now. Stop reading. GO!!!"
5061,"The worst movie in the world. the movie goes from being a superhero movie to a comic. Full of errors, ridicule and absurd situations. Horrible!"
5062,"What's missing from ""Endgame"" is the free play of imagination, the liberation of speculation, the meandering paths and loose ends that start in logic and lead to wonder."
5063,The best avenger movie and the perfect ending to the story
5064,"Before I start, are you a fan of Marvel? Have you watched all 21 MCU films before?[換行字元][換行字元]This film is the best work ever made by Marvel Studios and is one of the best superhero films. They impose the characters in their all films with various characteristics and uniqueness very neatly and meticulously in order to be able to relate to their audience.

5066,Best Marvel movie! Excellent from beginning to end.
5067,"Just ordinary, nothing special from this movie with almost 3 hours duration"
5068,"All the emotional sustenance a movie should provide are here with action, drama, suspense, comedy and the culmination of a decade of movies. The movies serve as piecemeal backdrops which certainly service the title's narrative in ways that does not require exposition. The pacing is logical and although it subverts some expectations it builds a crescendo that only lets up when you've passed all possible heights for how a conflict of this scale can unfold. The crux of the matters around which the character's motivations were constructed is resolved by sheer brilliance - not because of complexity but rather simplicity: a clean, honest rendering of the character's inner drives being used to full effect. The narrative is convoluted in appearance only. While initially the characters attempt to make sense of things, even the most astute quickly come to terms with how limited their understanding is. The drive to do what must be done overtakes everyone in a fever the Mad Titan was all too familiar with in Infinity War. Those seeking to unfurl the logic of events are misguided by considering causality as a factor. The story's events are as unforgivably non-linear as the quantum realm through which the Ant Man ventured through on previous occasions. Those seeking to damn the studio for portraying their favourite character as less than desirable forget that *character development* does not always equal ""betterment"" but it does gain sympathy as our equal. In their lowest point, giving what little you can is still sacrifice and bravery. Those who dislike the matters of representation need not be overly sensitive as it does not yield ground to character substance and worth. Those who seek a puzzle waiting to be resolved are inevitably disappointed. Those who appreciate rhythm and are invested in the story so far will be rewarded[換行字元][換行字元]If reading all the above was tiresome, you've earned your rest."

5070,This type of movie are come in a decade so dont miss your favourite heros journey and a most powerful villian of MCU (Thanos)
5071,Growing up with the Marvel universe may sway my opinion a bit but this is one of my favorite movies. It balances all of the characters extremely well and never gives too much screen time to one character. The plot is just the right amount of complicated and just the right amount of funny. Avengers Endgame is perfectly balanced.
5072,Please watch..... best film I have watched in my life
5073,"Met expectations in many ways. Fitting end to a well thought out universe that is the first of its kind.[換行字元][換行字元]Hidden agendas felt a bit forced into the movie... Captain Marvel needs to be revised. These stories work because of balance and symmetry. Without it, why not just create a character with no emotions, no relevant story, no personality, and no weaknesses that can just be the answer to all problems...oh wait you did. Luckily, Marvel had enough stock built up in the first 95% of their universe to make up for the 5% of force feeding they decided to inject at the last minute...stick to the comic books, or create your own characters and make a separate universe. Not nerf existing characters while boosting new characters to fit your agenda."

I couldn't wait to see the follow up after the unbearable cliff hanger we were left with.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers:End Game had none of these qualities. It felt like 2.5 hours of sentimental drivel and a 20 minute battle scene.

I was looking at my watch 2 hours in to see how long I had left before I could leave.[換行字元][換行字元]The only exciting part was the battle scene and that was poorly designed and predictable.

5075,"This is the first and foremost english movie which i've/we've watched the opening show in the morning at 5am. As it marks the end of the decade long marvel collection of movies, we were very much thrilled to watch the movie asap, but still we got tickets only on the next day. It was definitely one of the fascinating experience as the movie was filled with so many things like time travel, actions, emotions, suspense, it is definitely the most anticipated movie as everybody knows but the fact that it still manages to entertain is where the movie makers excel, hats off to pull off such a massive thing. But making my favourite Iron Man disappear in the end was unexpected and long lasting. In tamil Vijay Sethupathis' voice was just set into our sub conscious very well so it didn't set too much to the movie from the point of view of general audience like us."
5076,"Disney knew it was going to make a ton of money from this sequel and so it feels like everyone involved in its production, from directors, writers and actors etc. just didn't bother turning up - aside from collecting their pay cheque. Anyone with a reasonable amount of intelligence and maturity will know the movie undelivered massively. Perhaps trying to weave characters in and out of previous movies took their eye off the quality of the offering. For those who have rated it a 10, once their excitement from all the anticipation dwindles, reality will sobering. Shame all the previous quality, especially infinity, has this movie associated. I should've known something was amiss when cpt marvel turned out to ba a total waste of time. MCU Phase 4...? You can shove that up your....!"
5077,"First of all let me say that I was looking forward eagerly to this movie along with millions of others, I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and there's no doubt you get your money's worth. For the broader fantasy/adventure genre that superhero films fit into, my high-water mark is set by the Lord of the Rings trilogy. On a scale where LOTR is 10/10, I give Wonder Woman a 9, and both Avengers Endgame and Infinity War an 8. In other words, it's darn good, and it has the high satisfaction level that the Russo brothers promised us we'd get. The production values are state of the art, and the payoff is to see *almost* every MCU character present and accounted for so that we can see them in action once more.[換行字元][換行字元]I was surprised -- if you'll forgive the circular statement here -- by just how many surprises there were for both the plot elements and the characters themselves. It's now clear why the producers and directors kept such tight wraps on this thing before its release. Broadly speaking I was expecting that this would play out in much the same style as Infinity War, like they were the first and second halves of a 5.5-hour epic. I was wrong. It's epic all right, but stylistically, Endgame is its own film. The biggest thing I didn't see coming is that lots of the first half particularly is reflective, deliberately paced, and NOT just slam-bang CGI. As far as I'm concerned that was welcome -- the cast is populated by characters we've learned to care about so give them space to breath. It's the end of an era and it's all given a proper sendoff. At the same time, there are plenty of big, dramatic entrances that led to cheers and applause for the audience I was in. Those are glorious, and the final big action scene is over-the-top huge. The flip side, though, is that there are SO many characters in play that most of them get only a bit of screen time, not much more than cameos.[換行字元][換行字元]One thing that was not a surprise was that most of the Endgame storyline followed the Original Six Avengers -- Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Hulk, Hawkeye for one final go-round. Mostly, it's the Three Amigos that head the list. And by the end I felt like those characters have all had lots of innings by now, it's past time to move on with all the other characters we've met and who could be just as engaging. The main ""other"" leads here with bigger-than-cameo roles were Ant-Man, Rhodey, and Captain Marvel, all welcome.[換行字元][換行字元]I think the whole 22-movie arc of the MCU, and in particular Infinity War and Endgame, might qualify for being the movie event of a generation -- i.e. something so big and involving that everyone knows about it. A generation ago, it was the Lord of the Rings trilogy. A generation before that, it was 2001: A Space Odyssey and also Star Wars, two films that laid out diametrically opposite paths for the space/sci-fi genre and have both had their successors. And a generation before that? According to my parents it was Gone With The Wind, the making of which was nothing less than a national experience on a level bigger even than we're seeing now. (Just for fun, look up how movies rank in the all-time box office list after adjustment for inflation. Avengers Endgame has a ways to go yet.)[換行字元][換行字元]About that 3-hour runtime. Too short for the material! Add another half-hour, put in an intermission, and then we'd have a true epic movie. Way back when, that's what big-budget epics were like -- things like Ben-Hur, Spartacus, How The West Was Won, El Cid, Cleopatra. They were great! Not just movies, but whole experiences. The intermission gave the audience a chance to do a washroom break, maybe get some more popcorn, clear their heads, then settle back in again. Endgame is *almost* there.[換行字元][換行字元]Some other thoughts:[換行字元][換行字元]Yes the big battlefield scene(s) toward the end make up a great orgy for the fans, but so much of it makes no sense. Various of the most powerful Avengers go one-on-one against Thanos and then get interrupted. Where's Iron Man when Carol is fighting him? Where's Wanda when Thor is going at him? They're supposed to be working together. This was too obviously just a way of giving everyone their chance at a big scene. This feels like lazy storytelling.[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]Yes! Captain Marvel is right in there and boy is she powerful, but her presence felt just a bit tacked-on -- more like a guest star. I know this was supposed to be all about the ""core"" Avengers, and it is, but I wish they'd worked harder to bring her right in to the center of the story. (Great CGI too that no other MCU character has.)[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]But this movie underscores yet again that the MCU still has a gender problem. Nebula is underused (again). Wanda is underused (again). Mantis is underused (again). Carol is uber-powerful but underused. Black Widow has been treated horribly inconsistently all the way along in the MCU films, and the way she's portrayed here is yet another example. She deserved better.[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]I didn't much like the way Thor was used here either. They've pushed him so far into comedy mode that he's become a clown. Bad choice! Chris Hemsworth does light comedy well, but he's equally good as the serious God of Thunder and I wanted more of that side. The first Thor movie is one of the half-dozen best superhero films ever made, Ragnarok was also great, but here the character has become almost unrecognizable. What a letdown.[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]And speaking of Asgard, a shout-out to Rene Russo, who's marvellous. She absolutely kills the scene(s) that she is in. We sure could have used more of her.[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]There's a totally fun bit on the big battlefield where all the *female* superheros gather to form a united front. More please! This had better not be just tokenism. For example, Wanda (Scarlet Witch) is shown once again to be one of the very few heroes who was able to genuinely hurt Thanos. GIVE THIS WOMAN A MOVIE!! It doesn't hurt that Elizabeth Olsen is a first-rate actor.[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]There's so much material that it's just an embarrassment of riches. By trying not to leave anyone out in this Grand Finale, the Russos have shortchanged various scenes that could have been better. And there are loads of deserving characters, like Valkyrie, Black Panther, Shuri, Wasp, Dr. Strange, Wong ... Too much in the last hour felt rushed.[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]And about time travel. I'm not particularly giving anything away to say that it's there just like everyone expected. But just like all other time travel plots, (a) it's fun but (b) this version of it doesn't make any more sense than any other movies built on the device. Bizarre logic, plot holes, missing pieces; it seems fine as it's happening, but you're left scratching your head after the credits roll."
5078,"3 hours of boredom, pain, suffering and cheap fan service. One of the most overrated movies."
5079,"Do two wrongs make a right? Well, the makers of this film and Marvel studios appear to think so. After realising the folly of one blockbuster, the correction is attempted by doing another.[換行字元][換行字元]Avenger: Infinity War and its sequel Endgame, are said to have been made 'back to back' and that means it's not an accident in film making. For those who have NOT seen Infinity, it is made clear in the initial sequences of Endgame that 'half of the life across the universe' had recently been disintegrated by Thanos (played convincingly by Josh Brolin ) and his men, using the power gained from the Infinity Stones ( Time, Mind, Space, Power, Soul and Reality).[換行字元][換行字元]Tony Stark (Iron Man, played wearily by Robert Browney Jr.) and Nebula (Thanos's step daughter, played passionately by Karen Gilan) fighting the war are saved narrowly from verge of death by Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel played by a marble faced Brie Larson). Steve Rogers (Captain America, played by an unsure Chris Evans), Natasha (Black Widow, played by an emotional Scarlett Johansson) and Nebula fail to entice Stark (who prefers a retired life with his family) to get into action in order to retrieve the stones, and the world. But they manage to recruit Bruce Banner (Hulk played by a committed Mark Ruffalo), Thor (played by a beer-bellied Chris Helmsworth, coz his character now drinks a lot of beer) and James Rhodes (War Machine, played by a straight forward Don Cheadle) and together they go in search of Thanos to retrieve the Stones. Thanos declares that he has destroyed the stones soon after they served the purpose of destruction. Was Thanos lying? No. (Nebula: my dad may be whatever, a liar he is not). In a fit of rage, Thanos' head is chopped off by Thor.[換行字元][換行字元]When everything seems lost, Scott Lang (Ant-Man played comically by Paul Rudd ) arrives on the scene - just recovered from a time warp that he underwent - for him the past five years he spent in the quantum realm seemed like just five hours. So it's hypothesised that if you could somehow get into the warp, you can reach different points in time in the past, in order to reverse or avert the damages done at that time and return to the present. (Obviously, a concoction of Max Planck and Albert Einstein there, for novices in physics.) Stark joins the team, and together they make the time station (after a few failed comical attempts). They rope in all the remaining Marvel heroes for the big act. The plan is set: the team must get hold of the stones from their original sources, before Thanos 'had' laid hands on them, and eventually must protect the world from the devastation that anyway did not take place![換行字元][換行字元]The rest of the movie is all about bringing the plan into action: and the action must've brought some fun, especially for the kids. In the end, just one billion $ box office question remains: In the time warp created by Marvel's movie makers, had the Endgame been made first, would there have been a need for the first (Infinity War)? No? And in that case, would there have a need for the second? That would have a happier ending...."
5080,"The movie was ok, not willing to watch the 2nd time"
5081,"First off, hats off to the Russo brothers, they have crafted something spectacular. Something that will be remembered for years. It isn't easy to make something like this. To culminate 11 years of movies, 21 films, and do it by tying things together, honoring the fans and most importantly honoring the characters. Yet the Russo's have pulled off just that. I've seen it twice now.[換行字元][換行字元]Now before we get into the positives, let's get the nitpicks out of the way. (Don't worry I won't spoil anything). The movie isn't perfect, but is damn near close. Some aspects of the first act felt sort of rushed, but I suppose it was necessary in order for the film to touch on all the aspects it had to touch on. Even though the climax is absolutely mind blowing, there are some decisions they decided to make in regards to a character that I felt could have been written differently. At least that's what I was thinking while watching it, but the film's final moment made me forgive all of it. There are some other minor nitpicks here and there, but I'm not that kind of person, so let's get into the positives.[換行字元][換行字元]Believe me, it's hard to discuss this movie without getting into spoilers, but I'll do my best. The first act is a little slow, but at no point did I feel bored(some people might, BUT NOT US). This act was necessary to establish the dire state of our heroes and of mankind in general following the events of Infinity war. This part of the film definitely focuses more on character development as well as drama. The film then really gets going, and my oh my were they successfull with the middle act. They did a great job of honoring everything that lead up to the endgame, and the comedy was perfectly sprinkled throughout. I won't say much more, as this review is already getting long. But I have to state again that this is an epic (and I mean EPIC) conclusion to the infinity saga. They make some bold decisions. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will definitely be satisfied. The whole theater clapped as the credits started rolling.[換行字元][換行字元]What a film, check it out no matter what. Thank you Joe and Anthony Russo."
5082,"At a serious loss for words with this one all i can say is experience it for yourself and take fron it what you can, because theres just so much given to the fans of this franchise in this movie. Don't expect fist fights from start to finish movie is far more then that!"
5083,Honestly I found the first two hours to be pretty boring. A lot of it seemed unnecessary and drawn out to me but the final hour definitely picked up and was amazing. I was close to giving this a 7 but the end definitely had me emotional which never happens to me so clearly it had an effect on me! Great performances by RDJ and Chris Evans. Not so great performance by Scarlett Johansson though. Everyone else was good although Thor's issues were kind of too much after a while.
5084,"I have seen numerous marvel movies and i knew that this one was going to be good, but it took my breath away. i laughed, i cheered, i clapped, i cried. absolutely a perfect ending to such an incredible story. ahhh i'm still in shock over how good it was"
5085,"Not sure why people rated so high for this pure entertaining hero movie. To me, a non-fan, it's still far from something called EPIC."
5086,"The Marvel franchise has deteriorated into a soap opera for boys. Since boys prefer sports soap operas no one expects this disaster train to keep chugging along much longer; unless, of course, they can switch the fan base to girls. Girls love soap operas. As a soap opera, it seems below average in acting and emotional involvement. The Sci-Fi in Marvel has always been weak, and what passes for science in the Avengers is just plain silly. It's really Fantasy.[換行字元][換行字元]The old players are dropping out as fast as they can and the new players are generic also-rans. One surprise was Thor, who was able to make the transition from unlikable to lovable. The rest are just showing up, like on a Loveboat Reunion episode. Antman is a decent actor but he's hopelessly unlikable. Hulk looks shockingly cartoon-like: badly scaled, textured and warped; it couldn't be more obvious that he was layered into the scenes. With today's technology, it's a real insult to people who actually paid to see this convoluted yawn to have to watch such shoddy CGI.[換行字元][換行字元]Audience suspension of disbelief is not necessary because the plot is so turgid and dull. My wife slept through it twice. She thought she might be able to make it through the second time, but alas she failed. It's just too boring. Even the paradoxes are uninspiring. I say this because everyone seemed to be saying that Endgame was a good movie. Doesn't anyone know what a good movie is anymore? Has the bar been lowered that much? You want recent Sci-Fi that grabs your mind and your heart? Watch Edge of Tomorrow (2014). That movie was everything this one wasn't. In Time (2011), Children of Men (2006), Fifth Element (1997), Chappie (2015), Bright (2017), Surrogates (2009), even the original Guardians of the Galaxy was better than this mess.[換行字元][換行字元]Kids are going to watch what kids like, but sometimes I'm not sure I believe them. There's too many shills out there, too many ""grassroots"" marketing posts. There's simply not enough to like in Avengers Endgame for it to be as popular as it apparently is. We don't need to be this desperate! As recent as 2017, Will Smith made a Fantasy drama that is great by anyone's standard. There's more to come; we are just in a low spot. Once this Marvel Comic-Con fashion fades things will brighten up again."
5087,"This is one of the greatest action/sci-fi movies I have ever seen. Amazing emotional ride, great acting, amazing CGI, the best of the bests made an honorable ending of an amazing era. And we could be a part of it. This is how you end an amazing series this is how you make an action/sci-fi movie this is 110% professionalism.

5090,"Good CGI, script is built up on a lack of basic logic and reasoning. Then again... is it that big of a surprise? Love this somewhere in the 300-400 range."
5091,"The movie lacked anything substantial. Infinity war was an epic yet end game tried to cram 21 movies into one. Plot holes everywhere with very little tying the movie together. It was almost too obvious with the direction of the plot. Infinity war had several stories which tied into one, yet endgame tried to do the same but got lost in too much meaningless jokes. Im really sorry for marvel studios but this was by far the worst movie in the marvel universe. Yes the fight scenes were good but the overall delivery was clunky and missing direction. I left the cinema super disappointed as the expectation was hyped up but the delivery was way below that expectation. I watched infinity war 3 times in the cinema, but i wished i waited for DVD for endgame, massive waste of money. Pretty much 2.5 hours of boring jokes and 30 mins of actual viewing pleasure. Anyone who votes this film above 4/10 has issues. The funny thing is, everyone online agrees with me............."
5092,"...only to - after almost 2.5 hours of boring preparation - end up in a happy ending and of course more CGI laden version of ""Avengers: Infinity war"" with all the protagonists ever to have been in Marvel movies appearing on screen in a CGI festival which shows the true dilemma of modern movie making and the the Marvel world in special. They wanna pack it all in and in the end they get nothing, mixing it all up in a terrible way. We suddenly have Captain America to hold Mjölnir, Pepper Potts got a suit and fights (aargh!),Scarlet Witch seems to be the most dangerous opponent to Thanos, Thanos being apparently stronger without the stones (so don't go for them, dumb ass!) and among that all we have valkyrie riding her winged horse, just to mention a few. The only good scenes are the ones with Thor, and they are also the only ones where the emotional side is delivered in a believable way. Which is also a hint where the true magic of such movies _could_ be: telling stories of myths and magic, and not CGI overkill movies. Sadly, that's what we got once more, and the typical US approach anyway. So, this movie is nothing but 2.5 hours of time waste to end up in roughly 20 minutes of senseless CGI pseudo battle. If you watch it to be able to judge for yourself and get another idea of contemporary movie making, you can do that while making the dishes or doing something else useful in parallel."
5093,"No spoilers. This is it. What a huge tribute it has been. One of very few Hollywood movie which my eyes soaked in tears at the end of the movie. The greatest crossover movie so far in the cinematic universe, it's an absolute tsunami of epic. It's been an emotional, a feel of never ending grief for the characters you loved. Whatever it has taken for an Avengers, certainly taken emotions out of a child inside every MCU FAN. Standing ovation in a theatre, people clapping and shouting for their favorite heroes was a goosebumps moment. ""Avengers Assemble"" was an unimaginable and unthinkable."
5094,"Please don't waste your time with this one. This movie was the worst, most cringeworthy waste of a good story I have ever seen."

It is so long, large and grand that everytime I focus on some aspect I realise new elements I like or dislike.[換行字元][換行字元]To some extent this is key to the problem. I found the first part of the movie enjoyable, both on entertainment but also in regards to the expectations one has to ""the end of an era"".[換行字元][換行字元]It tries so hard to cover every aspect of the world that I felt that it was waaaaay to obvious in the story. Regarding this I truly feel like the movie would be better with two parts of equal length.[換行字元][換行字元]Throughout the entire movie I felt like it took every expected turn it could. Sure it tries to throw you curve balls, but when you on hindsight think about it you never really get surprised.

And what a downfall it would be.[換行字元][換行字元]I know that marvel is a moneygrabbing greed machine that does its best to stay within the largest group of viewers expectations.

5097,"If there was any way to end this Marvel series of movie's, this was it! That's alI I can say...you all NEED to see it for yourselves, to experience all the emotions. Everyone did a fantastic job!"
5098,"Yes! Movie is like a rollercoaster, emotional yet satisfying. Many complained about the slow beginning, but truly necessary to build character. We all know who the Avengers are, they are heroes! But they are also human. The movie makes them more human with emotions than any other movie in the Marvel universe. The beginning was a little slow but yet fast pace, it took me some time to understand what exactly was occurring. VERDICT: see it at theater for the experience, own it- see again and again- just maybe Easter eggs will be found."
5099,Awesome movie loved it. Dobt want to spoil thats why not writing anymore
5100,"Ohh boy. All the reviews are correct. Amazing movie. Only problem is someone wasn't really thinking in the writing room that well. Why didn't Thor, Cap Marvel, or Hulk just use the gauntlet?

5101,"Iron Man was my first Marvel movie that I have ever watch. I can't believe time flies so fast. Who would have thought a superhero movie could bring you so much feelings and emotions? 11 years, and 22 movies all combined into such a masterpiece that is Endgame. I'm glad to be alive to experience this entire journey. Thank you Marvel for making my life better!"
5102,"Not better than Infinity War, hence, overrated, in terms of logical story telling, pace of the story and 'balancing' the story."
5103,"This was probably one of the worst movie I have seen, even on the Marvel scale. How can they take so many talented actors and make this non-sense? I laughed every time emotional drama came. Instead of tears, I was was feeling pity for myself. I hope this is really the endgame. But I doubt."
5104,"I had intentions of what I wanted to see going into #avengersendgame, and after seeing the movie I was very pleased. The MCU knows how to bring the characters to life in a cinematic fashion that exceeded my expectations 100 times over. After investing so much in the characters for the 20 some odd movies I got emotional but a good a good emotional. I know realize why I got into film because I like telling stories that have heart. I give #avengersendgame a 9 and a half out of 10. Keep the MCU going bringing our childhood to life."
5105,"The movie is everything you want it to be and more. I was never bored in a single moment. The best part of the movie is watching them work and how they fit so much into a 3 hour movie which u would not want to miss a minute of. The movie opens with a subtle reference to infinity to spark ur memory of what happened at the end. The end made all 22 movies worth the watch and sets up the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe perfectly. You will happy, excited, and sad throughout the film. Without one of the best Marvel movies and best theater experience."
5106,Alright. It was sort of like Avengers 3 meets Back to the Future. Good action and a nice little conclusion to phase 3 or 4 of the Marvel universe.
5107,"Kinda slow eh? Long drawn out scenes where nothing. not even music is playing. Hulk did nothing, Thor was fat the whole movie,...and The biggest flop Ms marvel did nothing and was in the movie for 6 seconds in a less than spectacular final fight scene. Other than that the movie was pretty great...just slower and not as interesting as Infinity War."
5108,"This movie is all That I wanted from a movie for a long time im still on the hypetrain eventhough I am a couple of tv show episodes behind but I try to clear everything up, cant wait until future project."
5109,Finally we got a worthy ending to the dc universe heroes with this 22nd and final film in the saga. 3 hours of entertainment which will leave u wanting more. although not as great as part 3 was still this is worth of your time as u get entertained often with lots of laughs and a lots of flashbacks as we get to see the past many times as that was the plot in this movie. this is one of the worthy dc films as we got a ton of those in last decade due to high $$$ earnings and not all of them were good. at least the last two avengers movies were great. now I hope we get a big break from those movies until they figure out what they will bring next. thank you marvel for a wonderful journey all those past years.[換行字元][換行字元]Grade // B+
5110,This is the perfect ending for the infinity saga as they call it ...I enjoyed every second .. multiple goosebumps... tears ...laughs... it is truely awesome and got no words that could describe how I feel ... loved it so much ...thank you marvel ... thank you so much.
5111,Lazy plotline used(timetravel) a good climax but the rest was pretty boring. Only people who love the mcu would think this is an above average movie.
5112,"Usually the phrase came full circle is used way to often without meaning but in the sense of Avengers: Endgame Marvel did just that, wrapping up 10 years of storytelling and movies all really well. This movie is really once in a lifetime and there will never be another movie like this one.[換行字元][換行字元]What I really enjoyed about this movie is that it really took its time with the plot and when the action came it really delivered on all fronts. Sometimes it took too long to get going especially with a 3 hour run time but it was never boring and you just kept getting intrigued with the story elements. When the movie starts it's right off Infinity War and did really well to establish the consequences of the last movie and to let the characters experience the fallout of Infinity War and that was really interesting.[換行字元][換行字元]As I said the movie really took its time with it plot sometimes it just felt a little too dragged on as it left the directors wanted to over-establish some plot points instead of just keeping it simple but I wouldn't say it's a major issue it's just that in a 3 hour runtime you don't need to over complicate the plot. However though the story was really fantastic, if I haven't said it before the Russo Brothers are geniuses they managed to wrap up 10 years worth of storytelling in one movie brilliantly from the First IronMan movie till now. They really cared for each character and managed to create resolutions for almost every single one again well done Russo's.[換行字元][換行字元]Speaking of characters, obliviously there were a lot characters like Infinity War but Endgame was really about the conclusion of the original six Avengers from IronMan, Black Widow, Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye and Thor. Each one had an arc and came to satisfying conclusions by the end of the movie. The really surprising performance came from Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye or Ronin who we didn't see on Infinity War and had a really nice story that involved him and his family and the events of Infinity War and how it impacted him. Robert Downey Jr gave the best performance as usual ,Nebula,Ant-Man and Black Widow we're also good in this movie and had one of the more interesting plots of the movie. Captain Marvel was fine. Chemistry between gwyneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Jr was good as always. In all honesty no one gave a bad performance in this movie they all did really well so that's another plus.[換行字元][換行字元]Now Thanos played by Josh Brolin who had a very big role in Infinity War and was a fantastic villain and was one of the best if not the best thing about Infinity War played a small role in Endgame, I mean he was still Thanos he was badass, menacing and obviously had some memorable lines. He wasn't in the movie all that much except for in the beginning and largely shows up at the end of the movie for the final showdown and that was kinda disappointing, but with the story the Russos went for you could understand why he wasn't in it that much but still it was kind of disappointing. Thanos was still a great villain in Endgame all that being said and you could fell The after effects he imposed after Infinity War. Without saying too much Thor and Hulk were the twist characters in this movie I mean they did some surprising stuff with them at first I was like Marvel what did you do but in the case of Hulk it turned out all right but Thor...lets just say I didn't like what they did to him or his arc(if that's what you wanna call it) was disappointing it's like they used hot laughs.[換行字元][換行字元]The humor was good for the most part of course this is a Marvel movie so forced humor played a factor(sorry if you keep seeing this in all my Marvel review but it is what it is) especially in the case of Thor I mean Endgame didn't ruin the character of Thor but it's like they were trying to ruin him if that makes sense. There wasn't really a lot of action in the first and second half of the movie maybe one action scene in the second act to keep things fast paced, in fact there were like 2 or 3 action scenes in the whole movie(I'll talk about the final battle just hold on). I mean that was really surprising that a superhero movie managed to keep me intrigued for that much with so little action so again hats off to the Russo's for a compelling and interesting story. Now let's talk about the final battle, yes it was Epic I usually don't describe anything as Epic but the final battle of Endgame was truly a spectacle and I'm glad I got to see it. It was filled with tense moments, awesome comic book action, drama and truly some wonderful surprises, it had it all that I think the final battle was the best action set piece in all of Superhero movie history just truly phenomenal action.[換行字元][換行字元]The tone of this movie was lighter than I expected after the events of Infinity War I mean it's not a bad thing, when the movie got dark and serious you felt it. Endgame was part adventure so I guess you'd expect some lighter tones in some aspect but the tone was really well balanced for the most part. The third act was really the best part of the whole movie and I mean the whole last act, there were some nail biting moments, epic action and wonderful storytelling and heart breaking scenes. Without saying too much Endgame delt with Time and some people are already saying that caused major plot holes in the movie and unanswered question were left but for me I didn't mind cause I enjoyed what the did and it came up with some heart warming moments with characters like Thor,Tony Stark and Captain America so I really don't care if there were plot holes or not caused what I saw on screen was wonderful.[換行字元][換行字元]So Avengers: Endgame was a really great movie, had awesome characters, an intriguing story, it was fun, had funny humor, fantastic action, really heartbreaking moments and a satisfying conclusion.Sure there were a few things a didn't like for instance some baffling character decisions or some dragged on scenes but for the most part all I have to say in a nutshell, Thank You Marvel."
5113,Soooooo bouring !! called action movie ??? seriously ! it is actually a sleeping pills !
5114,"Amazing movie, couldn't have asked for better, combination of emotions,war and sacrifices, it was the best time to end this avengers' Era, and the way Russo brothers did it, they nailed it. Go and watch this movie in theatre, this is a masterpiece that you don't wanna miss. Thank you avengers for being with us so long and entertained us for so long time."
5115,Marvel honestly couldn't have ended it better. Full stop.
5116,"First of all - this movie had to be brilliant to back up all the hype and legacy from earlier films. So is it brilliant? No, it's not even close.[換行字元][換行字元]Second of all - Endgame just isn't a very good movie in any noteworthy sense, outside of effects and really good action scenes. And this brings me back to my first point. Perhaps this formula would work during the rise of comic films, but I can't see this film as anything but a huge disappointment.[換行字元][換行字元]After a brutally emotional opening scene, that I have to admit - is really good, Endgame then proceeds to jump from scene to scene with inconsistent tone, pace, and development. A serious movie can have great humor, but the way Endgame uses slapstick humor, and non-serious characters is, well - silly. Is this a serious movie or not? Many of the films rules or conventions are openly broken to serve secondary storylines, and much of the 'science' is just plain dumb. I can suspend disbelief and get into stylized movies, but so much of this movie just comes off shallow and not really well thought out.[換行字元][換行字元]This includes the story arc that to me has little natural flow. Many comic movies today seem to come off more as bad, incomplete TV episodes that rely on being part of a series for relevance. Movies should never be like that, and Endgame felt to me like three TV episodes jammed together, with three to five tac-on false endings.[換行字元][換行字元]While I really liked many of the action scenes, which are clearly well conceived and beautiful to watch - at this point action scenes should be a given, and the story should have the same excellence. I don't feel like I'm being to picky when great movies in the Marvel universe exist (Dr. Strange for instance). I don't consider Infinity War one of them, but it's a heck of a lot better than Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]To me, outside of the opening scene, all the emotional moments fall absolutely flat. Considering the conclusion of Infinity War - there is a blatantly obvious sequence that should exude the epitome of joy. This part of the movie is hard to explain without giving spoilers, but in my opinion - this sequence is the writers biggest failure of the movie. The reunions are not well executed.[換行字元][換行字元]Objectively, this movie probably deserves a 6 for production values, great action, and resolving the Infinity War outcome. But subjectively? I really thought this movie kinda sucked."
5117,"This film is very, very great and is the end of 10 years of a series of superheroes. Thanks Marvel"
5118,My boyfriend truly loves anything Marvel. I would usually pass on watching any robot or superhero movie but I had the chance to watch Infinity Wars. OMG! I was hooked and so we went to see Endgame. I have now doubled back to watch all of the prior films I missed so I understand each character. I am now a true fan of Marvel. Jus how much of a fan you might ask------I cried about Tony Starks.
5119,Whole family loved it. Took about 15 people. Marvel didnt disapoint.
5120,The movie ends after the first 15 minutes... Very disappointed
5121,"The best marvel movie so far. A perfect wrap-up of everything that has happened. It had a good story, funny jokes, emotional scenes and times where you wanted to cheer. It would be hard to get a better movie than the one we got so i feel it deserves a perfect score."
5122,Best movie i have ever seen. This movie will be remebered for centuries.
5123,I've never done this before but the movie is so great I was willing to vote.
5124,"What a movie. perfect justice for each character. superb story. 10/10 acting , cinematography , superb movie ever. must watch ."
5125,"Yawn.. we get it[換行字元][換行字元]90% of the people in the audience knows what is going on with the crew and what they need to do, I don't think we needed all that time and so many un-needed scenes and storyline that didn't matter. Acting was good, comedy was solid, a little too child friendly banter but oh well.. overall 7/10!"
5126,"After watching this complete. Endgame it's great. Any person that had some experience with the MCU will at least enjoy this one. The thing with with this movie, is that it is not just a movie. This is the final chapter of eleven years of history. The end of a beautiful rollercoaster."
5127,"This movie was everything. Many people don't understand when you're invested into fictitious characters so much but the writers clearly do. They wrote the characters in such a human way it's amazing. Even the godly characters suddenly felt vulnerable. In all honesty, I cried like a b*tch I mean waileddd. Numerous trolls popped up in the internet and declared their hate of the movie but they're obviously trying to seek other people's attention and have that one minute fame thing. But after every negative comment I want you to think of this: this movie took character development to a whole new level, it took shock factor to a whole new level. It's been hours since I watched this movie yet I am still in shock and tears. The fact that a film can have this much effect on someone is crazy ,yet, it does. This is because the way they portrayed the characters is so phenomenal that one can't help but completely fall in love with them. If you are like me and you love these characters then I suggest you take a box of tissues with you. I have never been this saddened by a movie scene."
5128,Marvel has always been a huge part of my childhood ever since I watched Iron Man. Endgame was an extremely emotional and well directed film.
5129,"Avengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and so on.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers 3 ended with Thanos carrying out the Snap and wiping out half of all life across the universe, including certain prominent Marvel heroes who fans already know must return in some form for their own movies.

I'm just not entirely sure it helped an already overloaded film find its tone or pacing.[換行字元][換行字元]It is a great movie, highly enjoyable and does a remarkable job servicing the entire array Marvel movies that have come before. If sometimes it feels a little self-indulgent and self-revereantial, that is understandable and forgivable. I just wish it had been a tiny bit bolder and more brutal in its choices."

In many parts ive been surprised with very unexpected scenes, and you sure will too. Just trust and dont lose this absolut movie."
5134,We have witness something that we will never ever forget from marvels....

5143,I love this movie by the script by actress performances i follow the all avengers movie this movie is final movie with main avengers but i always remember my favorite main avengers and i am dam shore this movie break all Hollywood and Bollywood or any other film industry record love you my five main avengers i always remember you 🙏❤
5144,The title says it all!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!
5145,"This was a well thought out, superb conclusion for the culmination of 22 movies in 10 years. It is without a doubt the spectacle of of the decade. The movie obviously deals out tons of fans service, but is still one of the best super hero movies to ever be created."
5146,A garbage with full of unpleasant characters and boring story and i call that a real charlatanism to stole your money and giving you a 3 hours long headache with minimum suspense and bad cgi and nothing more. i hope we never saw that characters anymore and never have such garbage anymore.
5147,"The best word to describe the film is ""epic"". If you rewind time back to ten years ago and tell me a superhero movie can be this grandiose, this emotional and this impactful I wouldn't believe a word you say. Endgame does everything any Marvel fan could want, it serves as a tearful, emotional goodbye to some of the staples of The Universe and as a wonderful way to look forward to what is yet to come. It serves each and every single character from the past ten years justice and allows all of their personalities to flow out. The amount of work the team has put into this, the respect it has to this wondrous world of imagination is unfathomable to me, and the tribute it pays to past works deserves the utmost respect. This is truly the epitome of modern cinema, it doesn't need a killer plot (which it isn't), it is the fruit of ten years of hard work and pent-up emotion all unleashed in one single blow. Endgame is dare I say the perfect way wrap up phase one of Marvel Cinema, and makes me truly look forward to phase two."
5148,"This movie deserves a 10/10 however one thing should be said that narrative wise, it cannot stand on it's own. Other than that be sure that you will have a great time. And a lot of heartfelt moments of nostalgia. And 10 different levels of awesome one could not believe was imaginable."
5149,"After watching endgame I felt nothing special,it was completely predictable and disapointing ending, just like every superhero movie the bad guy loses and the good guys win, garbage, it was a long boring movie with the only special thing to show for it is the 45 minute long mess of horrible cgi they call a ""final battle"""
5150,"Great movie , the best marvel movie ever , you should watch it immediately"
5151,"I have to start of by saying that i'm not the biggest Avengers fan but i really enjoyed Infinity war. I saw the movie on the new Odeon Imax theather in Oslo and i was blown away in every aspect. Not only was the 3D effects better than I had ever seen, the movie it self was awsome. I could write on and on about all the obvious reasons to why Infinity war was great one but what hit me the most was the nice pace and tempo of the movie and besides the plot worked well. Compared to Endgame which in my opinion is a very slow movie. The Avengers kept on talking and talking on and on.. and then they plotted and then they talk some more about what they where plotting. I mean the action never came. For me what makes the avengers movies good is the pace of the movies and their ability to solve problems on the go. This one didn't have that it's to stationary, to slow to whiney. All of that though would be fine had the plot worked, but it didn't, it was to far fetched and it felt like it was rushed. They dug a hole they couldn't climbe out of. After two hours with no action i lost my patient and walked out of the theater. I'm not saying it was that bad but i just didn't feel it and i was left pretty much very dissatisfied."
5152,"There is a lot of spam 1 star ratings on here. Not sure why. Perfect ending to a great storyline. It had a bit of everything but tied the MCU up in a nice bow. Not without it's crazy plot twists. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!"
5153,"It was always going to be a challenge to create a movie that neatly ties up a decade of continuity and juggles a cast of characters built up over 22 films and the fear was that End Game was going to be anticlimactic. Fans do not fear, the Russo's have crafted a near perfect film from its heart wrenching opening to its close. You'll laugh, you'll cheer, you'll weep and you'll leave the cinema pretty happy with the experience. If you are new to the Marvel Universe then this is not for you and will appear to be a jumbled mess of a film but for anyone who has been in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since Iron Man back in 2008 this is everything you wanted to see."
5154,"I have to admit I enjoyed this film but maybe my expectations were too high. I found the conclusion to be disappointing on many fronts. He did the resolution for three of the characters. It was unnecessary and out of character but I won't go into spoilers. The russos ended on a sour note but it was a hell of a run. I'm afraid the MCU will descend into sjw nonsense from here on out. So, goodbye MCU I love you!"
5155,"You remember watching Last Jedi? Thinking, ""Eventually this will turn into a Star Wars movie, right?"" This movie feels the same. Huge boring disappointment."

5160,Overall Endgame was a solid movie. The first hour of the film may seem a little sluggish but the action and story telling makes up for it. The ending and fight scenes were amazing. Overall good film u recommend watching a couple times in theater and adding to your home video collection.
5161,"...as a whole anyways.[換行字元][換行字元]I venture in from time to time. In total, I've seen probably 10-15 percent of any and all of the combined universes.

They capture my now lost youth, plain and simple, and I guess I hesitantly embrace this.[換行字元][換行字元]You dont watch this for the acting or the dialogue. You watch for action, splody stuff, and good v evil. All are prevalent, all are fun sequences to watch unfold and the third act delivers the goods.[換行字元][換行字元]No spoilers but it's a bit melodramatic for my liking at times, but prepare yourself for an onslaught of Easter eggs, cameos and a tidy enough ending for me to give this one the appreciative nod of approval.[換行字元][換行字元]7 stars."
5162,The movie had some bad points but mostly it was amazing also when iron man dies it's so sad
5163,More than half of the movie is boring with a very bad script

5165,"Out of all the hundreds and hundreds of movies I have seen in my life, nothing even comes close to comparison to Endgame. This is not just ""another super hero movie"" this movie will tear your soul apart and have you screaming in joy in the seat of your chair. From stunning cinematography, to absolutely superb acting this movie encompasses the epitome of a movie going experience. Hats off to the Russo brothers for creating and giving the devoted marvel fans a perfect ending to a saga that has become a close part of all of our lives."
5166,"Congratulations MCU on creating this 21-film cinematic feat. Was I expecting a better finish? Yes. Did I see the same movie as everyone else - it appears not. [edit: I've rewatched the movie a month later and found it more satisfying. This was the version with the post credits stuff to get us back in to push the box office into record territory. It's exactly the same movie, mind you. The character arcs are just great and the actors up to the task. My 3 key problems with the fillem are 1; The camera work for the special effects sequences are thoroughly inventive BUT the camera work for the post-trauma character studies is not inventive at all. Those scenes relied on the multi-movie character arc and sentiment more than camera direction and cinematography. Still worked for the lass behind us who was sobbing for the last third of the moofie. 2; the story is great until the time travel gobbledygook when I felt the emotive aspect lost momentum. 3; it's still hard to care as much about MCU characters as much as, say, the original Star Wars characters because in the MCU you know there's another injection of super hero greatness only months away. In the original Star Wars moofies it was years before you saw any characters again so the emotional impact was more profound. OK, so these points are all probably shrewd directorial choices and generational differences. Impressive, ambitious fillem overall] I found this move a bit of a snoozefest. The problem is, by another other movie's standards this was quite a good film. It tried for different tones and a different pace. I think a part of the problem is these movies that they shoot back-to-back. They really need a break in between films to look at the first part, ie, Infinity Wart, and see what they set up in that film. They then need to sit down and answer all of the key points that were raised in that film AND in all the previous MCU fillems. That would require a multi-layered script and a production that really turns up the ante. To me it seemed like the series really ended with Infinity Wart and this Endgame was like, the ultimate post-credits sequence. The final battle was awesome but non-sensical. Who IS the most powerful superdude/ette and why can't she (MarVel) beat Thanos? That stuff frustrates me. I mean, I was ready for the Scarlett Witch to tear him a new one but even that hope fizzled. I'll re-watch it on blu ray but I'm glad everyone else liked it. I'll always have my Return of the Jedi and Return of the King."
5167,"To avoid any more suggestion of spoilers, I'll say this - the cast, cinematography, story - it's all well done. And if this is the last Marvel ever made, it would be the most fitting and perfect of endings. It does have a few minor flaws in its story, but with so many moving parts in this three hour epic (that is shockingly self-contained), you can forgive it for its awesomeness."
5168,You know when I saw this I was sad but I guess everyone was tired of doing these movies
5169,"A satisfying ending to a saga that has been going on for 11 years... not a cinematic masterpiece by any means, But fulfilled my comic book-nerdy needs. 9/10. It's good and you should see this movie. Dialogue: The writing isn't great but has it ever been in these films? (Ok Logan had a pretty good script) Acting: Maybe it's just me because I've asked 3 of my friends what they thought and they said the expected better... but I thought Downey was amazing in this CGI: Great Directing: a pretty Good job by the Russo Brothers"

5172,The movie was really good and OH MY GOD The ending was so good and made me feel sad and happy it was so good thanks to marvel for the movie
5173,I don't have a lot to say but this was amazing work. The combination of all the great Marvel movies in the past 11 years to get this. Also so many references and jokes that were really funny especially if you know the movies well.
5174,This film is better than what I hoped it would be. It's an absolutely amazing movie all the way through. I loved every second of it. What a way to finish the Infinity Saga!!!!
5175,"It is absolutely the best....I can say without doubt...there are many movies in the universe...but endgame is one in a billion....action packed,emotional ... good story...full of humour. There's nothing like it"
5176,The day has come where all comes to an end. The hype was high and so do the ratings and although I am not a marvel comics fan (but a movie's one) I must agree with it. This is probably the best marvel movie ever.[換行字元][換行字元]After 10 years all comes to this and I must sat it is a good way to end. All good things come to an end and so do the avengers. Now we can only wait and see what Disney will do but nothing will ever be the same.[換行字元][換行字元]Meanwhile I will sit on a corner a decide what to do with my life!!
5177,After Infinity War I had huge expectations. Unfortunately I think it doesn't follow the comic book at all because they wanted some kind of closure of the story. I saw a lot of 10 star reviews and I cannot believe the majority of people like this movie more than Infinity War. I'm not saying it wasn't entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story. There are moments in the movie where the rules from all other Marvel movies are broken and characters which were build over hours of screen time were reduced in order to make space for others. The story is average at best with big flaws.
5178,I think this is the conclusion of a decade of phenomenal MCU movies. I feel sense of emotion and pride after watching this movie. All scenes are important and I think I have to watch this movie at least three times. 😊. I am curious about the MCU next phase.
5179,"Yeah, it was a little messy and chaotic but still, it was great! Not what I expected at all but exactly THAT makes it outstanding good for me. No predictable storyline, extraordinary funny moments (still smiling when I think about what happened to the Thor character) sad parts, simply an allover entertaining and exciting experience. It was refreshing to see all characters just as human beings for a while and how in the end they got it all together. Sure, not everything made sense especially when it comes to time traveling...but hey, its not a realistic drama or thriller...its a superhero movie and for me they nailed it and made it an epic final one. :) Cant wait for my first Avengers marathon!"
5180,"For those of us invested in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I can't imagine a better payoff after 22 feature films."
5181,The best MCU movie i've ever seen. And I could not control my sobbing during certain scenes which I am not going to spoil it here just for you guys. You all have to see this!!!!!!! A must watch.
5182,We've had a countdown in our house since the date was released and the movie still met and exceeded my expectations. Loved every part of it. So well done.
5183,"The haters are still mad over Captain Marvel; Go and enjoy the best Comic Book movie ever made. You will not regret it. I laughed, I cried and I loved this movie."
5184,"Beautiful, exciting, unexpected, emotional, sad and funny... I felt emotionally depleted 💔 after the movie but if I could I would have seen it immediately a second time! And it didn't feel like 3 hours, time flew by..."
5185,The fact that some people disliked this movie honestly baffles me. This movie beyond exceeded my expectations. It was a perfect mix of humor within sadness. Throughout the movie I would constantly get goosebumps from the sheer epicness of the moment. Truly a perfect ending to an era. I applaud the directors.
5186,"One critic said this movie was a, ""glorious conclusion"". I say it was one nutpunch after another. So..... a glorious nutpunch? Take a hanky..a ton of napkins,....something ti blot the tears away. Trust me...you're gonna need it."

Another thing we missed is the most anticipated revenge of the hulk against Thanos. Hulk has been beaten up by Thanos in infinity war and we expect a revenge from professor hulk which was not even in the film....Also the hulk lost his anger.

5200,"There are movies which leave you speechless with their storylines, with stupendous acting, with mind boggling visual effects, with sheer emotions; but varey rarely a movie comes which encapsulates all of these and much more, much much more..[換行字元][換行字元]I cried, laughed, shouted throughout the movie, something which I have not done in a long time.. Avengers End game is not just a movie. It's a rollercoaster ride of emotions, a grandeur of epic proportions.. To justify so many characters and give all of them a forfeiting end spanning over more than 10 years, is anything but easy; but Marvel does a stupendous job at it..[換行字元][換行字元]I am still a bit overwhelmed with what I just witnessed and will have to go and watch it again for the fulfilment of the void which will get created with the end of what has been an unbelievable saga of such a long span..[換行字元][換行字元]This one will stay with me for lifetime and I really don't know how Marvel will ever be able to better this .."
5201,This is by far the best movie I have ever seen. Wauw.
5202,"A cinematic masterpiece ,an allrounder.a movie which will be remembered for a very long time."
5203,"Wow... just wow those were the words I could utter after the crecits rolled on Endgame. The first act slow (and yes that's a positive) it gives room to the OG 6 to get plenty of character development and some well-deserved emotional character momemts. Exhilarating, Emotinal, Epic, and funny. most in not all the gripes are small nitpicks, not things that will make me downgrade the film's score. Two emotinal scenes left me with my jaw open and brought tears to my eyes, and yes get ready to say goodbye to multiple characters The perfect conclusion to Phase 1-3 (or the Infinty Saga as it's offically called now) and a very strong contender for best comicbook movie."
5204,Very emotional movie. And must be watching on theater
5205,"This is my first ever review.[換行字元][換行字元]I've seen thousands of movies and this is the best one I have ever seen. From anxious, to heavy hearts, to OMG this is AWESOME, it'll bring out every emotion at one point or another.[換行字元][換行字元]Hands down 10/10, would recommend."
5206,Why are you sitting here reading endgame reviews?[換行字元][換行字元]Loser.[換行字元][換行字元]Go watch it now!
5207,"When I was 18 years old I watched the first Ironman movie, the movie ended with the famous line ""I am Ironman!"", 10 years later the same dialogue but with a different emotion! The character development of the spoilt young billionaire scientist to the Selfless Saviour of the universe. Marvel set the benchmark so high that any comic book movie or any film franchise series have to try really hard to achieve what the MCU had managed to do in the last 10 years with 22 different movies![換行字元][換行字元]The way they managed to show every single important character casted in the previous Marvel movies without any unwanted fillers is really mind blowing, each scene has it's own purpose and convincingly good. I was expecting to see a back to the future cliche but what we witnessed is Epic beyond comparison. The movie made everyone to laugh, smile, awe, think, brought to the edge of the seat and definitely made everyone to weep! All the fan theories, fan dreams and wishes came true! This is not the ending we asked for but this is the endgame we deserve! Proud to be a part of the Great Marvel fandom!"
5208,"The film may start out slow, but it is an entertaining slow. The movie is great as it brings out the emotion and you really feel everything that is happening! I laughed and cried, I hurt but was satisfied! This movie also contains the single best hour and any superhero film to ever have been made. Avengers Endgame in my opinion, is the greatest superhero movie ever made!!"
5209,"One of the best, if not the best Marvel movie!!! It is really worth your money!"
5210,"Endgame will and always be my favourite superhero movie they way the put an end to certain characters is so emotional 😭😭😭steve finally got to live his life that he always wanted, tony got to say a goodbye to his father and much😭😭."
5211,"Very little it happens that what you expect ,and what you get is more than your expectation[換行字元][換行字元]The end is perfect , doesn't want to spoil the this movie with some comeback[換行字元][換行字元]Be it as it is ""WHAT EVER IT TAKES"" T"
5212,"Excellent storyline! References to the past, super heroes getting emotional too was a surprise! Unpredictable story line! Going to watch again"
5213,"This movie was a great one. I've been following the MCU since it was a thing and WOW, could this have bee pieced together more perfectly. The first like hour and a half was ok, kinda boring but the end game (no pun intended) of it was awesome."
5214,"I am not a big fan of Marvel movies. They are on average pretty dumb, makes no sense, and no internal logic or coherence, and usually ends with a horrible CGI massive and boring battle. This movie is exactly like that. But like most Marvel movies it is also very fun. The first two third of even better than average, the first act being 'The Leftovers' - Marvel edition, and the second act a fun heist movie, but the ending is so by the book and uninspiring that I was quite underwhelmed overall. If you want to see good action - MI6 last year put the bar very high, and this movie was not even close."
5215,The intro sets the theme of the whole movie and what a boring slugfest this is.
5216,"After watching this twice, I understood the story of Avengers: Endgame. The Avengers failed after the Infinity War. Never in their lifetime faced an incredible and inevitable enemy like Thanos. Josh Brolin delivers a badass Thanos. He is smart, he did the unthinkable, and he made it tough for our heroes to restore the loss. Whatever it takes was the Avengers motivation. Huge sacrifices must be taken. Seeing the Avengers rise from hopelessness and failure is the most amazing feeling in this movie. The huge price was delivered and this movie hands down is the best movie of 2019. The final battle makes it epic.[換行字元][換行字元]The Russo Brothers deliver a phenomenal film. I give them high praise for their direction and work to make this film the best. The actors and actresses are amazing, 22 movies in 10 years. All influenced into one movie. I love 3000."
5217,I really well thought out ending to great story. The best film marvel have made.
5218,It is not about action movie piew piew this movie is well directed and has a very strong story telling I already watched two times and going on third Just love it a worthy movie after 22 movies of Marvel movies
5219,"It's really not amazing - if really is flawed hugely.......none of the plot makes any sense and it has ruined future marvel movies with its awful writing......I don't understand people who have given it such a high score. If you truly step away and think about it the flaws, plot holes and disregard for future and old marvel movies - you kinda can see what a bad movie it is! My advice go read the comics - they are so much better than any marvel movie![換行字元][換行字元]Marvel have only had 2 or 3 really good movies - and about 18ish standard or awful movies......I hope they reboot the entire universe- which I'm guessing they are gonna do because of how they have messed everything up in this movie!"
5220,An amazing movie. I couldn't imagine how hard it is to live up to and end a franchise like this. They managed to make an amazing movie. Coming from a comic book lover. I don't think anyone could have done it better.
5221,A pure masterpiece superhero film ever❤ I cant explain that how much its precious it of Marvel Fans🖤🎬
5222,"The comic book hero genre is what I call ""bulk viewing"". A mass produced product that has a formula that's repeated over and over, with a few tweaks here and there, to keep the viewer coming back for more.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers: Endgame is yet another case in question. I knew it going in and was in no way surprised by a predictable end to a mostly predictable story.[換行字元][換行字元]Its not bad as such. In fact, if you can accept it for what it is, its quite watchable on a superficial level. I'll add I'm not a film snob I enjoy a simple action romp from time to time and this certainly comes recommended.[換行字元][換行字元]There's a lot of wall to wall action that's well paced and keeps kicking along. My only gripe is the overcooked ending, that's so syrupy and sentimental, you could spread it on toast.[換行字元][換行字元]7/10 from me."
5223,"Avengers endgame is an amazing movie, a perfect payoff of all previous films. The fight scenes are some of the greatest scenes ever. Gotta thank Marvel studios for this film."
5224,"The most amazing film ever made if you are a true marvel fan as a I am. I didn't know what to expect yet I was blown away and that doesn't happen to me often. I was literally speechless as I left the theater and with every step I took I couldn't believe it, a moment that i've waited for so long, over, but at the same time I was thankful of how it ended. Because I genuinely believe there wasn't a better way to end it"
5225,Avengers: Endgame is the best and most perfect movie of Marvel's cinematic universe.
5226,"Ironman came out in 2008 and eleven years later, it all comes down to this. Avengers: Endgame is a visually stunning, well-paced, emotional end to an amazing saga over the last eleven years. With superb acting from Chris Evans and Robert-Downey Jr. leading a now star-studded cast, Avengers: Endgame delivers on all the hype built up over the past year.[換行字元][換行字元]10 stars, I highly recommend you watch this must-see film the first chance you get"
5227,If you've been following marvel cinematic universe since the beginning this movie gonna make you crying and screaming but its not a dark movie however still have a lot of jokes that will make you laugh
5228,This film is 181min long and only 5min are good. The rest is just boring...
5229,We can watch this film as many times.. I wish I won't be bored.
5230,Loved the movie. Something which really frustrates me however is those who come on here and give 10/10 but it's just an over reaction.[換行字元][換行字元]I don't want to spoil and when talking about Endgame it's hard to not mention elements of the movie. Pretty much every emotion was hit throughout the 3 hours which I must admit seemed to fly by![換行字元][換行字元]Something I will say is this...... it's nothing like what I expected.
5231,I have never ever enjoyed any movie like this one. It's epic surprising ..
5232,"Marvel done very well and know what we as a fans want. Some of the movie lines u won't know if u not a hardcore marvel fans. The story plot caught me by surprise that it can done in this way. Every emotion u can think of, all can find in this movie.I like Black widow performance in this movie."
5233,I feel like endgame is what was promised to us with the mcu. It is the only comic book movie that feels like a comic book arc
5234,Not gonna give any spoiler one thing to say Expect the unexpected in the End Game

5236,"I expected so much from this film but just feel so disappointed by it. A poor and incoherent story with so many contradictions within it plus a total waste of my favourite character - amongst others (like Thanos himself). I did go and rewatch it in the cinema a second time and realised that, without all the excitement and expectation I went in with the first time I was just really really bored.[換行字元][換行字元]It did have some nice ""moments"", especially the anticipated big fight towards the end.

5238,"ENDGAME is not what you're expecting, yet it's also exactly the impressive epic you're chasing. It takes our central heroes to new places and wraps up Marvel's decade-long journey so beautifully. The ending is emotionally overwhelming. I'm thankful to the entire team for giving us a special movie that will long live in our heart."
5239,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe comes to a point where a film feels like an actual event. We have been waiting in anticipation for a year to see the final showdown that started in Infinity War. Actually, scratch that. The entire Infinity Saga started way back with Iron Man. 22 films, countless number of heroes coming together in the culminating battle against Thanos. So much anticipation, ticketing app crashes, and going through so much to try to see this on opening night. Now here we are. Does Avengers: Endgame live up to its high expectations? Absolutely. I felt like it was unique and carries the most emotional weight off anything in this universe but it absolutely serves its fans who have been loyal for years and years.[換行字元][換行字元]The film takes place three weeks after the end of Infinity War. Half of the worlds population have been wiped out by Thanos and now the remaining Avengers (who just so happen to consist summarily of the original Avengers) must find a way to not only defeat Thanos, but also avenge the fallen and find a way to counteract the actions that occurred at the end of Infinity War. As expected the film stars a gigantic cast of Hollywood's best and watch out for the cameos from heroes who have appeared previously in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[換行字元][換行字元]I really would like to talk about this film in a spoiler review but as with every review on my site, there will be no spoilers. I will say that this film has a unique take almost immediately. The humor and banter is still there as it always is and the character arcs are as fantastic as ever at its near completion. The film carries the most emotional weight as anything this universe has seen. The film has so much fan service. I think if you go early on and with a packed crowd of fans you will see just how much this means to the audience who have stayed loyal to this saga.[換行字元][換行字元]There were laughs, there were cheers, there were gasps, and yes there were tears. The film feels like it should be the very last that the MCU has to offer but of course we know there are Spider-Man and Black Panther sequels coming. The final battle brings just about everything you could hope for. If you're a fan of the series I think you will enjoy this film as it makes a case of being the best Avengers film. It goes hand in hand with Infinity War, of course both films were shot together.[換行字元][換行字元]Members of the original Avengers put on performances that do their characters the utmost justice after being on this journey for a decade. The film builds up quite slowly but once the plot takes form and the battle lines are drawn it delivers in the way the Russo brothers know how to. Th action is there, and all of what makes the Marvel Universe such a sweeping phenomenon is always there. Some characters could get more screen time, sure. You have to remember that there are so many characters that the film has to juggle and it does that admirably as it is.[換行字元][換行字元]The film will be a box office hit for sure and will be well reviewed in regards to the Universe as I can already see. I will be seeing this again tomorrow morning and have the same excitement going into a second viewing as I did my first.

5240,"Its great, enjoyable, with some of the best moments, but its obvious that Infinity War was the better film. Think Infinity War like Star Wars V, and Endgame sort of like Star Wars VI.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame sadly suffers from absolutely lazy writing, from hyping up certain characters only to give them less than 15 mins screen time in this 3 hour film, to misuse of comedic moments because they did not want the film to drag, to plotholes which no sense at all, all the way to featuring few big fight scenes and occurrence of problems driving the plot of the film. However, they did piece a well made movie at the end.[換行字元][換行字元]This film is certainly the original Avengers' swan song, some characters will not be seen again and to see them one last time here is an emotional experience, and they gave it their best shot in this film. Some characters were treated SO well and its amazing, some were absolute let down and disappointing to the point that Endgame did not need them in this film at all, which is not nice because some of these characters will continue with the new Avengers roaster.[換行字元][換行字元]Visuals are top, sound effects as well, good humor, plot is okay but can be better, acting 95% of the cast were great, emotional connection is here so you will tear up in a few scenes. Enjoy the movie, all the events from the first film, Iron Man, leads to here with a fitting conclusion. Please note there is nothing during the post credits scene other than sounds of a blacksmith hitting something. Thank you Marvel, thank you original Avengers."
5241,"I like it, it was good. Hulk was cool and nice. He remind me of my dad because my dad gets tacos too."
5242,"The dedication and acting of the cast was incredible! The score was phenomenal! Such a heartbreaker and a tear. Great movie, I do think infinity war was better."
5243,"I would say that the more emotionally invested you are, the more you can enjoy the movie. I love the fact that the directors think so carefully about how it should end. The fact that he builds every ""super heroes"" super...human. They all go through after-crisis stage. And the fact that they go above what others think about them and what they were for the greater good defines them as super heroes - not their super power. Sorry as English is not my first language. I wish you can enjoy the movie as much as i did and i always will."
5244,"1 jam yang membosankan, seharusnya dipotong. jalannya cerita terlalu lambat"
5245,It's really the movie which was promised. An epic and heartbreaking conclusion to the 22 movies saga. Endgame really worth it ! You must not miss this one. Hats off to the directors Russo Brothers . Storytelling was on the whole new level. Here's my tip to you all before watching this make sure you are ready to see the End 💔
5246,"That was a really good movie. But... Oh how i miss the down to earth Valerian, more credible and more possible , or even the last episode of GOT whose battle was way more realistic . And to much PC ! It seems that the producers wanted to please everybody , to pic the dollar from everyone . They forgot that an artist, is presenting his work, the way HE sees it, not the way Will Smith does and want or the Me Too campaigners. A 8 out of 10 is well deserved, but it could do much , much more with the resources thrown in it."
5247,Even if your not a comic book fan this is a good movie. A bit long but well written.
5248,"Don't miss out. If you want to come prepared, make sure you at least see Infinity Wars, or if possible all other Avengers movies, and even still, all other MCU movies."
5249,This movie was so amazing I love the adventure of searching and retrieving all the infinity stones I watched this movie 3 weeks ago and just now decided to write a review. The best bit was the ending war where everyone came and joined together to fight Thanos's army. 10 outta 10 the best movie i could have ever watched
5250,Awesome movie suspenseful! It is going to be the best movie of the year!
5251,"The most fans in comic history, then this is the END GAME. Lub u mcu."
5252,"If you are a comic fan this is probably the most important movie you should watch. It was a perfect tribute to the past 21 MCU movies , combining things from almost all of them. It made me cry, made me laugh and most importantly it made me feel like a kid when I watched the first iron man movie in theater. The only thing that I didn't like was the soundtrack work which copied themes from infinity war and it's impact wasn't so powerful but the movie is still 10/10 for me"
5253,"I've been on this mcu journey from the beginning and it came to the ending of this phase we all deserved. It made me laugh, surprised me even after months of fan theory videos, it took me through every emotion other than anger, I don't expect anyone to read this but as soon as I seen the rating drop from 9.2 to 9.1 I had to help it get back to the rating it deserved. To all the true fans that are reading this please do your part and give it a good rating"
5254,"It is a precious movie with a gratifying ending. This time the revenge is complex and the plot is interblended, almost outsizing any of its previous installments. It witty, amusing, thrilling, nostalgic (prepare to cry), charging and glorious. That's how an epic is concluded."
5255,This is the movie of the year! Sadly the end of an era as well...
5256,It started off alright but then it messed with time travel and it just got worse. It devolved into chaos and everyone was screwed over.
5257,I was stooned when i watched it and it was amazing
5258,"Well, let's say it changed my life! This movie is the best movie ever made!"
5259,"Wow. Just wow. This film was outstandingly amazing. I was kept on edge the entire time and the story never failed to keep me interested throughout. Initially, i was concerned that my expectations were way too high, but I was proven wrong as soon as the film started, keeping me engrossed for the entirety of the 3 hours I sat watching it. Utterly breathtaking. And it's not like those films that keep you guessing and don't give you w conclusion, this film does exactly that. At the end it really does give you the endgame. My favourite film."
5260,This movie is just flat out incredible. I have loved this franchise since the very first Iron Man and they wrapped it up beautifully in Endgame.
5261,"Avengers: Endgame, the culmination of twenty plus movies and the follow up to Infinity War. It should be noted that this will not be the end of the MCU franchise as a whole; of course not. It is the grand finale of the Infinity Stones saga. Five years after the events of the previous film, when Thanos succeeded at wiping out half of all life in the universe, the situation is utterly hopeless. Memorials are made as a feeble attempt by the survivors to remember those that had disappeared, and while it is true that things are looking up, such as with whales returning due to the lack of ships, keep in mind that the Snap wiped out half of ALL life in the universe, so that whole thing with the whales is less optimistic especially if they were in danger of dying out before Thanos halved them. However, when the idea of time travel rears its head, it opens the door for the remaining Avengers that maybe they could undo what the Mad Titan had done.[換行字元][換行字元]The film was surprisingly moving, not to say that any of the MCU films could never be emotional. Even though society tried to continue onward after the Snap, it proves more difficult because they have to try to move on with the knowledge that their friends and loved ones are gone. The remaining heroes also have their own struggles with having to cope with the fact that they lost. But they are also shown to be completely willing to do ""whatever it takes"" to undo the Mad Titan's destruction, even if it may cost them dearly. As for anything else, the action was great as is often the case when it comes to these films, but the third act in particular was probably the best part of the film IMO. How they pulled it off is incredible to say the least. Acting was good for the most part, and many lingering plot threads in the film series and character arcs were fulfilled here.[換行字元][換行字元]The only negatives I can think of is how time travel was implemented in the film. While many guessed that time travel would play a key role in the film due to behind the scene footage of the film, there are times when the logic with how time travel is done in the film gets problematic. Additionally, Chris Hemsworth functions as the comic relief in the film. But, I felt that the recurring jokes surrounding him were a little tired and shortly got irritating. And for all the talk that Marvel did in regards to Captain Marvel, she did not even appear that much in the film. She does appear in two pivotal moments, but is otherwise preoccupied. To me, it sounds as though there were more scenes dedicated to her but were likely scrapped from the final product. Otherwise, greatly enjoyed the film, and I feel that it is a great send off to the Infinity Stones arc. With July comes Spider-Man: Far From Home, which will overall conclude the fourth phase of the MCU. Can't wait to see what else is in store."
5262,"It is awesome, fantastic, but it was not as great as infinity war"
5263,What is this garbage? 3 hours of absolutely nothing but awful dialogue and boring misplaced fight scenes. Must be all the brainwashed Marvel fanboys who gave this movie a top rating...
5264,Honestly the best movie and cinematic experience ever. This is a perfect send off and anyone scoring it less than 10 is just trying to be controversial.
5265,"I dont know how to say butThe movie just perfect, from the story,visual,acting,and the battle are just perfect, this is movie in generation, must watch quckly."
5266,"One of the greatest movies I've ever seen. The plots really stunned me. It's a filled with everything that a movie should have. Great respect to Joe and Anthony and the full credit goes to the father of MCU, Stan Lee 😍😍😍"
5267,Marvel keep improve in all its movie. And this is one of the best films that marvel has ever made
5268,"It's not bad for a comic book to movie film, but, seriously folks, This is a joke. Re-added scenes to ""catch"" Titanic? Get serious! Titanic is an absolute masterpiece compared to this. Too many 'analytic' reviwes already here, so I won't go into details, but this is just nowhere near the hype it got."
5269,"Avengers: End Game is long, boring, and predictable--with an endless amount of fan service. The humor in this movie just doesn't get a laugh. I cannot express how disappointed I am with the conclusion of 10 years of movies. I'm shocked this film is actually getting good reviews. This will be the last Marvel movie I see on opening night. I cannot help but think this is the beginning of the end for the MCU. It was good while it lasted."
5270,"'Avengers: Endgame' is a film that manages to serve the 21 MCU films before it in a way that is almost magical, and near perfect. The film does a wonderful job at tying up and concluding so many storylines that have been present throughout the last 11 years and 22 films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film manages to out-do itself and delivers on absolutely gigantic and epic proportions. While the film isn't perfect and there are some slight gripes and nitpicks I definitely have, it is perfectly satisfying in the way it manages to close itself up. 'Endgame' offers a justifiable conclusion that can best be described as epic."
5271,"I am trying to be honest and being objective as much as I can : this movie is EPIC, I am sure ever single person in the world who has watched it will be pleased and satisfied. It was a complete emotion-packed movie.[換行字元][換行字元]It has a few flaws, I am sure some Marvel fans feel it too, some may be annoyed by the flaws (the directors should have done this, done that, why not this, why not that, minor plot holes, etc) but all was paid off by its EPIC-ness.[換行字元][換行字元]PS : I felt empty after I watched the Endgame, even until I write this review. It is not because I don't like the movie, it is just because I am not sure whether the next MCU saga will be as GREAT and EPIC as this. Good luck for the future MCU !!"
5272,"Infinity war was overall a better movie, but this movie had the disadvantage of being the follow up to that movie. A good chunk of this movie is essentially remembering what happened during infinity war. The struggle against Thanos in this movie... It just isnt done in a satisfying way.[換行字元][換行字元]Before Infinity war came out last year, it was already confirmed there would be another Avengers follow up this year. It was speculated that Endgame was actually going to be called ""Infinity war part 2"". Unfortunately, this is Endgame, but it SHOULD have been Infinity war part 2. I know that is very vague, Im trying to be vague, but essentially because of what happened in Infinity War, it was pretty much impossible to make a sequel which feels like it even is the same story with the same consistency & epic feel. Or at least, that is not what we got.[換行字元][換行字元]Captain Marvel kinda sucks in this movie. She is a boring character with magic powers. Ughhh great. In hindsight, the tease in Infinity war was cool, but it makes it into a big letdown. And this is kind of the story of the whole movie, if Infinity War was the teaser. (Although it isnt quite that bad, this movie is still pretty good, unlike Captain Marvel in it.)"
5273,"It was the movie event of the generation. Despite the relatively slow build up in the first half (as compared to Infinity War), it is worth a watch. Especially because of the end fight sequence, which was epic to its very core. The last thirty minutes es were the best 30 minutes of any movie ever made, let alone superhero movies. The twist and turns along the way, with some truly iconic scenes that no one ever expected, make the movie really entertaining to watch."
5274,"The only problem with the movie is that it's too damn good. It'll take a long time to get over the awesomeness of endgame. Just sit back, relax and enjoy a masterpiece by Russo Bros :)"
5275,"I wasn't huge on the MCU until recently, maybe a year ago. I had seen a few MCU movies but I truly saw the potential of the MCU when I saw ""The Avengers."" This movie blew me away, seeing Ironman, Hulk, Thor, etc. in the same movie was just baffling. That's when my liking of the MCU began, I started watching all of the MCU movies, hoping to get the same amount of excitement The Avengers gave me. I was often disappointed, movies like Ironman 2&3, Thor the Dark World, and Captain America the First Avenger just didn't please me like I wanted them to. Don't get me wrong, there were good movies, I liked movies like Antman, Doctor Strange, and Guardians of the Galaxy, but I didn't consider them incredible or mind blowing. Then came the Captain America sequels, movies that truly blew me away, I consider both of them to be the best in the MCU (they definitely deserve higher praise than Infinity War or Endgame). I went into Avengers Age of Ultron expecting to be blown away, but was severely disappointed, mad even. Then came Infinity War, the movie follow up to one of the most popular comic lines of all time. Although it wasn't very faithful to its comic counterpart, I thought it was a good movie (not as good as Winter Soldier it Civil War, but good). I thought I would like Infinity War more after its sequel came out because this movie was really just a setup for the next movie. My hype was huge for Endgame, the trailer was awesome, and it would complete the Avengers saga. I went into the theater ecstatic, and left kinda confused. I didn't understand, I was waiting for the awesome sequel to Infinity War and after I left I felt like I was still looking. The movie isn't bad by any means, but I feel like it destroyed my dreams. The movie itself has no reason being 3 hours long. Just take out all of the boring dialogue, that will skim down the movie into about 2 hours. Most of the exposition is delivered through dialogue, a lot of boring movies nowadays suffer from the same problem. The pacing is exhaustingly slow, it's just an excuse to draw out the run time. This movie suffers from the same problem many MCU movies suffer from- a lack of focus. I think of the MCU movies I like; Antman is a movie that knows how absurd it is, and it doesn't differ from this viewpoint. It's like the movie Napoleon Dynamite, if they stopped halfway through this movie and had a long, heartfelt talk, that would just be strange and might even ruin the movie. Now, you have a MCU movie which are usually filled with humor and great action, but ever five minutes they stop and have a long, serious conversation. And the humor in this movie completely falls flat, I laughed once- whenever Thor was playing Fortnite, the idea was just so stupid and absurd I couldn't help but laugh. I get it, they tried and give this movie a serious tone, but you can't just abandon this serious tone all the time for the sake of a joke (that will most likely fall flat). Captain America Civil War handled a serious tone very well. Think about Civil War, I guarantee you aren't thinking of a specific joke, you're thinking of a grand fight scene or a philosophical debate between Captain America and Tony Stark. And overall, the main gimmick of the movie the means to which they attempt to get the stones back doesn't make sense, they try and explain it, but even then it was difficult to keep up with (IMO). They could just go back and get more of the resource they need to power the ""you know what."" The only reason for having limited resources is to heighten the stakes. Also, this movie ruined my favorite part of Infinity War- Thanos. He had such a villainous presence and a plan that you could understand, at times his plan didn't even sound that bad. So why.... just why..... why did you have to go and make him a stereotypical, lifeless, one-dimensional villain. The fact they ruined him, infuriates me beyond speech. This movie left such a bad taste in my mouth, and I blame myself for how much I dislike this movie, I gave it so much hype."
5276,This movie engages you for the whole run time and not even once you feel bored
5277,Garbage that fits with today's over blown pc generation of over thinking and numbing lifeless endings. Not a fan of these films and this was the worst considering the waste of talent and plot that just seemed to be about over the top nonsense. The sad thing is how many people fall into the trap of thinking this movie has any validity of reality!!
5278,"I liked it. It could have been better though. There were some parts were I felt unnecessary. There were some unnecessary, forced joked. I thought what they did with Thor was a mistake. In the middle part I felt a little bored. Most people say the ending was epic and satisfying but I disagree to some extent. Don't get me wrong, the ending was very good, but I felt something went wrong there. It could have been a much happier ending I guess."
5279,This movie have fantastic effects and I love its music.
5280,"I really enjoyed the prequel to this waste of my life(Infinity wars), the GOTG crew humour etc made it a fabulous balance.[換行字元][換行字元]This however had no soul, it drifted in and out of morose depression and self pity for the hopeless state everyone was in, this took up a good 2 hours. Then an idiotic and predictable battle and i cheered when i could finally get up and leave. I need to find that glove so i can get 3 hours of my life back. Waste of time."
5281,"This movie tries to give so much to so many, and in my opinion succeeds on a scale we haven't encountered ever before in the mcu. You will laugh, you will cry, and hard-core fans will definitely feel shocked at times. There sure are surprises, that some will love and some will hate. The Russo brothers made sure to change the pace considerably from what we are used to, since this film is about closures and farewells. I'm also fully convinced they did their fanfiction and fanart research to please most viewers with certain outcomes, and ended up presenting us with one fulfilling, tear-jerking three hours long rollercoaster parting gift. So go see this gift, and as we've been told in the trailers, enjoy the ride."
5282,"Objectively, if this movie is produced by any other studio no matter in which country,it won't get a score of 10. But the thing is I can never be rational about MARVEL. Avengers:Endgame indeed give MARVEL's as well as my last 11 years a satisfying ending.This movie is a milestone in the film industry, I doubt if we'll be able to see another movie like this any time sooner, so I really suggest that people,especially MARVEL fans enjoy this movie to the fullest for the highly likely vaccany of this type of film in the next decade or even decades.[換行字元][換行字元]In Avengers:Endgame, we waved goodbye to some of our favorite chracters and we may never see them in MCU again. But one thing I do know is that the examples these heroes set for us and their spirits will never die, and their successors will bring us more surprises.[換行字元][換行字元]I will never forget the eleven years in which in grew up with MCU ,and I hope it'll always be with me in the future.[換行字元][換行字元]As for MARVEL and all the superheroes that have left us ,love you 3000 times until eternity"
5283,"I personally feel this is by far the movie I've ever seen. I cried, I laughed, I got chills, I was on the edge of my seat, I said awwwww... What more do you want from this awesome emotional roller coaster. Honestly if you don't feel at least one emotion from this film you might be dead inside or not have a soul, or suffer from brain damage.. Also if you are the type to give this movie a 1 out of 10 you're a prude and should be ashamed of yourself. Everyone wants to be a critic but few have an open heart, mind and integrity. I say this because I value a movie on obviously it's believability, it's emotional manipulation, quality of imagery, and having a concrete concise story. This movie has all those qualities in spades. Enjoy the movie."
5284,"Though it may have too much humour for a final, emotional thrill ride, ENDGAME is the closing that everyone was waiting for and needed. It has scenes that will shock and emotionally move long time fans and boasts heart stopping action sequences."
5285,"When you have watched YouTube videos from looper which explains the reasoning behind the individual characters endings and also the number of links to the previous films, do you really realize this was a real piece of art and one that may never be replicated again. What a way to end 22 films but also start a new platform for many others.....plus Disney now owns the rights to x-men and the avengers!!!!!!"
5286,Long movie. It was good but not great unless your under 25
5287,I seen this in the theaters and let me tell you this was the most mixed emotion movie ever this movie had me crying especially at the end and there were some parts that were heart raceing and another part were it was funny so all around i supper recommend to watch this movie it will have you in love it has alot of action
5288,"What a movie!!!..im still thinking about it after 12 hours...awesome direction..great acting from everyone..fun,intense,sad..the ending is fantastic..you have to watch it..i love all the MCU movies and this is one of the best...surely in the top 5..maybe better than infinity war"
5289,"This movie is near perfect. It doesn't work without the MCU films that came before it, but if you've seen them all, WOW. packs a serious emotional punch. Fun, funny, sad, I got all the feels."
5290,"First off, I would like to get somethings off my chest. I'll admit, in terms of a pure film I feel that Infinity War was better as a whole than Endgame. I found Endgame to be quite predictable throughout and I felt that it suffered more with Marvel's usual pacing issues more so than IW. While enjoyable, I felt that this film pushed the comedic tones a little bit too much for my taste compared to the previous film and disrupted the overall balance.[換行字元][換行字元]However, this film still defied my already sky high expectations. Endgame did exactly what the title said.. it was the Endgame and boy was it a sight to behold. From the bombastic fight scenes and the intersecting complexities between each character, the film never ceased to excite. In many ways, what Endgame did right was it took the spectacle that was Infinity War and somehow took it to an even bigger notch. I found the film to be overall a lot more memorable than its previous counterpart. Throughout its 3 hour run time (which honestly didn't even feel like it, time felt like a breeze inside the theater), I felt that the film as a whole was much more compelling and contained more scenes that constantly put me in the edge.Such a statement is quite daring to make, but I felt that Endgame did an absolutely remarkable job in leaving so much distinct and vivid imagery. A film of this magnitude is meant to be a spectacle, an emotional joyride, and a bonafide table-setter all bundled into one roller coaster of a ride and such expectation was met tenfold.[換行字元][換行字元]What I also loved about Endgame was that it beautifully ended so many prominent character arcs, while also establishing the foundations for the new era of Marvel films. I especially loved all the subtle and not so subtle callbacks to the past films in the series, which is quite a treat for long time fans like me. These are not the easiest to achieve in film, but the Russo Brothers did an amazing job in piecing 11 years of cinema history in order to project the absolute perfect finale to one of the most iconic franchises in the history of cinema.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, it's not a perfect film by any stretch but it's impossible not to give it a 10/10. Endgame is supposed to tie up all the loose ends and questions from the 23 other movies in the MCU, which it accomplishes beautifully. It isn't as fine polished and clean as IW, but it didn't need to be. Endgame set out to do the job and it passed with an array of flying colors. To all the twist and turns throughout the 11 years since the MCU was firmly described, I can easily say that one of the most epic nights of my life. Fans old and new fans can easily appreciate how epic of a film this is. Marvel knew what was needed to be done in terms of making the infinity saga happen and it was absolutely worth the wait. This era of the MCU is going to be surely missed and I cannot thank Marvel Studios enough for a hell of a ride. This might be the Endgame, but it has and will continue to be worth every second of anyone's time."
5291,Best marvel film yet as simple as that. Long film but didnt seem it at the time of watching gripped all the way through. Hoping the next phrase is as good as the last. Looking forward to next one.
5292,It's amazing. I have no words to describe this movie. All heroes together to fight to the end it's beautiful to see.
5293,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was great. There were some very epic moments and some very sad moments. However, it was way too long. Without getting into spoilers, I found myself pretty bored within the first hour.[換行字元][換行字元]80% of EndGame was really just a fan service/tribute to the MCU fans who watched all the previous MCU titles (most of which I saw). Even after the ~30 mins climatic battle (which was the best part of the film), however, the movie somehow continues to drag itself on again.[換行字元][換行字元]I also felt there were some plot holes in the story/concepts; I had trouble understanding how it all worked.[換行字元][換行字元]The humor was alright, but it is of typical MCU-grade comedy. Again, some jokes were good, while other jokes were just dragged on or plain cheesy.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall I liked Infinity War better"
5294,"This movie was good for an ending of a franchise but dont think it lives up to the hype, I found it boring and hard to keep me watching."
5295,"They couldn't have done a better job with this movie. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll love all the easter eggs"
5296,I was bored in the first 2 hours. Let down from my own expectation.
5297,"There were elements where this film moved a bit slower than it maybe should have, but in a way, it helped you take a deep breath before you headed into the storm that was the final few scenes. I laughed, I cried, and then I cried some more before saying goodbye to some of the characters who had been with me for over ten years. All I can say is thank you to these wonderful movies for being everything they were and everything they will always be."
5298,This is the best superhero movie in my lifetime. I can't imagine how Marvel or any other film outfit top this.
5299,"Many fans will watch this movie one time... But not us[換行字元][換行字元]That's the way how marvel deals with their fans[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you, no any movie has the same quality such with the same actors as marvel[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame... Yes.... This is the end thank you"
5300,"The wrap-up to last's year Infinity War is a satisfying wellspring of closure to many of our Marvel faves as the battle against Thanos & his minions to save the universe & perhaps restore the lost lives that were disappeared when the snap heard around the universe was instituted. Not going into the outcomes of some characters or mucking about in spoilers, this effort by the Russo brothers is gargantuan in scope & intent as multiple storylines through 22 separate films comes to a head. Whether you come from your screening satisfied or frustrated, you must give heed to the Herculean effort attempted & accomplished. This is surely a film for the ages."
5301,"Don't know what all the hype was about! The film is one hour too long because there just wasn't enough action. The Hulk was not so ""Incredible"" & Thor was not much of a ""God"" I was rather perplexed by how underutilised some of the characters were given the powers they have. The ending had potential, but unfortunately it failed to deliver. It's good but not great."
5302,If you're marvel fan ignore rating and watch this asap And i love this movie 3000
5303,FAVORITE MCU FILM OF ALL TIME. The greatest story arc and character development in a film. Masterfully done.
5304,"... so don't.[換行字元][換行字元]It's a time travel jumble that never settles into a solid theory of time, predestination, or the multiverse theory. Or more speficially, it tells you its theory and then spends the next couple of hours breaking it over and over. If you try to work it out, side effects may include headache, nosebleed, and a desire to have a bit of a lie down. That said, it's emotionally perfect as the ending of the whole series thus far. The 22 film + shorts + tv-shows-if-you-like-that-kind-of-thing has a definitive end as well as the promise of a new day just ahead. In the shared-universe age of films, this is the first time I've felt like I was seeing a ""series finale"" the way one would with a long-running TV series. Now to hope that what lies ahead isn't a bunch of films that feel like ""After MASH"", trying to keep the IP alive when all of the interesting characters/actors have shuffled off down the road."
5305,Wow! This movie will blow you away. You will feel every human emotion in this movie. It's a must watch!
5306,The greatest movie of this decade every scenes is mind blowing there r emotional scenes to one of the best fight scenes Its just 3 hours of Greatness
5307,Have to say the best film I have ever seen. If you are prone to needing toilet breaks in the cinema wear a nappy!! As you cannot leave your seat watching it. Russo brothers thank you for delivering in my eyes a truly amazing experience and I have never had my emotions on such a rollercoaster ride watching a film. This reminds me of what a cinema experience should be as knew not much about what will happen and trailers didn't reveal the good bits. It was an epic and enjoyable film no need to stay for post credits either as there is none
5308,"Never have I felt this emotinal in a comicbook movie since Logan, never have I felt this emotinal to for a comicbook movie performance since Hugh Jackman in Logan; RDJ deserves an Oscar nom for what he did in the movie, in fact all the actors in the film especially the original 6, deliver their best performance in the MCU and just one of their best performances in general. Chris Evans gives a emotinally powerful performance that is aided by an equally emotinal and poetic arc and would too be behind him getting a nomimation, Scarlett Johansson and Jermey Renner deliver emotinal performances (Johansson gets two very powerful scenes, and Renner goes to a dark place in the movie which leads to a great one-shot action scene). Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo are also excellent, especially the former who delivers a humorous but also emotinal all-around well-rounded performance (his arc is definitely not all jokes about a new physique he has like many are saying, he actually gets some genuince scenes and grows). Paul Rudd also is very funny as always but also has a chance to show more of his serious, genuine side in a very heartwarming scene early in the film. The movie's first act is very slow and I very much mean that as a postive because it displays some of the best character work I've seen in comicbook movie it's that good! Infinty War/Endgame will be two generational events that'll be talked about for years and years to come what these two movies done,espically Endgame in terms of wrapping the story of the original heroes, can't be unstated. Infinity War gave us the follblown action cosmic adventure that had what now is becoming the Darth Vader of our generation as the protagonist with a bold ending; many kids will tell their kids about how frightening Thanos was when they saw him (and even how traumatizing). Endgame is the emotinal character-driven film that wraps a story of characters that we followed and grew with for 11 years. Thank You Marvel, Kevin Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Russos, and Markus and McFeely for this unforgettable experince!"
5309,"No more words needed^, however to avoid the review being too short I'll give some.[換行字元][換行字元]Always expected it to be good however was semi-expecting to be a little disappointed through plot holes etc. Ultimately though it exceeded my already sky high expectations."
5310,"First off, now this is important: THERE ARE NO END CREDIT SCENES, so you don't have to stay after the movie. With that out of the way, let's get to the review. I gotta say, anyone saying this movie was way too predictable, just... Just don't listen to them. Personally, I was surprised how they wrapped up endgame and very pleased with it too. Also, the depth of the characters. Man, that's what carries this movie more than anything. They manage to include everyone's stories and therefore make it easy for the audience to relate to each character, and that for me was a huge part of this movie's success. Acting, CGI, music etc. was on point, and tbh the only thing that bothered me in the movie was the political correctness, even though it was only for a few scenes. To me, these movies shouldn't be sending messages of any kind. It's a fictional world, so why should it be sending political messages to our actual world? Anyway, it is only for a few scenes, and it doesn't take away the class of the movie. At the end of the day, of course I think you should go watch it in the cinema, as I do think it is one of those movies that are far better on the big screen. A word of advice tho, please watch all the previous MCU movies, as there are manyyyyyy references to earlier movies, and it just is a lot of fun to understand them throughout the movie. Enjoy!"
5311,This was an EPIC and FUNNY movie! The ending was so cool and emotional.
5312,"Best movie ever to watch, Very emotional, powerful, satisfying"
5313,This is how you to end a series an epic ending perfect I cried so much
5314,"The movie is amazing. I never thought they would ve able to surpass their own amazing job with Infinity War but they did. Where the movie truly shine is in its third act, it is just beautiful. I felt like a little kid watching the whole thing. Simply astonishing."
5315,"Boring characters, boring dialogue, good plot. Very overly dramatic, and also a lot of annoying product placement."
5316,"The usual.[換行字元][換行字元]Was hoping for the more thrills and drama.[換行字元][換行字元]Too predictable and not creative.[換行字元][換行字元]Lots of hype, but not the best action movie. Yes, there were lots of actions."
5317,I would have tweaked little things here and there but overall this film can only be described as Phenomenal.
5318,Just go watch the film you will understand after that
5319,Perfect ending but still bit emotional. I would say 11/10..must watch it. Hats off RDJr.
5320,"When I walked out of the theatre I was really pleased with what I had seen( not a 10/10, but a good 9). But the more I thought about it the more weak points I could spot. There were some scenes that made me feel very angry, like all the stuff they have done to my favourite hero Thor. It was funny at first but later it just got on my nerves and made me (and all other fans of him) aggressive. There were also some scenes where the writers just found conclusion that were too easy compared to the problems that had been there. The movie also had some holes in its plot and things that just didn't seem very logic. But the start was great and all in all Marvel delivered very well. All in all it was a very good and enjoyable movie with some very emotional moments."
5321,What a great way to end a 11 years thank you marvel for this masterpiece
5322,"If you are a Marvel Fan and has watched all the marvel movies since Iron Man (2008) then this movie will be surely an emotional Ride for you. The direction of this movie is just brilliant. The action, the screenplay, the ending is top notch. A movie just can't get better than this!"
5323,"The movie was very fitting for the ending of a phenomenal 10 years MCU run. But I must admit that I didn't like the ending. The ending didn't leave me happy. My favorite character is Iron Man and like always Iron Man is forever the hero. However, he was the hero with a sad ending. 🙁 I am unable to watch this a second time."
5324,"No spoilers.[換行字元][換行字元]This film is genuinely incredible, absolutely perfect end to the chapter. The movie ties up loose ends you don't even know are loose, it's just fantastic. Really couldn't rate this film any higher, an emotional range as broad as you'd expect from Marvel. . Laughter, tears, and elation all in a matter of minutes. Go watch it!"
5325,"Amazing how Marvel has created this cinematic universe. So many good stories, all connected. This movie was long but great to watch."
5326,"The connections that we have made with these characters all these years comes full circle in this movie and it is pulled off in an incredible, emotional, epic finale"
5327,"After Infinity War I was worried about how Endgame would take the second half after the snap and I loved it. It was happy, it was sad, I laughed and I cried and I felt the characters and their stories went exactly where they needed to to. Bravo, Marvel!!"
5328,Incredible. Worth all three hours you are sitting there. Fabulous way to end the infinity saga.
5329,"It's hard to believe that after 22 movies and 11 years that Endgame wraps up what is now known as ""the Infinity Saga"". Marvel does not disappoint with Endgame.[換行字元][換行字元]While it does start out pretty slow, it all builds to the climatic final battle between the heroes and Thanos. The battle is reminiscent of those in the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit trilogies: massive scale, good vs evil, whatever it takes.[換行字元][換行字元]It's not what we necessarily expected, but it's what we deserved.

5330,"The visual spectacle that has dominated 2019 thus far is truly a sight to see. For long time Marvel fans this will serve as a truly satisfying ending to the Infinity Arc. Aside from the fact that at times the story feels cumbersome in thought and motivation in its direction, often leaving the viewer confused. Nonetheless, it maintains its ability to entertain the viewer through the full three hours of playtime."

Arcs for Captain America and Iron Man feel thoroughly earned. There are a lot of surprises in the movie and most feel earned and well-developed.

Parts of the movie are much darker than I thought however, the tone remains consistent throughout.[換行字元][換行字元]Cons: They do something with Thanos towards the end that erases what happens in Infinity War which undercuts the ""win"" against him in the movie. Most of the messy stuff comes into play with Thor and a spoiler ""thing"" which I will not discuss. The scenes with Thor were supposed to be funny, you know like marvel movies funny, BUT I was not laughing at all. It felt so completely out of place and out of character. It is a horrible direction that the directors decided to take this character, who absolutely shined in Infinity War. Talking of weird directions, a character in Endgame makes a huge decision off-screen that should have been shown on-screen.

It had its own flaws and I didn't get 1 or 2 answers i was looking in this movie but in the end I was satisfied, the second half went on another level and some set pieces will be remembered for years to come. Once in a decade a movie in this genre comes who defines the genre, the previous 10 years was The Dark Knight from this year onwards it would be Endgame."

Quite frankly I would mix the two up until I started watching the movies more and actually understanding what the hype for these movies was all about. My friend is really into these type of movies and for their birthday I decided I would ""take"" (can't drive it almost) them to see Avengers: endgame. On that note that meant I would have had to seen at least a couple of the movies so during the past couple months before this movie came out, I let them choose the movies they wanted to watch (also because I really don't care what movie we watch, I just enjoy spending time with them). 99% the movies chosen were anything marvel so I've grew quite fond of some characters over time. In saying I told them to drive to the theaters cause they asked me where I had wanted to go and then there we were watching the movie. It was a movie that was mixed with comedy, tragedy, and happiness. The actors really did a great job playing their role in the film but I do also give a shout-out to the directors and everyone else that made the movie possible."

5345,Thank you everyone that played a role in this movie production! The best in our time! #WhateverItTakes

It's actually one of the weakest mcu movies. maybe even worse than black panther and spiderman. and those 2 were really bad.[換行字元][換行字元]so basically, a rat saved the day. Not Hulk, not tony stark but a rat. oh, and time travel. it's like they wrote the scenario in 1 day, in rehab.[換行字元][換行字元]It's a pitty that after Infinity War, which was awesome, we got this dissapointing finale.[換行字元][換行字元]9 stars? lol."
5347,PERFECTION ! JUST ONLY PERFECTION ! 11 years 22 movies 1 marvelous story with a perfect ending movie.
5348,GREATEST SUPERHERO EVER F ALL TIME!!!!!! It doesn't disappoint!!!!!! Worth the HYPE!!!!!!
5349,"It's long winded...easily could be half the 3 hours.... Superhero movies are about battles and heroes...not crying and moaning. Watching iron Man wimper off was such a let down. After watching every avenger movie, I am so disappointed. Only 1 good battle, and it's over too quickly. So so so disappointed...I'd take any other avenger movie over this one."
5350,"Watched to see why so much hype. Audiences hear the hype and lose their minds. So dull. Downey is as always, or at least used to be, enigmatic. The idiocy of the script made me realise the viewers that like this drivel like nothing more than cult like worship of actors names, fictional characters and nothing else. Last one was good but this one was lamer than the new Hulk. Absolutely nothing to gain from watching this Disney reprise to a soy latte drinking generation. GOTG 1 or 2 was at least funny but this was just plain dull scenes welded together like a very expensive TV series. Petty in every way except the budget."
5351,"An excellent 'end' to this saga. It's been many time since the first movie, Iron man, and they couldn't give us a better film to remember every single movie. An excellent villain, and of course incredible Avengers."
5352,"It Is the best suprerhero movie till date . The Story , action , emotions keeps you hold your breath. Total entertainment"
5353,"Good direction, flight sequence at the end is incredible. Just an amazing movie."
5354,"After watching Infinity War, I could not wait for this one. But as the time passed, I felt that End Game would not surpass Infinity War's awesomeness. But now that I have watched it, my advice to everyone is keep your expectations as high as possible, and still it would surpass all your expectations. It truly justifies all the 22 movies and please watch them all before watching this one. Stay away from spoilers. You will laugh and definitely cry multiple times."
5355,The end of a long adventure. my expectation for this movie was too much but the movie was bad for an hour and and some of the characters I expected were bad but the rest of the film made me forget them.
5356,I did fins thia movie highly unrealistic. There is no chance this could happen i the real life!
5357,What an epic end to the saga. I stopped eating my popcorn halfway and forgot I had a drink too. It's just that good.
5358,"No spoilers here. 22 movies, 11 years, and multiple story arcs to tie together. A MASSIVE and record breaking task. Not only that, but I was expecting a lot and got MORE than what I expected. Infinity war was incomplete (on purpose). Unfortunately it just didn't feel like a complete story. This movie is a complete story in and of itself, and it ties in well. More action, more acting, good humor, and TIME TRAVEL!! Also, no credit scenes. This is the end of the current Avengers saga as we know it. Expect teasers for the next team, but don't expect any hints of the next saga's story."
5359,I'm just speechless.....................................
5360,"It seems like just yesterday that Tony Stark built his suit in the desert caves of Afghanistan - an experience that set into motion an incredible chain reaction that forever changed superhero cinematic history. 11 years and 21 movies later, fans finally got the finale they deserved in 'Avengers: Endgame.'[換行字元][換行字元]The Russo brothers already proved their abilities to craft masterpieces that balanced character development with humor and the sleek action sequences that are expected in the Marvel Comic Universe, most recently delivering the critically acclaimed 'Avengers: Infinity War.' In 'Endgame,' they again exceed expectations, as the film is filled with more easter eggs than most kids' Easter baskets - clear signs of appreciation for the fans. Sure, the film carries an ultra-long runtime (at 181 minutes), but this length is needed in order to tie up the multiple storylines, given the number of superheroes who must squeeze in some screen time in this extravaganza. To this point, it's rewarding to see so many avengers who haven't traditionally been given the spotlight in previous films the chance to shine. And some give unexpectedly memorable performances (here's looking at you, Wanda).[換行字元][換行字元]As a whole, 'Endgame' is not quite on the level of 'Infinity War.' Despite the third act being the most satisfying, emotionally-charged segment in the entire franchise, the overall product doesn't quite have the same lustre as its predecessor. It's the 'Return of the Jedi' to 'Infinity War's 'Empire Strikes Back.' Still, there is nothing really worth criticizing about 'Endgame,' aside from a few plot holes and the fact that its existence means many people's childhoods/young adulthoods are coming to an end.[換行字元][換行字元]Throughout the laughs, the gasps, the tears, the smiles, 'Avengers Endgame' proves to be the thank-you note that fans didn't even realize they'd be getting. Stan Lee would certainly be proud."
5361,"3 hours of absolute drag, cheesy predictable ending and so many God damn plotholes the entire time travel bs wack as hell"
5362,"I just love this movie. Specially the climax, seriously one of the best climax I have ever seen."
5363,"Marvel just continues to surprise us with their movies this is definitely a step up from Avengers Infinity War. It really has it all, action, emotions, drama, sadness, humour and most of all, some real 'Hell yea!' moments for some of your favorite characters."
5364,"Nothing infuriates me more than a time travel theme in a movie where it doesn't belong. Oh the main character dies...boom time travel fixes it. Want to rewrite an old franchise....mmm time travel. Out of ideas of what to write about, time travel. There are some movies that do it well and others that fall flat, unfortunately this one fall flat for me. I was a HUGE fan of the original comic story this was loosely based off of. There were so many disappointments in this I don't even know where to start.[換行字元][換行字元]CGI sucks, unless you are pairing it on top of live actors or making it seem like it has substance, 2 cgi characters fighting is like watching 2 clouds smash together. There is no weight to the characters... literally.[換行字元][換行字元]The humor choices were lame, why strip away what makes the hulk the hulk. I wanna see hulk rage and smash everything in his path. He is supposed to be a barely contained, controllable character. In this movie they completely neutered him. They did almost the same thing with Thor. I get they wanted to show he has been through the ringer but it was a poor way to do it. Although he at least fights in the movie so he isn't as neutered as the hulk.[換行字元][換行字元]The women power scene I found was so forced and felt like pandering to the highest level that I felt it took away from empowering women instead. I am all for strong women characters but this was so forced it almost felt icky to watch not to mention begs the question.... did all the women plan this out ahead of time, cuz in a crazy battle like that it seems unlikely they would all happen to be in the same spot.[換行字元][換行字元]Did I mention how weak sauce I think time travel themes are?[換行字元][換行字元]Out of all the Marvel movies this one ranks middle bottom.

5365,I would agree with critics saying its a bit too hyped and overrated movie.Doesnt live upto my expectations. Sorry
5366,"I'm speechless, no words can describe what I feel right after seen this movie. I really hope that marval will keep this level moving forward"
5367,Even though the final battle in endgame was outstanding they focused too much on the battle and not the rest the film. This unfortunately for me ruined the film and I hoped there would of been a better finale considering this was the climax film for the avengers series after a decade of mcu films![換行字元][換行字元]ARCHIE DEE
5368,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.[換行字元][換行字元]On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.[換行字元][換行字元]Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.[換行字元][換行字元]Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10"
5369,"Avengers: Endgame[換行字元][換行字元]Russo Brothers docks the universe in one colossal stage where our mighty heroes dances the dance of their life, it is extremely well choreographed. Never has this ever pulled off at such scale, claims Marvel, and Feige proves it, by swooping in every last drop of blood shed in this war. But mind you, it is unlike Infinity War, it never gets too much. There is a certain amount of linearity in their narration that is more focused and polished than the previous installment. It is the ultimate heist, in a sense that it is as big an ambition as the cast is. And so is the storytelling, as rich as the banner goes, the usual baggage of levity that Marvel often failed to own it, comes in natural in here.[換行字元][換行字元]Split into three acts, this wallop of emotional drama is not the tease for the game but the journey, that Robert Downey Jr. quotes to be proud of. The world of Russo Brothers, is perfectly balanced as Josh Brolin, wanted it to be. What could have been precarious is somehow its best asset, the film is obvious or even obliged to connect the dots. And as much as you feel overridden in this ride, it never grows dull; this overwhelming experience is plastered across the screen for three straight hours that is ought to make the fans giddy up for more.[換行字元][換行字元]What has been fascinating, is to see, not Thanos turned into a mere pawn of the game, his malleable philosophy is still threatening to the leftover superheroes. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the screenwriters, are free from the stereotypical MCU formulaic structure, it doesn't tap on- a joke, an emotional punch and an actual punch- to the safe beat, they have deconstructed their rhythm for the Endgame, tears are expected, satisfaction; a surprise package."
5370,"From my experience watching Endgame, the variance in storyline, CGI, stellar acting performances and interesting cinematography kept me from checking the time even once. A feat which for me is brand new for a film this long![換行字元][換行字元]I'm a big fan of LOTR: Return of the King(3h 21min) for example, however Endgame somehow manages to put time on hold as you focus more on catching your breath between scenes. I'm still surprised and impressed by such a high standard of directing from the Russo brothers, in my opinion they absolutely nailed the pacing on this one.[換行字元][換行字元]It will toy with your emotions, keep you invested and leave you satisfied.[換行字元][換行字元]To me, this is a film raising the standard of entertainment at its finest.[換行字元][換行字元]Can't recommend it enough.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you Russos!"
5371,"I've been a fan of superheroes since I was little kid. When Iron Man was out, I couldn't believe it, it was so good. But, I completely fell in love with the idea of the MCU when I watched Captain America: The First Avenger. Here we are, 10 years later, 10 years loving fictional characters, loving the actors, loving the movies, to have it ending like... well this.[換行字元][換行字元]I think they had a great idea, a great way of saying goodbye to the most beloved characters, but I think the movie fell short. I was more emotional during the ending credits than the whole movie. I felt like I needed more, like there was many things left unsaid. Maybe I'll love it the second time I watched it? I don't know honestly, for now, I am a bit disappointed with this one."
5372,I mean i can't even talk about what just i saw there thank you Marvel.
5373,"If you saw Infinity War, I think you knew where the overall arc of this would go. I went into Endgame a little arrogant, thinking I knew the whole plot. But one of the big surprises that this movie drops is that it constantly subverts expectations. If you've managed to avoid spoilers, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with where Endgame goes. What I thought would take the whole movie is done and fully explored in the first 15 minutes. This is absolutely a good thing, superhero movies are always at their best when they're experimental and unafraid of abandoning the formula. While I can't say it completely split off from what was expected, I was excited with every turn or twist in the narrative and I have to applaud the creative team for not just retreading the formula and delivering something off-kilter, at least for the MCU.[換行字元][換行字元]Unless you aren't familiar with the marketing, Endgame largely centres around time travel and I was also impressed that they balanced this concept while running through the emotional gauntlet. Most time travel stories come in 2 varieties, the goofy comedies (I would put the Back to the Future franchise, Happy Death Day, Hot Tub Time Machine etc.) or in the completely serious (11/22/63, the Butterfly Effect, The Time Machine). Endgame puts a spin on it where the stakes are very real but you get the classic humour from the best MCU entries. Its a fine line to walk but Endgame does it as an art form, the movie is both very funny and at other points heartbreaking. Its harder to accomplish than you think (even in a normal movie as opposed to this gigantic franchise picture) but they got it done. They also handled the time travel aspect well, some movies fall all over themselves trying to explain how time travel could exist but this was a situation where other than some technobabble, they add a few lines as a catch all and then they move on. Maybe that won't be good enough for some but I just accepted it and kept going.[換行字元][換行字元]With so many movies and so many characters to include, doing them all justice and giving everyone ample screen time would have been impossible. But another highlight of Endgame was that they gave all the original players (Ironman, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye) a side story or mini-arc that was both respectful and added to their respective stories. Its amazing that I can say that just thinking about it now and I tip my hat to them again. I did see this with a group of diehard MCU friends and one of them was upset with how Thor was presented in this move, so it may not be flawless for the whole contingent of fans. But I didn't hear many false notes played and every bit flowed together well. I was also pleasantly surprised that Nebula (played by the wonderful Karen Gillian) got a satisfying amount of screen time that payed off well, it mirrored Gamora's (Zoe Saldana) subplot in Infinity War. The only one who I was disappointed in was our villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) who was a much more interesting character in Infinity War. You could relate to his thought process and identify with him, I feel like the support he got threw Disney off and they made him more of a sadistic jerk in this one to get the desired reaction.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie and this franchise features the cream of the crop with the A-list of Hollywood actors and actresses. They all excel together and apart and there isn't a weak performance in the group. This shouldn't be news, with a cast of this calibre, there wasn't even a chance that there would be a weak spot. Some people get more to do than others (I doubt you're going to see this for Don Cheadle's inclusion but if you love War Machine for example, he's not a major player in the action) but everyone does top notch work and I expected nothing less.[換行字元][換行字元]There's so much good here that it feels weird to say anything negative. The only thing that really caught my attention is that after the first 15 minutes, the rest of the first hour drags compared to the rest of the movie. It's not uninteresting or boring but it feels like when you're cranking your engine to start your car, you're waiting on pins and needles for the movie to really hit its stride. It gets there and it does its job incredibly but you are waiting for it to fire up for a little while. The other note I would give is that with the inclusion of so many characters, some of the appearances are a little one note. Ant-Man is there to largely dump exposition and pump up Cap and Carol Danvers is in the movie way less than what you would expect (I was in the camp that enjoyed Captain Marvel, if you didn't, this may not be such a bad thing). But these are very minor issues in a movie that scores at least 9/10 things right.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame will be so many different things to so many MCU fans, whether you see it as a kick @$$ blockbuster, the culmination of the MCU to this point, the final farewell to some of your favourite MCU originals or maybe the best action movie you'll see this year. I think it does about as good of a job as you can expect (if you're even a casual Marvel fan, you're going to dig this) with the pressure, the expectations and the weight of all the success the franchise has had dominating the box office for over a decade. There are points of the movie that are slow and not as interesting but when Endgame kicks into gear, it flies down the road. I still slightly prefer Infinity War but its a 1A) to 1B) comparison as opposed to one being a 10 and the other being a 7. Unless you're suffering from serious superhero fatigue (which I wouldn't blame you for) or just dead set against the MCU, you're going to really enjoy this movie. Endgame is a 9.5/10 that checks all the boxes and caps the MCU to this point in a fun, touching and above all exciting 3 hours at the theatre."
5374,"I have seen it twice already! It is the perfect ending for the stories of the original Avengers. The Russo Brothers have pulled off another incomparable movie! #GOATs I literally felt every emotion possible in this movie, many of which at the same time! I laughed, I cried, I was completely content with every aspect of this movie. I literally got my in my car afterwards and just broke down crying with all these emotions swirling around! I could only get one word out at a time for a straight 30min: ""Perfect"" Thus, I would say it is perfect."
5375,This movie was all and more. It was a long movie but I never got bored. Thought things were gonna go one way and it went totally different. I will say the very end let you know what movies where coming back and hat characters wouldn't be returning. It also lets you wonder if maybe things are how they looked. I want to go see it again
5376,Each nd every character has been handled so efficiently perfectly balanced!!! Despite being 3 hours long it keeps us on edge of our seats
5377,"It was quite a Wilde ride!!! Lovely in every single aspect including the music by silvestri, acting by every major character, huge thumbs up to Scarlet.[換行字元][換行字元]I believe this was the perfect conclusion to 11 years of success"
5378,"If you see the whole adventure, we must admit MCU travel was really really best and complex, no alternative could cover it.

Avengers Infinity War 4. Black Panther 5. Captain America The Winter Soldier"
5379,"It is everything I wanted it to be and more. You will not be disappointed, regardless of what the negative/lower reviews have to say here. Thank you and congratulations to all who had a hand in making it, well done!"
5380,There are not enough words to describe the last Avengers.A movie that comes out once in a generation.EPIC
5381,"And i did like the previous ones. The first part was also not so good but this one was empty .... i totally don't understand why many people did like it. The aspects i usually like in this series is the humor and fun. This one didn't have almost any jokes and the storyline, is (as usual) pretty idiotic. There was not even any sophistication in the plot, just ... three hours of nothing. i don't rate it with 1/10 just because there were a few well done landscape shots...[換行字元][換行字元]Come on, earth, stop spinning... i want to get off..."
5382,"This movie has all the ingredients you look for in a cinema experience. From the story, to the characters we've come to love, the top-not acting, the emotion/action displayed and the closing of one of the greatest action ensemble journey we've seen in our lifetime. Not any movie can really be perfect, however with Endgame, it has everything you could want and then some! Highly recommend watching this!"
5383,WARNING! There is no after credits scene And i'm a bit disappointed they under powerd Thor
5384,"Worst movie i saw this year boring mess,plot holes,too cheesy,bad writing"
5385,"When I saw Infinity wars I knew the next movie will deal with unsnaping and the defeat of Thanos. After a year of waiting I saw the movie like everybody else. The sense of loss and of losing someone is tremendous both aspects are very different from comic books storylines, but for a movie it is important. In this movie the action, pace, and exuberance of supers is very less and slow. The concentration was given to human emotions, hopelessness and consequent coping to hard reality. However, few things I would avoided in scripting would the way in which they solved the problem and the credibility of the description of such powerful stones. Mysterious soul stone, its layer, reason for sacrifice all has meaning except for the convenience of the plot. Time stone description in Dr.Strange has no role either. This entire movie fooled everyone by think stones have tremendous possibilities but it was just meant for the plot. That was disappointing. However it is master piece considering the way in which it was made. If I had to analyze and nitpick all the plot holes it would be full of spoilers. So I would say watch the movie and enjoy the epic conclusions."
5386,"I think infinity war is a very good movie (10/10), and personally I expected a much more epic experience. But it was not. Maybe it's because of my expectation, but in my view, it wasn't serious and it has made a joke from itself. I'm so disappointed."
5387,"Headline says it all, one of the best movies ever made. The culmination of the Infinity Saga and the storyline for so many characters. The best conclusion since The Return of the King."
5388,"The movie gave us everything we wanted.. No doubt, this is the best movie of the century"
5389,"Love adventure, superheroes and Marvel, but this movie was awful and completely booring. This should have been made into a 15 minute ending of the previous movie. Don't understand who this appeals to. We were a mixed gender group and all of us just waited for it to finally end. Don't except anything exciting or interesting. The plot is easy to see through and they fail miserably to create any emotional connection with the audience."
5390,"This movie was mind blowing. I was expecting something great, but this was even better. All parts of this movie were made so perfectly it awed me. This movie is a must see whether you are a Marvel fan or not"
5391,"The End game gave me a lot of feelings. Joy,fear,excitement and sadness. In this movie I cried a lot. Because if you are a fan since 2008 it's kinda hard to see this movie. Besides of all that this movie was very fun. Especially Thor delivers the best jokes. You also gonna see things that will surprise you. You are going to say ""Holly sh** this actually happened"". But trust me you will go to the theater happy and excited and you are going to live happy and sad. But this movie it's promising it gives you what you want and even more. Believe me on that. I hope I didn't spoil anything for you I don't want to spoil anything because this movie is the greatest superheroe film ever. And as always stay a true fan."
5392,"In Russia, the Avengers showed a delay from the whole world, as a result of which we were attacked by spoilers. Very much what happened. Next time I will ask the authors of such films to either refuse to show your films in Russia at all, or to show them along with the world premiere of the day. And Russia is a shame that they postponed the film."
5393,What more do I need to say??? It's freakin endgame and its a masterpiece
5394,"Does this movie have loopholes, of course it does - nothing is perfect but you tend to ignore them and focus on the pure joy and excitement you get from watching this movie. So many emotions and how they connected their very first movie to the last (no spoilers) - it was sheer brilliance.[換行字元][換行字元]A job very very well done. Didn't disappoint."
5395,"Avengers Endgame for me, was good but not so good, it was fun but not so fun, it was exciting but not so exiting, it was emotional but just a little bit. From the get go it tries to establish things that are confusing. For me it broke the #1 code that made Marval movie great - don't break your own fictional universe's rules. Endgame breaks quite a few rules and I ended up at the finale waiting for explanation which never really fully came.[換行字元][換行字元]I did enjoy the movie, and at parts the movie delivered what it promised but it's by no means as great as I was hoping it would be.[換行字元][換行字元]For years we fans have speculated and analyzed what would happen.

It left me disappointed that Russo brothers went with a average at best storyline.[換行字元][換行字元]Infinity War was sort of a standalone movie, a person with basic knowledge of previous movies could watch it and enjoy it. This one, you need to know the entire plot until now. Even then this movie is not as good as the previous avenger movies.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is good and has lots of fan service but the humor seems forced and the story seems questionable.

5396,"Omg, marvel smashed it with his one, such a great ending even tho I cried and hated it in my heart (lol), buf after a bit of time and understanding the impact it had. It was for the best. Hope to see the greatest character come back some day or get his own movie."
5397,"It's quite amazing to watch a movie like. Perhaps because it's more like an experience then just a story. Mainly because you feel for the characters and you move on with them. The two main people/characters in this movie are Cap and Tony...Supposedly the two highest billing cast members surely leave the watchers in an awe kind of expression by the end of the movie.[換行字元][換行字元]The Russo brothers are the best directors when it comes to comic-book homages/adaptations and I mean it. Because when someone says they like any movie directed by these people, they actually don't know that what they're seeing is just a bleak and humane imagery of what happens in the comics, certainly the love for comics of the Russo brothers are unparalleled on that behalf. Some people go to the movies... Well these brothers, they bring comics to life on the big screens and call it a movie!"
5398,Speechless!!! These characters have been with me for half of my life. I couldn't have imagined a better end to this saga.
5399,"I booked my tickets to see endgame, and omg i was so amazed at how the film has been set! In order to understand the movie people would have to have watched the previous movies. You can tell that this movie is going to be a movie which people aren't going to forget!"

The movie takes time to show us the unbearable loss of Infinity War and how the Avengers each deal with it, before a way to bring back all of the victims of the Snap appears. But don't think you know how this is going to go because whenever you think THAT was the big twist, there's probably another one coming.[換行字元][換行字元]New abilities are revealed, emotional arcs are fulfilled and heroes change as Marvel lays the ground work for its next phase that will officially start after the release of Spider-Man: Far from Home this summer. Endgame ends with an open door to the MCU's future, but for the first time since its beginning, the movie does not feature a post-credit scene, leaving us wondering what's to come.[換行字元][換行字元]I feel like this is the kind of movie I'll be happy to say I saw in the theater the day it came out 30 years from now when they remake it for the third time. This is a once in a generation cultural phenomenon and I hope you go see it in the theatre because you will not regret it."
5401,10/10 perfect say no more. Best MCU Film. Best Superhero Film. The End
5402,I'm sorry if this offends someone but I have to be frank. Endgame was way too hyped for an average superhero movie. It feels like after writing the script of Infinity War they didn't know how to take the story forward. Further there was nothing new that we haven't seen or experienced before. So there was no refreshing feeling. I am surprised that IMDB is showing 9.2 rating at this moment when it clearly shouldn't be more than 6. Fan boys would fight to their death trying to prove me otherwise but that's okay.
5403,"Wanted to love this movie like I did infinity war, but unfortunately endgame is like Amanda Holden's face, smooth but no emotion."
5404,"What an experience that was..all those 11 years and 21 movies were leading to this one epic, satisfying and emotional conclusion..Overall the Movie is a Masterpiece...I feel very lucky that I was a part of this Universe that Marvel created.."
5405,I dont like this episode😞 please in the next episode carefully
5406,Avengers End Game is by far the most gorgeous and detailed Cinematic movie ever. Full of emotions and a true character representation. No unnecessary scenes and a true reflection of the hardwork of the MCU. This blissful. Everyone deserves to watch this magnificent piece.
5407,"It worth the hype, the movie was simply amazing and it had a strong emotional impact, I was diving from laughing to tension and sadness, but after all it was a great movie! All the 1 star reviews are wired in my opinion, those people just throw away with hate without even watching the whole MCU or just because they didn t understand the hype."
5408,The best movie of marvell universe I only can say it's awesome
5409,I will go straight to the point and say that the movie is great but not perfect. It was worth the wait and it is a great culmination to the past eleven years of Marvel movies. It is a very long movie so grab some pop corn and drinks. This is a must see for fans of Marvel movies. My advise is to go in with an open mind. Forget all the rumors you may have heard leading up to the movie and just go and enjoy.
5410,"If you haven't watch all marvel movies so please don't try to act cool just by watching only avengers, age of ultron and infinity war. ENDGAME IS PERFECT ENDING FOR THIS SERIES GO WATCH IT ENJOY IT AND DONT READ REVIEW."
5411,"A true ""ending"" to the series, it is such a bittersweet feeling but the movie was amazing."
5412,"Just go watch it, it's a spectacular, emotional, funny and fulfilling end of an 11 year long saga. thank you marvel and all the crew that made all these movies, nothing is ever gonna be the same after this"
5413,"Exceeded all my expectations, a spectacular performance from everyone specially RDJ, stunning visuals, and a beautiful original score."
5414,"I must have watched Infinity War a dozen times, so as you can expect I was expecting big things from this movie. How wrong was I. Shockingly disappointing. The people on here giving 9 and 10's must be scoring infinity war by mistake. The film was so boring and the story was rubbish. CGI took a massive step back for me. I will not be watching this dribble again. Well unless it's on cable tv at Xmas day in 4 years time and I'm too full of dinner to get up and change the channel."
5415,"Brie Larson is simply bad, somewhere between terrible and bland. She's the worst thing about this movies and if it weren't for the not only great but incredibly charismatic cast she'd have definitely tainted this movies. That said, watch it."
5416,"Marvel has put his ear on the peoples who care and value the movies, who live and enjoy a character, who is passionate about a good story, a good orchestration of scenes, sounds, direction, photography. But, even more in the social, political, racial and human environment that we live today.[換行字元][換行字元]With a very human touch and detachment to what we love the most for universal well-being, with a positive message and hope when it seems that everything is finished.[換行字元][換行字元]In a subtle and elegant way, it presents a voice and vision to the audience of the importance of women in today's world, and its relevance to achieving change, equality, rejecting oppression, sexual and labor harassment, and women leaders contribute more and more.[換行字元][換行字元]Marvel has shown us that you can be part of something big, regardless of the physical appearance, mental health, color of the skin, be a hero to oneself and others.[換行字元][換行字元]Marvel, has left a beautiful legacy, very touching, hopeful, but at the same time questioning the audience. Are we doing enough to help our society and this real universe where we live?. The next superhero of this parallel universe can be you or me, are we ready to do whatever it takes?"
5417,This should be higher up the top 250! It was such a great surprise! I've never see anything like it! It was such an epic superhero movie and I loved every minute of it! It has to be one of my all time favourite superhero movie and absolutely favourite movie ever! I can't believe the outcome though! There won't be anymore avengers movies after this!
5418,This film and the entire Marvel series was very well thought out. A lot of new things to see and answers. The crowd was cheering.
5419,"A lot of things from comics I thought impossible to see in the big screen, at least in this iteration of these characters came so unexpectedly that anything I want to say about the film can become a spoiler. What can be said is that they took time to set up the emotional core of the film even though story wise it was going all over the place. But everything pays off with the visual spectacle that gives the highest level of fan service. The epic showdown in the last hour was making the crowd crazy in the theatre."
5420,"Emotional, exciting, unpredictable and happy. What a way to end the infinity saga."
5421,"The movie is exclusive to other marvel movies.It's emotional,intense,thrilling.The Visuals were amazing and grand.The actors are just amazing.This movie is watchable only on IMAX THEATRE."
5422,"Im so happy to watch this movie, thanks marvel and Russo Brother for entertain us and it's really amazed for every scene, i also proud because they can make thousand of people who were waiting and curious about the movie were happy, MCU still the best movie i've ever watched, hopefully there will be another avengers!!"
5423,Simply amazing. Best of the marvel films by far. Great creative writing.
5424,"I'm excited, overwhelmed, happy, sad,angry.. Full emotional roller-coaster"
5425,I went in with the highest expectations and came out underwhelmed and disappointed. its nowhere near as good as infinity war !!!
5426,"One minute in this movie, I already cried. No exaggeration, every 5 to 10 minutes, I cried. Not only because we can feel their pain, but when succeed in something, I cried too. Maybe it was an emotional day for me, but this movie has got to be one of the best movies I've ever watched. Nothing that I'd expect at all. It was even better than my high expectation. So many old and iconic references from this one. Good job Russo brothers."
5427,"This movie had everyone in the movie theatre cheering, laughing and crying throughout the whole movie. Everything you'd hope Endgame to be, IS just that."
5428,It is a wonderful movie Perfect. I can't find any problem with it
5429,"Drowns in its own pool at times but it would be stupid to say this wasn't entertaining af. I could point out a multitude of flaws with this thing (some subplots that come outta nowhere, the mishandled pacing, tone, some of that humour ooft etc) But the film has such an emotional pull that it kinda makes up for it. Without that pull, this woulda been a 6 but the added human element takes this from a forgettable blockbuster to one of the most emotionally resonant superhero films ever. For once I was happy there wasn't an after credits scene.[換行字元][換行字元]EDIT 29/04/19[換行字元][換行字元]Second Viewing[換行字元][換行字元]Second time round stayed mostly the same. Since the surprises were taken out it was a more relaxed and analytical second viewing. While it didn't emotionally impact me as strongly, the film was still engaging enough. Some of the issues I had were amplified and kinda detracted from the overall experience. I'm not lowering my rating because of this but the film definitely loses a bit of its punch on the second viewing. Infinity War got better on second viewing which I think has to do with the Avengers and Thanos having a strong arc, something this film lacks."
5430,This has to be one of the greatest movies of all time. The full story leading up to this is spectacular.
5431,"Just the title. The movie begins slow, it grows with every minute. We don't deserve such a masterpiece. Gonna watch this at least 3 times at theaters. Just amazing. I have no word to describe the feeling of 11 years and 22 movies ending with such a beautiful and unique movie like endgame. Thank you Marvel!"
5432,"Good movie, very funny, would be better if Tom Holland was in it more"
5433,Good movie & emotional but not better than infinity war and 3 hours i saw it so long and first hour was so boring and for the time travel was so Provocation any ideas for time traveling Russo brothers do what they want and don't care for our minds I Think the time travel is owned by DC sorry marvel
5434,What a way for Phase 3 to end. Its crazy that you have waited so long for the movie that you have waited for all your life.
5435,"Terrible long winded mess. Thor goes from ragnarok funny to unbelievably forced... same as the rest of the films jokes... forced. It really is bad. Marvel's lost the plot. Corny, politically correct, gender neutral pleasing tat. Stan Lee would be embarrassed."
5436,End game has hung over movie fans since the Infinity War credits rolled. At 3+ hours it's way too long but necessarily so to weave it all together. I did enjoy it but it does not reach the highs of Infinty War. The first half of the dim explores the avengers lives in the post snap world Thanos left behind and I found this much more intriguing than the action/battle scenes that followed. Been there done that and Endgame brought nothing new to it. The ending was sentimental and I'm afraid all too predictable with an air of end of term good byes throughout. Marvel will continue to roll onwards and enough plot threads were reset to allow many to return or reboot.
5437,Avengers: Endgame pays off everything the Marvel Cinematic Universe has ever build or teased making it one of the best finales ever made. The humongous runtime flies off really fast and even in parts that nothing important plot wise we are given character studies always focusing more on the characters and their motivation than in action .Of course to people that might be worried that the there actually is lack of action don't worry because thare is plenty of that and almost all of it is spectacular and really beutifully made .The only problem that I noticed is that characters that were important and very interesting in previous films are a little bit sidelined.But overall an impressive finale to an impressive decade of filmaking.
5438,After disappointment with both infinity war which on 2nd viewing wasn't as bad as I remembered either and also captain marvel it was a mixture of nerves and hope they could cap it off properly and boy did they deliver the best 3 hours of film I can remember that absolutely flew by. The perfect ending to a largely amazing set of films. A truly mind blowing experience.
5439,"Following the aftermath depicted in last year's ""Avengers: Infinity War"", the gang of superheroes devise a plan to undo the great harm caused by the evil Thanos.[換行字元][換行字元]This film is the forth in the series that originated in 2012. It also happens to be the best. There are signs this could be the last in the series; thus there are emotional moments resulting from some shocking surprises that make us realize that we always felt something for the characters beyond their superhero abilities. More feelings are raised to the surface in time travel sequences when characters are in touch with those they lost a long time ago.[換行字元][換行字元]Another reason this movie stands out in its genre is that it is actually comprehensible throughout. The flaw of convoluted, busy plots have dragged down many in this genre (including prequels to this one) but ""Avengers: Endgame"" stands out for being accessible to those of us who spend only a bit of time in the Marvel Universe.[換行字元][換行字元]In playing with the device of time travel, the story mostly wins except for an inconsistency with the character Nebula near the film's end. This is unfortunate as, up to that point, the Nebula story was one of the most fascinating.

5440,"Part of the journey is the end. We will be ok without you, now rest. Just cannot stop crying though."
5441,You guys went to the cinema and said can I have tickets to endgame but I guess they gave you Justice League tickets. This movie was amazing and Seb tell your boys to chill.
5442,"So I just watch endgame last night the movie it self was actually pretty good. But the things we hoped to see happen that should have happen and things that definitely happened at some points shouldn't. For myself everything I wanted see happen, I guess you could say did but not in the ways myself and probably most fans wanted to see. hoping to see all the redemptions for certain characters from Infinity war didn't really happen in the most satisfying way, I'm trying very hard not to spoil anything for anybody so I'm trying to be very vague with what I'm trying to say some characteristics gets redemptions from the first movie but I feel like it was here do this quickly so we can move on to another scene definitely could have wrapped up in Less than 3 hours.I will say this though in the last half of the movie was probably the most satisfying visually but once it got to the end. I feel like it was hurry this up and get it over with my opinion. So don't base your feelings upon Avengers endgame on what I'm saying here everyone looks at it differently. So this is just my Outlook on it, everyone is going to have a different one.thanks"
5443,"It's absolutely ridiculous how this movie comes close to perfection. Considering the characters' story lines and how much this film does for fans of the franchise, it's truly a masterpiece."
5444,The movie is totally worth watching and everything u want is in the movie the cheer cry emotional feelings everything i loved the movie more than 3000 times and Tony tooo..
5445,"Everything was perfect and amazing apart from like 1 or 2 things. But these things are not major or even minor but things that I wanted to happen that didn't.

5449,"Let me just begin by saying I just finished perusing the bad reviews on here, the 1's out of 10 and my goodness, some people (like very very few) are really hopped up about this movie and in a bad way and I'll just say they could not be more wrong - its their opinion and they're entitled to it but no, just no.[換行字元][換行字元]The pros of this movie are all over the place, the nostalgia, the callbacks and easter eggs, the sendoff of the ending and where it leaves off in terms of future productions was all spot on. Without spoiling it I'll just say the movie was very enjoyable and emotional, all the things you'd want to see in a veritable conclusion years in the making.[換行字元][換行字元]The cons were noticeable but given the entertainment value of the production they can easily be overlooked in favor of the movie, unless you're one of the 1 out 10's people, in which case I just feel bad for you. I really do.[換行字元][換行字元]There were cons were very basic, obvious questions arose because the story uses a plot device that virtually every movie before it that employs this same device does - most of these issues are easily explainable in fictitious terms but if you get hung up on it, just remember its written by entertainers and not scientific gurus writing a book. Other con would be the length, this movie was fantastic but I can't see myself sitting in the theater for 3 hours again, even for this one.[換行字元][換行字元]Bring back intermissions!![換行字元][換行字元]Overall a great movie though, loved it. Probably my favorite and a fantastic followup to Infinity War because it wasn't a regurgitation of last year's film. I'd definitely recommend you go see this in theaters at least once, just for the cinematic experience."
5450,"I'm a huge marvel fan, even to the annoyance of some of my friends, and I think that marvel has produced some of the best to be movies to be released in the past decade. I think films like Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor Ragnarok, and the Captain Americas will age as a definitive part of my generation's history. When the first avengers movie released, I was twelve. It would be no exaggeration to say that the movies that followed were a big part of my teenage years. I'm not even a big action movie guy, but I believe in importance of superheroes.[換行字元][換行字元]This was also possibly the best theater experience I've ever had.

There were plenty of times I couldn't even keep my mouth closed shut.[換行字元][換行字元]Even if you're not a marvel fan though, I'm willing to bet you'll still have a blast. The cinematography and effects are nothing if not masterful. Often, the visuals will be enough to stun you completely. The sci fi elements are creative enough to keep the main plot interesting. The character writing is some of the best I've ever seen. The Russo boys really killed it this time, for one last show.[換行字元][換行字元]The second act of this movie ends up essentially (but debatable, depending on which movies were your favorites,) a kind of ""Best Hits of Marvel"" mix-tape. Then, in the third act, things get so nutty that you can only see it for yourself. The movie is able to call back to the many movies it is, in a sense both a sequel and tribute to, and yet still hold a new and exciting plot elements to explore. It's this balance that holds the whole thing together.[換行字元][換行字元]Somehow, this movie is able to wrap up almost everything the MCU has left open in creative and fun ways.

5454,This what I was been waiting for months for and it really good it was the best marvel movie out there and if you dont see this your real missing out over the fun
5455,"A bittersweet taste has been left in my brain: 2+ hours of sentimental, cheesy dialogues, 15-20 of pure, hardcore action, 3 hours total. I was really confused. Kinda enjoyed this ending, although way far from an epic one."
5456,"In many ways what this film does is to be respected, yet many of its scenes are also messy and get to be too convoluted."
5457,"There is some amazing cgi in this movie but the feeling of ever smouldering ""I'm going to be a hero"" look soon betrayed the shallowness of this epic ""all for one, one for all"" nonsense. A score that does not deliver and the utter nonsense logic of ""time interference"" really lost my suspension of disbelief. I adored the last Thor movie but Holding out for Too many Heroes proved too shallow and nowhere near as Compelling as ""LOTR - Return of the King""."
5458,"The action, the callbacks, the humour, the pacing and the emotions were all on point in this and it's a fitting tribute and finale to this saga of films. It did not feel like I watched a 3 hour film, I just felt I was taken on an adventure."
5459,I'm not really a fanboy but I couldn't resist watching all the movies.

5460,"An American action adventure and comic-book derived fantasy and the twenty-second film in the series of Marvel films. It is a special effects-driven story about a group of earth based superheroes who are living in the aftermath of a cataclysm which destroyed half of all living things in the universe, perpetrated by an alien supervillain called Thanos.[換行字元][換行字元]The film is a direct follow up to ""Avengers: Infinity War"" which showed some of their superhero colleagues killed in the disaster and deals with themes such as loss, revenge, and the attempt to put right past wrongs. It provides some exciting, entertaining action and, for at least those familiar with the previous films and characters, it is emotionally impactful. It has trademark witty humour and smart dialogue, but it lacks the exhilaration of ""Avengers Assemble"" and lacks the high point humour of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"".[換行字元][換行字元]By its second act it begins to feel predictable. It seeks gravitas but too many jokes destroy tension and suspense and a reliance on a well-worn time travel plot device makes for a messy past, present, and future time continuum. Thanos is by far the best and most interesting character, providing subtlety as an archvillain. Thor was reduced from bombastic legend to a belaboured comic routine. Hulk failed to deliver any his trademark power. Much, as always, was left to Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, as a focal point. All in all, the film is entertaining, but it features too many characters which weakens the narrative."
5461,"This movie is what it was meant to be. It is not an easy choice, to make a 3 hours movie. The material has to be good for the intended audience, otherwise the movie becomes trash.

5463,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has given us a lot of great characters and pulling of a final movie that uses all their unique abilities equally was always going to be a near impossible task. Endgame is proof of that. It didn't feel like the Avengers became a real team or learned much during these 22 movies. Their plans and tactics felt amateurish. I was hoping for something deeper and cleverer, but that never materialized. It was entertaining, well produced and acted, but for me it never got near masterpiece territory."
5464,"The first 2 acts dragged out too much, they could cut about 15 min. But the worst part is that the 3rd act is predictable, but with great moments. I really thought there would be some kind of surprise, but there weren´t. I wished I loved this movie so bad, but I was so disappointed with the film. It had great moments but also much meh moments."

5470,"Like much of other series , avengers gets worse with the end. Honestly, to my opinion not worth to go to cinema. Infinity wars was much better. I was expecting a great ending, not this."
5471,Best MCU movie yet. Satisfying conclusion to last 11 years' build up.
5472,Simply brilliant! Super ending to a incredible franchise
5473,This is the best Avengers movie lots of Emotions in this movie
5474,"I would like to assure all readers that I will not be including any spoilers from Avengers: Endgame. This film, according to me, is the finest comic book adaptation I have seen in the form of a movie. This humanised so many heroes that we are used to seeing fight Godly beings. Regardless of the long 182 minutes runtime, the pacing of this film is impeccable. Never does this film seem convoluted or exhaustingly long. However, a note for the non-Marvel viewers contemplating watching this film - this may be difficult to follow if you have not seen most of the previous films, at least the sequences in the middle of the film. For the fans, this really does pay off the 10 years of commitment you have exhibited and shown. Having seen the events of 21 films coalesce here is a privilege for me. I loved every moment and part of the film to the core."
5475,This film...I am speechless. All I can say is you don't have to be a Marvel fan to think this movie is insane. Nothing can beat this
5476,"Not done this in a while but here we go....[換行字元][換行字元]I was shocked by how much I had enjoyed this film, especially from not really enjoying Avengers: Infinity War.

5477,Does anyone know if Groot was based on the Walter Brennan character in the 1948 movie Red River?
5478,"This movie is unlike anything I've ever seen before. It's a time travel movie with the epicness of a Lord of the Rings Film. It has many emotional character moments and visually stunning set pieces. This is the Marvel movie that we have been waiting for for 11 years and I would say it was well worth the wait. Expect to cry, laugh, and cheer a lot. If you're a Marvel fan, I bet you won't be disappointed in the slightest"
5479,"I only have One word for the movie (marvel)[換行字元][換行字元]every things in the movie was perfect i loved every second from the start to they end , and it was absolutely emotional , funny and action .[換行字元][換行字元]i saw it 4 time and i will see him 6 more time."
5480,"Endgame was an amazing movie there was a great story line to it and the characters played all their roles on point and better than ever before. The action and affects in the movie were great. This movie was a movie that always had you on your toes not know what is going to happen next. Other than that great movie, terrific actors and a great end to a great story."
5481,"So one might say that the story focusses too much on some characters, even tho it is the story of all avengers. I never minded that, because it is hard to portrait a movie of so many characters and still make it good.[換行字元][換行字元]I loved the fact that focusing on some characters so many details about thei story, their perspective and their nature are revealed. You can emphatizise and really see their evolution theought their entire series. My mind was changed about some avengers because of this one movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Besides this, there are many other good stuff like cgi, good fighting scenes, the genuine interaction between characters and well, the perfect ending. Yes, it was. It was what they needed (them, the characters) to be at peaced with themselves.[換行字元][換行字元]But let's talk about why I rated 8 and not 10. So, firstly, one big point and a half is lost because it had a really feminist scene. I did not see the role of Captain Marvel which in her own debut film was portrayed as a badass, MVP of the Marvel universe. The avengers were great without her. But the cherry on top was this one scene that made me leave the room (which I did not). It was by far not nevessary and essential to the plot, and was only added because American's political state. Sorry guys, Europe doesn't buy it.[換行字元][換行字元]The last half of point is lost because of Thor. His side of the story could have been great but ended up as something silly. Thor is great because he cares about his peers (and abs). Based on these traits, they kinda made too much fun of him. Really, why? We all know that marvel adds a little bit of funny characters and lines to appeal to the younger audience, which is not bad, but they kinda went too far because it kinda was focussed only on him.[換行字元][換行字元]Before I press submit, let me tell you about the ending. I don't want to spoil it, but I will say this: it will surprise you 😊 the end of an era and the start of a new one."
5482,"Avengers ""Infinity War"" was very intriguing, so the expectations for ""Endgame"" were very high. The cast did an excellent job, although some of lines were hard to understand under the sound mix. The Special effects are pretty stunning, especially in 3D and the product placement is very stylish, neat and futuristic. A nice send off for Stan Lee and his characters. This movie explains a lot of back stories of the spermatozoon heroes and leaves room for development. The cinematography is very convincing as well as wardrobe and props. Entertaining to watch and the long running time seems shorter than it is."
5483,Plain and simple ? my feet were shaking during the film
5484,"Really really enjoyed watching Endgame. Captain Marvel is a distant memory. Despite Brie Larson being featured in Endgame it was only in a couple of scenes so it wasn't too bad. Endgame is incredibly sad, sometimes funny but very entertaining. Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Karen Gillan steal every scene their in. Will definitely watch again. Hopefully in phase 4 Captain Marvel will take a back seat just like Endgame."
5485,"Very good CGI The jokes are funny, the story is interesting You will never get bored The fight scenes are Awesome"
5486,"All the people who have given a rating of 10 to this movie, I would ask IMDB to review if these are fake accounts. I know it's not a rating on 1/10 but then I had to balance the odds. There was simply no real wow moment (except for 1-2 minutes in the end). Week logic, poor surprise element, character mismanagement, sexist/feminist scenes, are some of the many flaws in the story line. The directs blew it big time..."
5487,Awesome ! It will go on top of my life collection..
5488,"As a culmination of over a decade of films, Endgame has lived upto expectations and more."
5489,I loved this movie. The action was great!!! I do not see them ever topping this one. The only thing that would have made it better is if I were in the movie
5490,Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.
5491,I won't put in spoilers just that I love Marvel and I was blown away by how amazing this movie was. Reached all my expectations and more. It deserves all the praise it's getting.
5492,"Oscars all around on this one. Best Picture, Best Director(s) Best Actor, Best Actress, Support roles, Sound Mixing, Adapted Screenplay, Makeup, Cinematography. This movie better win about 14 Oscars. WOW."
5493,"It was more of a celebration than a movie. Beautiful storyline, stunning visuals, power-packed and great performance from everyone involved. Movie of the decade."
5494,It was the best movie ever but sad VERY sad you are litterally going to cry yourself to sleep
5495,"Avengers: Endgame is truly one of those films marketed to satisfy hardcore fans. Watching this film I truly wished that I was one of those fans and could receive the amount of satisfaction that they all seemed to have received from this.[換行字元][換行字元]As an outsider I feel like a lot of the humor was misplaced, a lot of the action scenes were dark and hard to see, a high level of predictability to the film, a loss of logic in a few of the plot lines and a really unforgiving run time. Also given that this movie has a lot of characters in it, there really is a big difference in some of their screen time and not in a good way.[換行字元][換行字元]Putting that all aside though there were some really good scenes, some of the jokes were hilarious and the overwhelming emotion of seeing all the Avengers from over the years finally assemble and give evil a true kick in the face was amazing to see.[換行字元][換行字元]I would definitely recommend seeing the film to form your own opinion and I am definitely glad that the creators gave their fans exactly what they wanted in this ending, as I would like the same sense of loyalty given to me for the saga's that I am I hardcore fan of."
5496,From beginning to end this movie has you on the edge of your seat guessing what's going to happen next. By far the best marvel movie hands down.
5497,"Avengers Endgame was heart wrenchingly awesome yet very fitting, thanks to Marvel Studios for the last 10 years of fantastic films. A fitting End to 10 years of the MCU Universe."
5498,"No Spoilers review ?! I think it would be rude to ask for a more better version of this story..To be honest There is no satisfying ending.. it's always what was best possible way.. Avengers End game makes you realise that your superhero whom you always considered Mentality of steel and Heart full of Power...They are also Human They deserved the life they wanted...And this movie is perfect capturing of what they could do with so less time left on their side...This movie is brilliant, unparalleled dedication..I am happy as well as sad to see this End of an era...But Eventually everything comes to end..So is the movie... Thank you Avengers ! For making our virtual and real world both happy 😊"
5499,With it wrapping up the Infinity Saga it makes an ending that is amazing and so sad! This movie made me completely satisfied and I just want the Russo brothers to know that this movie was phenomenal!
5500,"I agree with many other reviews in that this Avengers is over hyped. However, this movie IS STILL REALLY GOOD. I think a lot of people are giving it bad reviews because people had too high of expectations. Infinty War was a lot more action-packed and became a legendary film partly because Thanos's victory had such a large ""wow factor"" to it. In terms of pure enjoyment, infinity war takes the cake. However, the plot to endgame is really good and the action scenes are still pretty amazing.[換行字元][換行字元]Honestly, my main disappointment with this movie is what they did to Thor's character. Thor was an amazing character in IW but in endgame he is kind of pathetic, DESPITE becoming one of the most powerful avengers by the end of IW. Personally, I wish they had found a better way to use Thor's character in this movie."
5501,"For years Alien has been my favourite film of all time and even then I rated it as an 8.[換行字元][換行字元]But on the 26th April, I got up in the morning and went to the cinema with I skip in my stride. Wondering how this could possibly top Infinity War.[換行字元][換行字元]What I got was the most satisfying and most awesome end to 11 years of amazing story telling.[換行字元][換行字元]Leaving the cinema I knew that Avengers: Endgame was the greatest film I'd ever seen in my life and that's where it will stay forever."
5502,"Saying goodbye to characters that we have grown seeing is the hardest part of the experience. Russo brothers have done it really well. The third act is insane, keeps you on the edge of your seat. The order of some of my favourite characters from the movie are: Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, Nebula, Ant Man.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers will truly be missed."
5503,"It is so easy to criticize this movie because of its countless plot holes (I stopped counting them after the first 30 minutes), logical flaws, cheesy music, surprisingly bad CGI and the usual Disney ideology. Humanity has reached a point where only train wrecks like these can make billions of dollars. The most striking point however is that you can only understand ""Avengers: Endgame"" if you have seen all Marvel movies, believe it or not. It's a movie for fanboys only that live in their own universe which gives them a false sense of superiority while the opposite is actually true. It has happened: Fanboys which operate on the same level as sports fans have hijacked the art form of moving pictures in order to create their own, perpetually self-referential, anti-intellectual universe. It's a sad time for true movie lovers."
5504,The Marvel cinematic journey began with a little movie called Iron Man and ends this particular arc with Endgame...In my opinion the closest you can see an actual comic book come to life...Visually amazing...incredible story ...and characters you genuinely are invested in...The story will test all your emotions in a nice three hour journey that doesn't feel like one...thank you Marvel!!...
5505,"Honestly, no MCU movie has got me so emotionally involved in it's story and Endgame does just that. Not only do I get my CGI epic fight scene fix, I also felt closure with the first 6 avengers this is truly a masterpiece and a Must Watch for any movie buff, casual and child."
5506,"This film, to me, is damn near perfect. Yeah it has a few nitpicky things wrong with it, but it's wrapping up twenty-two films!![換行字元][換行字元]You're not going to see a film of this magnitude again for at least another decade![換行字元][換行字元]It's sweet, it's funny, it's exciting, and you can't even feel time passing. It's a thrill from beginning to end."
5507,I will keep it short - to avoid spoilers.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is expected to be a great one and Fortunately as an end game this is greatest and the best one in the MSU completing this huge epic saga.[換行字元][換行字元]Must watch masterpiece.
5508,"After ten years, we're finally through with the Infinity War Saga/Marvel's Great Experiment.[換行字元][換行字元]To say I was emotional is an understatement, I laughed, I cried, and I cheered.[換行字元][換行字元]There were major issues I had with the plot and major questions I had about the future, but that doesn't spoil the fact that I loved this movie."
5509,"Overall, I think it's not as good as Infinity War. Pretty disappointed with what they did with Thor and the Hulk. Pretty average movie, and much as I hate to say."
5510,"This movie isn't for everyone. Unlike Infinity War, this movie is much more character-driven than previous installments. The story, while a little messy, still came together in a way that made sense to me. The time travel was different from what we all know, and it's explained rather clearly in the film in a way that makes sense. The main story, while a little messy, was also pretty strong and held up on the screen.[換行字元][換行字元]After the masterpiece that was Infinity War, Endgame had a lot to live up to. AT the same time, it couldn't be just like Infinity War without potentially losing the major emotional moments that have been built up to for 11 years. The slower pacing works in the film's favor, making every beat hit home and keeping me invested as it filled out its three-hour runtime.[換行字元][換行字元]In the end, the film works for the most part. There are a few missteps and a few oddities in the film, but unless you get hung up over time travel or don't like superhero movies, you'll probably enjoy this movie to great extent."
5511,Amazing movie but too sad is over. Hope they make more
5512,"The story revolves around the leftover heroes, trying to reverse the decimation of Thanos.[換行字元][換行字元]Everything in this movie is just perfect, except a few plot holes that can be explained.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers: Endgame - the best Marvel movie"
5513,It was amazing all the captain america scenes are perfect everyone have to watch this movie
5514,"They definitely could've condensed this film into around 2hrs. The first two hours were filled with a bunch of chatter that didn't do anything but fill in time. As well as the last hour like everyone said, same ol stuff."
5515,"There were EASILY 45-minutes of this film that should have ended up on the editing room floor. All the things I couldn't stand about the Harry Potter and the LOTR worlds, namely the melodrama and seriousness, have been splattered all over my cinematic universe. When, (spoiler redacted) dies, I was seriously thinking, ""I know (spoiler redacted) is a big effing deal but he/she has been in the process of dying for 11 hours and 5 minutes."" That was the thing about all the major deaths too. Pretty much all the heroes who fall have frustratingly long funereal sequences, as if a real person died. If (spoiler redacted) had died in real life during the production of the flick, then, by all means, have a sappy, meandering funeral scene for him. However, (spoiler redacted) is alive and VERY WELL; so, that funeral was a ridiculous waste of time. I would have enjoyed spending that time watching well-executed action sequences and superhero shenanigans. Not to mention, these deaths are not even vaguely sad to me. The MCU has countless avenues by which they may resurrect ostensibly any character offed; so, yeah, with that in mind, give me a break with all the very ""DC"" gloom. My last beef is with Captain Marvel. Seems to me she could have ended that mess pretty damn quickly. Instead, she decided to disappear for 2/3 of the movie, visit the worst barber shop in the galaxy while she was gone, and then reappear just in time to demonstrate how easy this whole ordeal could have been handled had she only stuck around in the first place. It's kind of stupid to have her in the movie, because the MCU has adorned her with such omnipotence that no foe stands a chance. She's like bringing a bazooka to a water-balloon fight. One second, everyone's splashing around, having a good time. Then, Danvers shows up and the whole neighborhood ends up dead. She's just too powerful to be cinematically useful. Movies featuring Carol Danvers that are longer than 30 minutes are not really being honest. Overall, ""Endgame"" was exhausting. Somebody had to tackle the undertaking of its creation. In that task, the cast and crew were largely successful; but, still, something was missing. Maybe Paul Bettany was the Avengers' lucky charm."
5516,....after The dark knight The dark knight is the best ever. Endgame is a pretender
5517,"Go and watch the movie its outstanding movie avengers endgame is a complete package of acting, emotion, action etc directing was also oustanding in the movie all the character in the movie was outstanding yah but at last u will feeling crying after seeing ur fav character dying."
5518,Not much to say Awsome movie time flew while watching it. Rollercoaster ride of emotions. Well done.
5519,"Perfect ending to a saga that many of us grew up, it brings an end to a tonne of character arcs that began all the way back with Ironman 1."
5520,Amazing film loved every minute of it a fitting end to the 22 films
5521,"What can I say. It is rare a film comes out this perfect. Unbelievable. I can't say anything, but you have to see it. You Have to."
5522,"OMG Guys ! This was the best Directed, edited and everything in a marvel movie ever. I love how they play with our emotions one moment you are sad and the next one you are laughing. In addition, they gave every character the perfect screen time ! I Must say that everyone should see this MASTERPIECE On IMAX to see the beauty of it."
5523,"Poor cgi for big budget movie! Nothing special in acting, regular things... Copy story from other movies like Inception and Star Trek.. Poor cinematography and soundtrack! General nothing special, nothing unique!"
5524,"Endgame is an epic adventure , emotional roller-coaster with full of plot twists and conclusion to all that 11 years of storytelling. while watching #endgame I was laughing so loud, clapping so hard and got emotional in the end. What an experience! Sooo Goood."
5525,Marvel movies arw best.but avanger end game is fabulous its whole story is good.awesome move.i suggest you to please go for it and watch it
5526,"Let me just get started, this is the best mcu movie ever made. Started off a bit slow but after the first hour I started jizzing everywhere. Understanding the movie by watching all the previous ones makes the movie just way better. Thor had a massive role in infinity war and did a lot of work, so it would be unfair if he did everything in this film. When you break the movie down every character played a significant role, and was played perfectly. When captain America held mjlonir I literally started shaking. And the last fight between thanos and the avengers is the nets fight scene in superhero history. There is no post credit scene as it is the end of a huge story. I'm so glad I got to life during the time of the mcu and live my life to the fullest"
5527,"This is a 182 minute movie... that's 3 hours and a bit in old money. It's a long one. In the first 30 minutes it was threatening to be the slowest start to a movie since three hobbits went on a long walk but it turns a corner and keeps on moving forwards leaving the audience captivated and riveted. By the 2 hour mark we are back to the future past and there wasn't a moment to pop for a toilet break. The packed Cinema had fallen silent with all foodstuffs consumed and everyone glued to the action. This is Marvel on steroids.. Massive cast, stunning visual effects and some great funny dialogue (with very satisfying other movie references) ... there's no typically resounding finale as the action switches to tug gently at the hearts of movie goers who have invested in these characters over the years. There were several teary eyed people in amongst this audience beyond the end-game... I thought they might be tears of tiredness but my initial cynicism was rewarded by a sentimental and charming conclusion. That said I would doubt that this really is the end-game ... but if it was then it was a good one."
5528,"We feel energetic & emotional while watching the film beacuse we grown up watching these Characters, & thats the core marvel reached.but overall movie is too long and not that great as we expected from the hypes after infinity war.but still worth watch & cry."
5529,It's a masterpiece! Thank you.[換行字元][換行字元]🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
5530,"Thought it was boring, can't remember anything I liked about it. Only went cuz a friend said it was good, reminded me a bit of Harry Potter."
5531,"Where to begin. This movie was everything I wanted and more. It was unpredictable, kept me guessing and was full of action and character driven moments. The story was the perfect conclusion to the characters we know and love and the epic storyline built over eleven years. There was only small nitpick I had about the movie, but to reveal it would spoil the experience that is Avengers: Endgame. The acting is phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evens, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner all give 110%, as does the supporting cast. The way this film wrappes up the journies of the characters we've known for so long is beautiful. All of the characters could not have had better endings. The film is heartbreaking, exciting and well written. It's deserves all the praise it's getting. See this film, now! Before someone spoils it and because it needs to be seen on the big screen. Trust me, the climax is one of the biggest and most exciting climaxes put to film. This is the best film in the MCU, the best film of 2019 so far and will most likely continue being so and it is one of my personal favourite movies, I enjoyed it that much. 10/10. Book tickets as soon as you've finished reading this. It'll be the most exciting 3 hours of your life."
5532,"Avenger Endgame is conclusion of MCU at its best.The movie is a priceless possession of Marvel studios and for its fans.Fans showed great excitement during entire film and also hands down to entire crew. The film is too great and shouldn't be spoiled so just go and watch it, you will love it(even said to me by a true DC fan)"
5533,"Good movie but avengers infinity was much better then end game , but the continuty is good with the 3rd part to 4th one"
5534,"Marvel did justice to all the character's for this epic showdown. The first half of the film is all about getting the team and time traveling. The next part of the film is epic as the take down Thanos in what I would say ""An Epic Battle"". Finally ,we get to here Cap says those magic words "" Avengers Assemble"" and you see all those character's you have seen in the last 11 years. Overall, it's Awesome and just go to theatre and experience it."
5535,This movie is very emotional.Some scenes in this movie I got goosebumps.
5536,"A brilliant ending to the Avengers series. It doesn't top Infinity War which is simply in a league of it's own, but it does do it justice. It's a slower pace than Infinity War, but the build up is worth it.[換行字元][換行字元]I knocked off a few stars for what they did with Hulk and Thor, who were two of my favourite characters from the franchise, especially after Ragnarock.[換行字元][換行字元]It's a shame that there won't be another Avengers movie after this one, but I guess all good things come to an end."
5537,"Wow, this movie is truly everything. Avengers Endgame is the perfect love letter to fans of the marvel cinematic universe over the past 10 Years. This 3 hour masterpiece will have you on the edge of your seat going through all your emotions, you will laugh, you will cry, you will gasp, you will be amazed, and you will be surprised to see how well the Russo Brothers managed to create an iconic finale to the 10 year saga.[換行字元][換行字元]I've already seen the film twice in the 3 days it's been in theatres and I do plan on watching it a third time because it is just THAT good. I remember the first time I saw it on Wednesday Morning April 24 I was nervous at first cause I grew up with these characters and their stories. These movies taught me so much growing up and really made my childhood memorable. During the previews before the movie I had flashbacks of when I saw Iron Man 2 for the first time in the cinema with my mom, then when I saw The First Avenger with my brothers, and so on. There were certain sequences in this film which made me revisit my childhood memories and I really connected with this movie. I don't really cry during movies but this one definitely made me choke up at least twice. Avengers Endgame has satisfied me on a very personal level and it's just beautiful to see this story come to a beautiful end.[換行字元][換行字元]Usually movies will nail at least 1 of 3 acts, this one nails all 3 perfectly. I had no issue with this film, it was entertaining the whole 3 hours and it never disappoints. The cast it INCREDIBLE, they truly delivered something REMARKABLE. The Russo brothers and Kevin Feige have put an immense amount of effort into this film and I cannot thank them enough for the work they've done and the way their work honours what the late Stan Lee has started. Finally Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans have put their ALL into this film and delivered something that will be remembered for decades and I can guarantee you that nobody will ever replace these characters in the MCU and our hearts. This movie is made for the fans and to honour the work of Stan Lee and it really lives up to its expectations. Nobody will ever replicate what Kevin Feige did with these characters which makes this all so ICONIC. Avengers Endgame overall 10/10, if I could give it any higher I would cause this movie really deserves it. GO SEE THE MOVIE IN THEATRES, avoid the spoilers and enjoy this thrill ride of a movie which will get you in your feelings. THANK YOU STAN!"
5538,"IMO this is the greatest MCU movies of all-time! There are many mixed emotions while watching this movie![換行字元][換行字元]I don't want to spoil the movie. You better watch this movie with your friends, your family, or even yourself alone.[換行字元][換行字元]I love this movie more than three thousand!"
5539,Godawful movie. Took itself too serious. The girlpower bit was groan out loud cringe. Fat thor pointless. Half a hulk just annoying. Ending was longer than lord of the rings. Big fight scenes awful cgi. Everything got thrown at the screen and none of it stuck
5540,What an amazing film to end an amazing saga. I was on the verge of tears throughout from laughs to heart-wrenching moments. Absolutely a film I will watch time and time again.
5541,"The endless scenes with Hawkeye and Black Widow, where both of them look tired and bored out of their minds, I really, really could do without. I understand it's a closure movie, but Marvel needs to realise that self sacrifice themes and melodrama are not touching anymore. They're overdone, cliche, wastes of time. The death at the end, on the other hand, was on spot, not too sugary and truly moving. Thor was just perfection, and the action packed Captain America scenes were definitely looked forward to throughout the movie. I think there is a nine star worth film in this movie, but god it needs editing, the scenes were just stacked on top of another, it was bad guys. I really hope they release a different cut at some point and do this film some justice."
5542,It looks like too many people meddled with the script and ruined the movie
5543,"Man! I thought Infinity War was off the hook, but this one... A perfect compliment to a two part epic. It was what I thought it was going to be, a lot of talk, a lot of planning, but amazingly it was not boring. Not for one second! Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years. Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man). Loved Mark Rufflo in this film and Thanos baby, still the baddest villain around. It's fun it's dramatic, it's like Lord of the Rings with one less movie. Three hours well worth the ticket. Stan Lee would be proud! Nuff said!"
5544,Dont get me wrong I did enjoy the film the first hour and a half I felt was a bit pointless but then wow it was amazing so I feel 7 is all it deserves due to the start
5545,The best movie of marvel after gurdians of the galaxy

Some of the most important characters to Endgame got little screen time which was upsetting. And one of the characters ending was absolutely horrible and made no sense according to the movie or to the comic book."
5549,"If you're am MCU fan then this movie is pure magic. The characters have never felt more human, the performances particularly Downey, Evans, Scarlett and Renner are terrific and the third act is pure comic book magic. If you're not a fan of mcu movies then this movie will probably confuse the hell out of you, the Russo's made this movie for all the fans and I cannot thank them, the screenwriters and Kevin Feige enough"
5550,This movie was a great ending to the arc of the franchise. Full of action some comedy and over all great production.
5551,I didn't like the acting. Thanos doesn't seem like the badass of the first movie
5552,"What an absolute gem of a movie. It's not just a movie but a wonder of our times. You just cannot stop appreciating it. The cast, the director,producers and all the team associated. Bravo. You have produced a gem. Thanks for 10 years of love."

5556,"When I went to the cinema, I wasn't hoping that this would be a great movie. The preceding Marvel movies hadn't been able to impress me that much. But this was way better that them. This was a result of really good writing and a lot of brilliant ideas for the narrative to move forward. The way that the story proceeded was out of the ballpark of the things I can predict. It was a bit different than the previous movies.[換行字元][換行字元]Comedy was inserted aptly, both time wise and amount wise. The soundtrack was amazing as usual. Direction, CGI and cinematography was also pretty commendable. The action scenes, especially the final battle was extremely well executed. Dialogue could been better and could have been more. The ending didn't feel that gripping and I felt that they could have ended it sooner."
5557,"A movie bigger than this has never been made or attempted. Critics who do not appreciate the movie or say its 'just another superhero movie' take this movie alone. This is NOT a standalone movie, its a closing to a spectacular franchise and it was satisfying on so many levels, I cant even explain. There were so many moments in the movie that made one appreciate the depth of character, backstory,human bonding, sacrifice and ofcourse comedy and action, that I cannot even point them out even if I wanted to.[換行字元][換行字元]To enjoy the movie, at least watch most of the MCU movies. This is the movie of the decade and you WILL ENJOY THIS"
5558,"It's all about a Marvel movie which takes the same old road to glory: new and old characters all put together, stories that cross one another and turns that we +/- expected. In my humble opinion it doesn't deserve the #5, not even top #100 ..."
5559,Long periods I was bored. Questioning why this scene was taking so long. Never a 9/10 film ever
5560,Its a bit dead in the midle act but in the end with the big fight and evrything it all ads up to the best film of 2019 so far
5561,"What I saw is bunch of human warriors which each has special skill and ability and fight for what believed as right path. Superheroes don't joke, cry or get desperate. Superheroes don't reject any call for helps. Superheroes don't do silly things. They do. They are all human. A super kind human, with huge hearts. At the end that is what I get.[換行字元][換行字元]Both directors very well done bringing up a new thing, joining the heroic plot, whilst it is superhero movie we believed filled by tons of tough guys, and not anymore, every single one is vulnerable.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you everyone, in producing this movie. It is a bad news for any superhero movies coming up next, though. Both from MCU or DCEU. One heavy standard has been stamped."
5562,"Don't know what to write in the review, just watch it"
5563,I can introduce this movie to one of the best marvelstudios films. This is movie really masterpiece!!! I rated this 10/10!
5564,"It's hard to believe that this is the highest grossing movie of all time. It's not even that good of a Marvel movie.[換行字元][換行字元]I understand that this is based on a comic book characters but damn! The fact that this movie is so successful is pretty much the reason why Hollywood thinks they can get away making movies that aren't all that well thought out but look cool. The first hour was downright painful to get through and if they had taken out a lot of the unnecessary crap, this movie easily could have been 2 hours long."
5565,I can only conclude that Disney are using bots to post 10 star ratings for this film. Infinity War is better in every conceivable way. I have to confess that after infinity war I had no idea how they could possibly top that.... it was going to take some great writing to turn the events of IW and create a movie that was better again.......I didn't happen. I can't emphasize how bad I thought the story was. It feels like a desperate attempt to conclude this saga early so they can start on the next wave. 1. You can't introduce a character as powerful as captain marvel into a fist fight. 2. Never ever ever use time travel in any movie... unless it's a comedy like bttf or hot tub. 3. Don't create scenes that make no sense just to appease the woman's movement in Hollywood...cheap[換行字元][換行字元]Infinity war deserved so much more than this.[換行字元][換行字元]Do yourself a favour and finish your saga with infinity war and forget this mess of a movie ever existed.
5566,"I am glad it's over. Please give some culture to younger generation now. It's enough with the cheesy dialogues, meaningless conversations, stupid jokes. It was an entertaining film but that's all. I liked watching the crazy visual effects, CGI and great landscapes from other planets. But just it's the end, they pushed so hard to show every character who was ever in a Marvel movie. And they tried to connect them into the storyline but it didn't work."
5567,"I'm so disappointed in this film as it was the End! I waited months, maybe even a year for this to come out. I didn't watch any trailers or listen to any critics because I wanted this experience to be epic. It was boring, dull, flat and uninspiring. The messed with a few characters and in my opinion, ruined them. The fight scenes weren't the best and it did smack of SJW at times. Captain Marvel played a very small role in this, which I'm glad about, and somehow still managed to look like the hero. I'm a huge fan of the MCU which is why I'm extra disappointed. I can't figure out why this has such a high rating...or can't i 🤔"
5568,"Endgame really makes you look at all the movies as a whole series of events with an outcome. It makes all the movies come together in a way that makes everything better. They really did something special with Endgame, especially with the challenges they had going into it."
5569,"This is a spectacular movie, not just for Marvel readers."
5570,"Maybe it's better to see Infinity War (2018) because it do picks up what is left of that particular flick. Clocking in over 3 hours it was for me way too long to watch.[換行字元][換行字元]Maybe no-one will understand me but 3 hours it has to be good.

5571,I am so emotional watching the last movie of ironman. This movie is awesome. I am happy to being part of the marvel universe.
5572,Since i watched avengers movie just only this phase 3 movies (endgame) is make me holding pee til movies finish
5573,"There is no comparing Endgame with Infinity War. Sure, the CGI holds up well and the flashbacks are nice, but the storyline is just bad. Overly emotional and a halfwitted plot is the signum of the movie. As a fan of the cinematic Avengers I was dissapointed whilst watching and even more so leaving the cinema. Some decisions in the movie would be better undone and I recommend any fan to stop at infinity war, even tho many heroes death it is more honorable than what Endgame holds for them."
5574,The end of this whole 11 years couldn't be better than this.Every second is worth watching.It's a masterpiece.
5575,Infinity War was much better. This movie was all over the place and lazy. They reduced Thor and Hulk to an absolute joke.
5576,"Endgame was perfect. There was closure, it was bittersweet, tragically sad and so very funny at the same time. 3 hours went by like a snap, will definately rewatch it when it's out digitally. 10/10 seems like a low score."
5577,"WATCH THIS MOVIE![換行字元][換行字元]I wasn't sure, going into this, whether it was gonna be good or not. We all know how anticlimactic some endings to series' can be. But this movie is honestly more than I could have ever imagined. I saw a few things coming, but not in a bad way, they were all things that when they happened I was happy.[換行字元][換行字元]First act was minimally slow, but it had to be there and was still enjoyable nonetheless. Overall I felt a roller coaster of emotions throughout, laughing one scene and then crying the next, at some points even a mixture of both, I can't praise this movie enough.[換行字元][換行字元]Absolute work of art, left me feeling incredibly content and I already want to watch it again!"
5578,"Waste of money and time full of depressive heroes who cry like little babies for 5 full years. The prior is 100 times better than this crap with mediocre lines, but I guess that this is what the masses ask for..."
5579,I liked how this movie pays tribute to all previous films either by showing similar scenes or dialogues
5580,What a great way to wrap up this journey! Well done!
5581,Marvel End Game is the Best movie I've ever seen!! Im still crying
5582,"It's like they wrote the script after 3 AM the day before the deadline. This is the worst Marvel MCU film ever. Even Age of Ultron was seriously better than this,"
5583,"A really good ending to a 11 year, 22 movie franchise."
5584,Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. Respect for the Russo Brothers for taking the direction they did with Endgame and it really does satisfy but Infinity War is overall a more entertaining movie. An experience you'll gonna remember forever.
5585,What can I say... read the title. Go watch it!!!! You still reading?
5586,Now EndGame is top on my fav movies list. And stand #1 in the history of best marvels cinematic universe ever.
5587,Why don't I give this a ten? Simple everything about this movie is perfect except that nobody says Excelsior or that it doesn't say Rip Stan Lee or something. They should have done something in honour of him. But apart from that this is just pure art
5588,Make THOR another movie to fix The God of Thunder. 'THOR n The Guardian of the Galaxy. I will give 10 stars...
5589,"Really good movie, my kind of movie overall. I love Thors hippie style <3"
5590,"This is not only a movie it is an emotion created by marvel, if u gonna miss this one then u r doing a big mistake, for all the marvel fans AVENGERS :END GAME is a masterpiece. Hats off to the entire marvel team for creating such a wonderful movie full of action, comedy, drama, and overall heart touching emotion."
5591,"I cried after watched Endgame,best Marvel movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5592,I saw the good critics and box office high grossing smash. I really love that. Thank you Disney
5593,"Had a lot of expectations. But everything fizzled out. Wanted it to end after interval but friends, huh.[換行字元][換行字元]They made the mockery of Hulk, Thor and Doctor Strange. They are damn powerful in the comic folklore but the movie ruined everything.[換行字元][換行字元]Pro- Captain America got the limelight and am happy about that.[換行字元][換行字元]The execution of women empowerment was not that great. Then the mantle of captain america was passed on to different character. Good that the society is learning but it should not be the case of getting money from all the sections by showing off/or what you don't have faith in.[換行字元][換行字元]Guardians of the galaxy is far better than this. I am disappointed."
5594,In one sentence awesome and great movie. Its the perfect end of mcu's 10 years. Thanks for giving such a good movie like endgame
5595,Been a marvel fan all through eleven years. Watched every single movie on the opening day. It has The perfect ending. You would leave the theaters with a heavy heart for sure but with content that you've witnessed something truly amazing. I ve gone with a high expectation of course but they crossed it. You can't have asked for more. It's a gift from marvel to us fans. If only the tickets were available I would ve definitely gone for the next show as well. You're gonna experience each character. Thank you Marvel.
5596,"It could have been better, the first part had a more complex screenplay."
5597,"No words, it had everything that you could want in a film. Cant predict what's going to happen either."
5598,"Homage to so many points in the MCU, humor, action, adventure, romance, bromance, the perfect conclusion to the Infinity Stone saga."
5599,"Goodbye Avengers and well done for all the amazing movies, brought a lot of joy to a lot of people."
5600,"The Movie is Incredible, Best Marvel Movies and Best Superheroes Movie ever, from best 5 Movies I have ever seen"
5601,"There are two types of people who have written reviews. People who truly do not appreciate the franchise and then the ones that do! This was a perfect ending. I cried, I laughed but mostly the movie did not leave me feeling disappointed!"
5602,"Emotional. The perfect goodbye. A movie for the fans, to the fans."
5603,I watched avengers endgame last night and it was amazing. Don't wait for the post credit scenes there is none.
5604,Story keeps u excited and binding to yr seat sometimes goosebumps And all actors give their 100% but rdj always gives his 200% love u 3000
5605,"Think I've watched a different film to most reviewers! It's too jokey too cheesy and too long, infinity war was brilliant this is well below that level."
5606,Don't listen to these trolls. If you've been a fan of the MCU you will love this. The one star reviews are absolutely ridiculous. The least you could give this movie is a 7 star rating.
5607,"Everything comes to an end and this movie was perfection, by far one of the best and most waited for movie in the world. It has everything a Marvel fan would want, with a rollercoster of emotions, honestly a masterpiece and an amazing end of an era! Thank you Marvel"
5608,"There are so many great moments in this movie, both the moments that expand on characters' relationships and the fan service ""hero shot"" moments. To be honest, I can't think of a single moment that I wanted to see that was not included. An awesome movie!"
5609,"Just finished watching it in China, fantastic CG job, but I think the story should be better, maybe make it a two-ending will be better"
5610,Marvel needs to shorten movies to 2 hours. Movie was way too long...
5611,"Simply amazing from start to finish and totally worth all the laughter, action, suspense but most of all the emotional rollercoaster the last 11 years have been but still it didn't prepare me for what the film produced which is an action packed 3 hours of pure entertainment of the highest calibre from the directors all the way to the set crews but the biggest praise has to go to the cast especially the original 6 who have guided us on the magical mystical journey from start to finish and a huge thank you to all of them!!"
5612,"After watching Avengers: Endgame, I didn't like how the remaining Avengers came up with the way to solve the crisis. I was like ""What?! Is it that simple to do that?"", ""Huh?! How did they knows where to look for them or when to come to help?""[換行字元][換行字元]Antman, Iron Man, Cap, ""Rabbit"", and Natasha didn't disappoint me at all. They were great. Love to watch those scenes with these characters.[換行字元][換行字元]Thor is like a clown since Ragnarok.[換行字元][換行字元]Fighting scenes were alright but some were too shaky. I don't like the shaky fighting scenes. Nauseating![換行字元][換行字元]Thanos and Hulks' CGI look like Shrek CGI.

I don't hate it but i don't love it[換行字元][換行字元]There were some parts of the movie that i I feel like skipping.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, it's not the best movie I'd ever watched but it's not a bad movie."
5613,"For me, Avengers: Endgame is honestly the greatest, most thrilling and epic film of the MCU, the battle scenes and performances shown were never done before in Marvel cinematic history and they will leave you with so much surprises![換行字元][換行字元]11 years in the making and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT. It exceeded everyone's expectations and even the comic book nerd ones![換行字元][換行字元]Go see it while you can because you will NEVER ever experience something like this in a movie theatre this breath-taking and shocking.[換行字元][換行字元]It also had such an amazing and satisfying wrap-ups to the major characters of the MCU. Couldn't ask for a better movie and a better way to end this hell-of-a journey."
5614,"So many marvel movies until this moment. To be honest, I was never a marvel fan and probably this was the reason why I wasn't impressed with the previous Avengers. I just didn't care about the characters simply because I didn't know who they were (most of them). I didn't see their movies and frankly hadn't heard of them. However, this movie managed to touch me and I felt connection even to those characters. I didn't expect very deep and twisted plot (even though movie delivered a good one), I didn't expect amazing visuals (the movie delivered good ones). I only wanted to build a connection with so many characters I didn't know. And the movie delivered this to me amazingly good. I was surprised I actually cared about them in the end. The movie deserves an 8 If I have to be not biased but as a DC fan who always criticized Marvel Movies (probably because I hate it that DC doesn't perform that good) I believe a 9 is also well deserved. Good Job, Marvel!"
5615,"I could have given this movie a score of 100 out of 10, which means that this could be the most astounding movie of all time. But unfortunately it didn't deserve it. As you might find in many other reviews, people are giving high scores and mostly 10. I could've done such thing, but prefer not to. Why?[換行字元][換行字元]It turns out that you still can see some obvious flaws in the movie. But most people will not notice it because they're just following the hype of conceiving this as the best movie of the year.[換行字元][換行字元]In Infinity War (previous movie), everybody know that at the end of the post credit scene, Nick Fury summons Captain Marvel to help the Avengers in the fight against Thanos. This make every viewer expect that Captain Marvel will play a significant role in Endgame. But I think due to many criticism for the solo movie ""Captain Marvel"", the director decided to make Captain Marvel has less role in Avengers: Endgame. Hence, after you watch this Avengers: Endgame, you'll start to wonder, why did Nick Fury ask for her help when the Avengers could defeat Thanos without her anyway?[換行字元][換行字元]The second flaw, is when you'll notice something is just not right. I mean when you're in an ""Armageddon battle"", where millions of units are killing each other, you'll expect to see tons of explosions and tons of moving objects at every part of the battle field. Instead, you'll be disappointed in this part. Whoever is the consultant or the chief of CGI, failed to deliver the most epic ""Endgame battle"" of all time.[換行字元][換行字元]So as a conclusion, it's just ALMOST perfect."
5616,"Perfect plot twist, the story line is amazing.. i love it"
5617,"Am I alone in feeling that my heart hurts??? I could say so many fantastic things about the ending of an era...but I will keep it simple. I was wowed, I was sad, I was happy, I was was wowed again, I was stressed, I was OMG, I was crying, I was mad, I was wowed again....and now I feel LOST!!! I truly feel as though I have lost a part of my life! All fans will. There is no going around it.. There is only surving the Endgame and letting your tears flow freely to pay homage to the thrill ride of an ERA. STAN LEE & MARVEL.....thank you for a lifetime of Joy, Excitement, Entertainment, Friends, Laughter, Tears and an Other World's that made this One just a little better!!! XOXOX."
5618,"Exactly what I wanted from this movie. All the characters have their moment. Lots of fantastic callbacks. May be filled with fan service, but it all worked for me."
5619,The Best Movie Of All Time So Far Because It Has All The Things To Entertain You. Every Thing Was Good In The Movie. The Russo Brothers Have Done A Superb Job. And At Last Love RDJ. U R My Idol.
5620,"Filme com enredo muito bom, parabéns aos roteiristas."
5621,"I very much enjoyed the movie, however (without giving spoilers) I'm left scratching my head about where things like Agents of SHIELD, and Spider-man - Far From Home fit within the timeline.[換行字元][換行字元]Apart from that, I'm happy with how the story unfolded (even with plot holes) It didn't seem like a long movie to me. I know many people aren't happy with the direction that Thor has taken, but I enjoyed the comedy of Thor and Banner. Surprisingly there was nothing that really hit me in the feels, the way that most Marvel movies have managed to do at least once. But I did find love for certain characters solidified in this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, it's kinda predictable (as most are in the genre) with a few surprising moments in it, and some good laughs. A very satisfying end to The Infinity Saga."
5622,Its best movie I have ever watched that's all I have to say #Endgame
5623,Yyyeeesssss that's the marvel movie that we need just grat and brilliant!
5624,"Here we are at the Endgame and what you get is a treat of all your loved superheroes from MCU giving all they have to take the time back to where we wished for. There are moments where you laugh, cry and feel proud as well but then the establishment of story isn't as appealing as The End to 10 years of a Successful Run should have been. We knew the end, but we would have loved to have a thoughtful Plot as well. Writing is plain goal directed and acting is good. Technically its a strongest game to witness and Emotionally its an Orgasm for a FanBoi. Overall a 3hrs climax to mind who was programmed to amaze with a Winning Run. We love you 3000 #AvengersEndgame #svjreviews"
5625,And I Thought I was Prepared for The End... 😢😢😢 Perfectly Completes 'The Biggest and My Most Favorite Story Ever Told'. (The Infinity Saga). and 'Journey of My Favorite Character'. (Iron Man)
5626,Whoever hasn't seen this movie yet in theaters!!! Please go and check it out!! It is definitely worth the money!!! The Russo brothers have done an outstanding job directing this whole entire film!! I am extremely proud of their hard work!!!
5627,No other words need be spoken. No idea when/if we will see another build up of this caliber.
5628,Start was slow and it gets even slower with usual MCU humor to guide us through for the build up to fight MCU deserved and lacked in previous movies.
5629,What do I say this movie in incredible I started watching marvel movies around when the first avengers movie came out ever sense I seen everyone of them
5630,The best ending to an 11 year journey. The best of the 22 movies released so far. Perfect balance of sadness excitement and suspense.
5631,"Just an amazing finale, perfection at its definition, I loved every frame and ever little character beat, such a well crafted masterpiece of cinema"
5632,"Endgame is the perfect final chapter to the MCU's first stage, and rewards its loyal fans who've kept with the franchise for 20+ movies. Expectations were exceptionally high for this one and as far as I'm concerned they absolutely nailed it."
5633,Good film. It could be great if there was not that much idiot jokes and that Thor was threared as non idiot. And everyone who says this is better than Nolan's trilogy is idiot. Anyone who says this is better than Man of steel or BvS or Watchmen is also an idiot.
5634,Avengers Infinty war broke us into two pieces with it's shock ending Thanos has done what he set out on doing he collected all of the infinty stones and he snapped his fingers and half of reality into dust and The Avengers and the rest of the universe felt the effects of the snap and now the remaining Avengers pick up the peices from whats happend and now must avenge the fallen. The usual cast return for endgame the cast is very large so i will not individualy mention every actor and actress they all had a large role in the movie and they all play a equal part in the story. Special mention has to go obviously to Josh Brolin as Thanos he is just incredible as probabaly one of the best villians put into film and Thanos has proven in Infinty War and in Endgame that he is such a great villian and he always will be. Special mention also has to go to Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr they have officialy left Marvel and the MCU and I wish them well on there next projects and I want to thank them for what they have contributed to Marvel and the MCU and they have always been a part of my life and they always will be and they were the foundation on what the entire MCU and the 10 years of incredible movies which have been a part of thousand of lives so thank you for all of your hard work. Things that I loved about Endgame well it's everything nothing really dissapointed me i felt every emotion happy sad and everything imbetween becides some minor plot holes that I felt spoiled some parts I thought it was amazing and it was by far Marvel's best film in it's filmography. It was incredible what a experience and the best 3 hours i have spent watching a movie 10/10
5635,"No words. Absolutely, no words! Just watch this and you will see"
5636,The perfect ending for the avengers Very sad and very emotional So much of laughing The movie got every thing you need I loved it very much So sad at the ending

5639,"Amazing movie , I enjoyed every second of it. The best part of the avengers!!!!"
5640,I laughed so loud I clapped with so much force and I cried so hard the movie exceeds every expectation and is the perfect culmination of the entire marvel cinematic universe[換行字元][換行字元]Avoid spoilers as all costs !
5641,Entertaining action and certainly comical interaction between characters but a disappointingly predictable culmination of many years and many movies.
5642,This made a decade of going to the movies worth it. I couldn't find the part with AC Slater the first time I watched it. So I watched it again. It's the only movie I have seen in years that holds a candle to the unauthorized saved by the bell story.
5643,"I liked ''Infinity war'' very much . In fact , it was a motivation for me to see the other superhero movies in order to understand the entire plot of the series . '' End Game ''is a total disaster . I was sitting in my chair waiting two hours for the movie to actually begin . While ''Infinity war '' was an almost non stop combat with mind blowing CGIs , ''Endgame'' is far from it . I am just wondering what's in the mind of those who gave between 7 - 10 stars .There are two posibilities : the lack of critical rationality or , perhaps, they are first class fans who swallow everything Marvel releases . I was being indulgent by offering 3 stars . And I think many of you will share my point of view ."
5644,Amazing!! A fantastic movie and a fitting end to the Avengers series. It had everything.
5645,Absolutely outstanding end to the saga. The climactic ending was worth the 3 hour wait.
5646,"An amazing end to this particular universe portrayed on screen. The first predominance of the movie was filled with lots of MCU Easter eggs and funny character moments which was great whilst putting a gentle wrap on numerous MCU stories that had cumulated up till this point. The last predominance of the movie is something new and adds a totally different out take on what we've seen up till this point, my favourite culmination of scenes so far!! Wasn't expecting the ending one bit which is what you want and it pulled on my emotional heartstrings a lot yet I'm excited for what's to come. #Thanosforpresident"
5647,"After 11 years and with 22 films being released in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Endgame reaches a satisfying and emotionally gut-wrenching conclusion that delivers a larger spectrum of heartbreaking, superb, and thrilling stakes and twists, combined with every powerful performances within the entire ensemble cast, a wide-ranging display of emotions and depth, a masterstroke screenplay, storytelling and direction, a suspenseful and thrilling musical score, and a coherent and nuanced visual effects, sound design, pacing and editing.

5651,I have never cried watching any kind of movie ever but Avengers Endgame touched me deeply in my heart. This movie is everything you want and more. PS: There are no post credit scenes in this movie but pay respect to everyone who made this movie happen.
5652,"DC can't even chase the tail of the Marvel, anyone who left a bad comment of this movie must be someone meant to do so, it reminds me 11years ago when I was a kid and watched the first movie of iron man I was attracted by MCU with those wonderful imagination and heroism. This is the best endgame for all these 11years of love I can not explain how I am feeling with my poor English, but this for sure is the best marvel movie ever."
5653,"No need for a long article. There wasn't enough action, drama and comedy. A mediocre final movie"
5654,"I don't understand why people give 10/10 ? cuz of drama ? it's avengers not shawshank i expected a real plan against thanos but time travel ? it's like they tried to write a thanos plan but they failed so they said "" okay let's do time travel "". gg wp"
5655,This movie is the best movie ever made and most epic! Cannot describe it better! A must watch 3000 times!
5656,You literally should watch every other movie before this.
5657,This guy is a horrible actor and ruins the whole experience
5658,"With last year's semi-cliffhanger, Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019) had a lot of ground to cover to reach a satisfying conclusion of over ten years of filmmaking. It's no wonder that it's just a smidge over three hours since there's a lot of ground to cover here. I'll admit that the only instantiations of these superheroes that I'm familiar with is via the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Still, it was probably better to go into the finale this way, having no preconceived notions of how the characters should act or the lore they're connected to in the comic books.[換行字元][換行字元]For a three-hour movie, Endgame moves at a steady pace that accelerates toward the inevitable conclusion. Following a standard three-act structure, Endgame benefited from bringing all the heroes together in Infinity War and establishing a baseline to work from and a goal to work toward. It was nice to see how each of these characters handled such a dramatic universal event. This is even to the point where some of the character transformations were quite hilarious (Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk is still a gem of the series). With the stakes already established, the collection of heroes felt like they were actually fighting for something instead of just reacting to actions thrust upon them.[換行字元][換行字元]While this film lived up to my expectations, a few scenes were far from perfect. In particular, a scene or two felt like it was pandering to the audience and saying, ""Look how progressive we are!"" Sure, it was a neat bit and combined somewhat well with all the other amazing bits around it, but I almost had to groan at how forced it seemed. At the very least, Endgame wrapped up a ton of loose ends that have spanned a multitude of movies and left a definitive conclusion to the most ambitious filmmaking event of a generation.[換行字元][換行字元]A fitting and almost perfect end to an epic saga, I give Avengers: Endgame 4.5 stars out of 5."
5659,3 hours sitting in movie theatre were definitely worthy. I enjoyed the whole movie and was sad at the same time for saying goodbye to familiar characters.
5660,I personally preferred most of the other movies. It was just way too predictable and not that funny.
5661,The whole movie gave me goosebumps. It is just amazing.
5662,The plot twists are satisfying and got a roller coaster emotions throughout the movie. The ending is not predictable at all. Now i feel empty after watching this movie. Damn.
5663,"What began back in 2008 with Iron Man has grown in to this fully matured universe with excitement, awe, thrills and sadness, and finally it must come to its endgame. (Pun intended)[換行字元][換行字元]From the start of the movie you're immediately reminded of the ending of Infinity War, thrust in to the affects of Thanos' snap, from this moment on the emotional ride begins. The movie manages to perfectly balance the action, plot moments, character arcs and character conclusions, and paces you along the way. From the get-go, you think you have this all figured out, what's going to happen but most of you will be wrong.[換行字元][換行字元]The Russo brothers manages to bring this heavily invested universe to a close in what could be considered the greatest Marvel film to date with the largest ever assembled cast. I cannot recommend you see this just once however, the 3 hour run-time that this movies demands is warranted and satisfying but make sure you go to the toilet just before you watch it.[換行字元][換行字元]And just to save you the time; this movie (fittingly) has NO after credits or mid credits scene.[換行字元][換行字元]Enjoy!"
5664,"I only do movie reviews if I either hate'm or love'm. This was in between, and I'm only reviewing it cuz it was a wrap-up of Stan Lee's Avenger series, where they do a mash-up of many of his super heroes like Iron Man, Thor, etc. And what a wrap-up this was.[換行字元][換行字元]EASILY could have been a trilogy or quadrilogy, but nope: this was a LONG movie to watch (3 hours). Took me three nights.[換行字元][換行字元]Quite a lineup of famous actors whom I like: Jeremy Renner, Benedict Cumberbatch, Zoe Saldana, and a few older ones thrown in like Michael Douglas, Rene Russo, William Hurt. Then of course there's Robert Downey Jr. with his sarcastic wit.[換行字元][換行字元]At 356 million clams, it's one of the most expensive films ever made. No doubt: I lost count of the scores of digital artists (ya, lotsa CGI)... must be over 1,000. Quite a thrill to watch, though you may need to absorb it in more than one sitting.[換行字元][換行字元]8 outa 10."
5665,I wont spoil it but this was the perfect ending to the series. I watched the first Iron Man in theaters and every Marvel movie since then I've watched in theaters. 11 years later and this ending was satisfying and perfect. Me and my husband both cried
5666,"You will see people giving this movie negative reviews and comparing it to Infinity Wars. Stating things like it doesn't come close to it and that the plot is lazy with holes in it. These are individuals that either didn't watch every movie leading up to End Game or did and didn't grasp everything they saw.[換行字元][換行字元]This was going to be very different from Infinity Wars cause it had to be. You can't have the same demeanor in a film after Thanos wipes out half the population. They took the tone from the end of infinity wars and did a great job of moving it into End Game. If you didn't watch or understand the concepts in both Antman movies you will not understand how they tied everything together in Endgame. I have a feeling that a lot of the complainers are in that boat.[換行字元][換行字元]Perfectly emotional for those who have dedicated the time into the previous 21 films. And the perfect way to end an era of movies that started in 2008. Great action and CGI, along with the comic book feel that you expect with from Marvel."
5667,"Beginning was great, ending was great, I barely stayed awake in the middle."
5668,"Infinity war : 2h 40m (perfect fight scene, didn't show how they got Power Stone & Reality Stone) Endgame : 3h 2m ( last fight is epic, the perfect ending ) RIP two legends: Tony Stark & THANOS I became a fan of THANOS ""the best character ever shown in the history of cinemas"" he has 1: Power 2: Intelligence 3: Emotion but he never wanted to rule the world, that makes him the best character ever."
5669,"A great way to close a chapter of the MCU. From beginning to end, was amazing and emotional. Three hours never went by so fast"
5670,I have no words. A perfect ending to an amazing journey for over 10 years. Russo Brothers delivers yet again and with an absolutely epic battle.
5671,"I've never felt the things I felt while watching this movie...i was in awe from beginning to end, ever since I was a kid I was dying to see something like this on the big screen and it blew me away!!! I can't WAIT auto see this again!!! Favorite movie of all time"
5672,"Some things if done better would have made this movie top 10 of all time and easily. I had great fun watching this movie.its a job well done.deserves to break all records.it has everything. So for all normal people out there looking to enjoy 3 hours of their lives, can't think of a better way specially if you like movies.defintely one of the most entertaining movies I watched in my entire life."
5673,"The anticipated sequel to Avengers: Infinity War and we're truly in the Endgame now. Having a three hour movie made the directors make the best movie they could, it's an emotional road as the cast and crew had teased but it's handled well, with the help of humor as Marvel is known for but keeping the serious and gritty tone of it all as it shouldn't be a happy movie. It starts off slow paced but thanks to the cast and writing crew we get some of MCU's best drama, with the long running time we get to see multiple of character arcs, great ones at that and it's mostly because of the directors and writers as they know the characters inside and out. There wasn't as much visual or special effects in this movie than Infinity War but the effects were fantastic.[換行字元][換行字元]The ensemble cast is not as large as in Infinity War but it is what I personally found great with it as we get to really delve into the characters, seeing and feeling their emotions. They all just have so much chemistry, the whole ensemble and it's because of the friendship and all years of working together, it's what ultimately makes the movie the great movie that it is, the characters and actors playing them. There is so many great moments in this movie, character moments and just Easter eggs and nods to past movies, there's something for everyone that will make you fanboy as it's in a way a love letter to the characters. Almost all characters have been developed so carefully and perfect it's just a blessing to see them in this movie, simply stunning work to everyone that's worked on making the characters and MCU work. Strongest acting was from Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson, their performances are some of the franchise's best. To finish off the review I'm going to rate the final battle, it's amazing in so many ways. Shot and edited with perfection."
5674,Wonderful closing of this world! We will only understand after watching 21 movies! But then it's a great experience! Thanks to the whole movie crew!
5675,The best ending to finalize the mcu sequels. Love everything about it.
5676,I belive that ... the best movie is coming and i so many time wait for it i love All the charachtars in this movie it will became the best movie for ever
5677,"Well. Where do you even begin with this one. Obviously I love the movie. Infinity war was amazing, and the expectations were very high for endgame. To me they delivered big time. The way the movie made the characters arcs come full circle, with the previous movies. And the funny Easter eggs only a marvel fan who has seen the previous MCU films. The tone of the film is very dark, much darker than infinity war, which was a very colorful action packed movie. Endgame has very dark lighting. The depressed feeling the movie has the first half, is very effective. THE HEROES LOST. It's interesting, to see that side of a superhero story. The acting is amazing in the film. It's filled with surprises. And the set ups from the previous films pay off very well. I had a very cathartic experience watching the movie. Obviously it was very sad a times. And the whole experience felt like a big ending. Even though more MCU films will come in the future. This was definitely an end of a 10 year era. I highly recommend this movie to every marvel fan! Even though everyone in the world has seen the movie pretty much. I can't wait for it to come out on Blu-ray so I can watch it many more times! One of the coolest most unique experiences I have ever had in a movie theater. I have witnessed history."
5678,That's it. That's it. Thats it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Thats it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Thats it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Thats it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Thats it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Thats it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Thats it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Thats it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Thats it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Thats it. That's it.
5679,"The movie covers 11 years, 22 movies. Beautifully sewn together. Long but completely necessary. A masterpiece."
5680,"It was ok. Kinda dragged, felt a little hamfisted at times, was extremely deliberate, and the ""solution"" felt contrived and far too easily stumbled upon. I know people are going to give this movie great reviews because they're huge marvel fans or whatever, but looked at objectively, it's just kinda ok."
5681,What a film been waiting and talking about it for a year and what a wait was perfect
5682,"I am immensely honoured to be existing in this monumental era of time to be able to experience the vast complexity and extravagance of the MCU, as it flourished with each subsequent film. It has been one hell of a ride, but unfortunately - all good things must come to an end... and this film met this end with great success."
5683,"There is no way to describe my emotions for that movie , Oh i love it very much , Best 3 hours in marvel's movie , I can't think that there is someone perfect for tony stark, Iron Man except Robert Downey Jr. he was in a great performance for their character and everyone was perfect I really love that movie but I will give it a 9.5/10 , I really loved infinity war more but this was an epic movie , part of the journey is the end , I love you 3000 Iron Man Thank you Marvel (:"
5684,Nothing can prepare you for this. A perfect ending and incredible story.
5685,Avengers Endgame Is Packed With Lots Of Secrets Amazing Scens. I cant Tell Anything I'm speechless They Just nailed it.
5686,"Endgame, finally brings a conclusion to the whole infinity war but in dissapointing fashion, parts of the film were amazing, some hilarious and others just meh. People appearing out of literally nowhere compared to where others appear from is confusing and looks ut of place. on general the whole plot line is great, but the way in which its presented compared to the previous titles is dissapointing. RIP to the hero(s) that died and will not return. may the next bunch of movies look forwards in a positive fashion."
5687,"I'm A HUGE fan of the MCU but I'm not sure if the movie was bad or my expectations were too high. I found myself tapping my fingers and looking around the theater to find that others were bored as well.[換行字元][換行字元]Honestly, the third act was more like previous MCU movies but it dragged getting there. This could have been a much shorter movie while maintaining the story and keeping fans from getting bored."
5688,"After following the Marvel films for more than 10 years, it was a beautiful 'end'. The movie starts with a slow paced emotional tone and catches speed as the story goes on. Some of the goodbyes given to the main characters were heart touching while others were heartbreaking."
5689,"Russo Brothers gave the GENERAL audience exactly what they wanted. I would've not changed a thing to make the money they did. But if I had the talent of a Martin S. or Christopher N. this would have been better than infinity war (which was amazing!!). Cookie cutter storyline with untimely comedy. Too much comedic relief with poor dialogue and horrible storyline. Thanos seems to be a typical bad guy whereas in infinity war there was much depth to him...you could almost sympathize with him. A lot of Easter eggs if you like them. If youre a sheep you will love this movie. If you think for yourself and looking for a rich cinematic storyline that can keep you focused, this film would give the same enjoyment as Toy Story"
5690,"Perhaps one of the best, even the best movie I have ever seen!"
5691,"Like so many other fans of the MCU I was eagerly awaiting the release of Avengers Endgame, but the thing is up until it was released I had imagined a few scenarios on how the movies may have started and also how it may have ended with plenty in between and I have to say I think not only would my plot of also stuck with the theme of what was trying to be achieved with Endgame, I think it would have been so much better.[換行字元][換行字元]I watched the movie at the Vue cinema in Islington London 20:05 showing screen 9 which is their largest screen I believe. It was more or less a full house. Throughout the film there was a lot of laughter from the audience, quite a lot in fact as well as those folks who seem to laugh out load just for the sheer sake of almost wanting to laugh to validate to themselves this is why they couldn't wait to wait this movie. The thing is, personally I wanted more than to laugh which I did do. What I really wanted was that 'wow..what the hell' with my eyes absolutely glued to the screen holding by breath moments. For me this never transpired but it had all the tools and the opportunities to have been able to do so. At the end of the Avengers Endgame I wanted to see if there would be a genuine round of applause in the auditorium from the majority of the audience, and as I expected this never occurred. There were some applauds but that felt more like applause from those who just wanted to lead the start of what they expected would be for the entire audience to join in... and sadly that was never going to happen with Endgames.[換行字元][換行字元]Maybe it's me but I just figured that for a movie which is 3hrs long with everything it has it would have been able to surpass Infinity War in terms of possible repeat viewings, and that I definitely don't think will be the case for me once all the excitement truly dies down. I will want to watch this again when it available to buy, but Infinity War will then continue to be my goto film out of these two in the End.[換行字元][換行字元]I can't help but think sentiment to the MCU as well as Endgame being the final chapter of an eagerly waited watch will allow for really high ratings. I also acknowledge that we all have different taste in movies, but this is MCU and we probably all have a fairly general taste at the least to what we've been able to enjoy over the last 11 years.[換行字元][換行字元]I would like to thank all who were involve with MCU for what they have treated everyone too over these years."
5692,This movie is so cool but i can understand why people are dissappointed but the problem is that the people are just trying to bring the movie down and not giving it what rating it deserves and you cant say it wasnt good
5693,"Just perfection, in every detail. Could not have been more satisfied"
5694,"On one hand, this was to be much respected for the approach it took, and yet on another, all of the time-traveling becomes kind of messy and convvoluted."
5695,"Avengers Endgame is the culmination of 21 Marvel movies over 11 years and there can not be a better ending than this. What a befitting end to an incredible journey. The Dark Knight was the best comic movie ever made but now Endgame shares the top spot with it and it definitely deserves it.[換行字元][換行字元]The Russo's have upped the ante with their last outing, Infinity War and raised the bar for this so high. Boy did they do it better this time. The writing, directing and acting is incredible. With so many characters and superheroes, each one of them gets a chance to shine which is not an easy feat but the writers managed to do it.[換行字元][換行字元]This is a 3 hour long movie but I didn't feel bored for a second. Such was the writing and direction. It has drama, humour, emotions, kinetic action and visual extravaganza. No spoilers, but towards the end of the movie all the super heroes from MCU come together and it is an absolute heart-stopping moment when Captain America says ""Avengers assemble"".[換行字元][換行字元]The movie is going to leave you laughing, surprised and shocking by some twists, posibbly gasping and screaming. The ending is gonna make you emotional but you will leave the theater with a satisfying smile.[換行字元][換行字元]Kudos to the Russo's, writers, Kevin Fiege and the entire Marvel team for this. Just go watch the movie and you will not be disappointed."
5696,"This movie is everything ,,, I loved it ,, worth watching more than once .. I think it's probavly the best marvel movie to date ,,, my only concern was we were missing the Fantastic Four and X men but overall ,, I'm a fan for life .."
5697,"It's a great movie, though. But it is over-rated. The first hour is sleepy and boring. And the final battle isn't as sensational as Infinity War."
5698,"I loved it!! It lived up to the hype. The marvel universe fans like me won't be disappointed. Everything is amazing, they really outdid themselves. There has to be more! Has to be! Have Deadpool and Wolverine and the X-men join the next films. I'm sure they will make more as they can't let their cash cow go into a famine. I'm sure they will keep riding the bum rush forever!"
5699,"An interesting film and quite successful conclusion to the story with all the main and third-party hero lines involved to this point. But there are two minuses: soooooo boring and unnecessary stretching of dialogues and meaningful looks at each other which stretch the film even more... and a completely artificial looking drama where they tried to show it, especially with inappropriate jokes that are considered normal for Marvel's films in another situation, but at this drama they spoil it additionally. However, this does not spoil the overall impression of the film, which I was pleased with."
5700,Great to see heroes together fighting. Thanos tge mighty villain had his times but how the cinematography was absolutely brilliant
5701,"All I can say about this film, is that it is not only the best superhero movie of all time, but, it is also one of the most cinematic achievements to be put on screen. This film is a certified masterpiece. Thanks for the long ride Marvel, and i can't wait for what's next."
5702,"This isn't just hype! This movie proved everything is possible. The Russo's Brothers did an astonishing work closing this 10 year saga, and it couldn't be more perfect than this. They and Marvel knew they couldn't screw this up, and Oh My... This is everything a fan of this saga can hope for and so much more. I still have no words that can describe this movie more than incredible, astonishing, incredible, perfect. This is the finale we needed and they sure delivered. It comes full circle, and that's what makes it even more touching and so real in so many ways, it's a superhero movie, yet the way it's so grounded is unbelievable. A closure that not every movie/writer/producer can pull of."
5703,"Watch this movie again and again, really why NOT? From the 1967 animated SpiderMan series through to Avengers-Endgame all I can say is thank you STAN LEE! I as.many of us do consider myself a True Believer! No matter the technology and quality of scripts hat the times might have afforded and no matter my age there is always a giddiness about watching MARVEL SUPERHEROS on the screen! Animated or live action I can always find myself being transported back to my 12yr old self. So love it or hate it just remember that feeling when you first discovered the MARVEL UNIVERSE! EXCELSIOR!"
5704,"Truly amazing, i love how it was done in three parts. Act one dealing with the loss, act two getting the team and plan together and act three all out brawl for redemption!!!"
5705,"Some people probably will disappointed on Endgame since this movie is not ""Infinity War"" kind of film. The movie was slow but it didn't bored me. The tone is way different from previous Marvel movies. The avengers are suffered, and this tells us how they deal with it. In some scene, i knew something was going to happen, but in a good way which means i like it. And also there's a lot of things i didn't see coming and it shocked me. The movie knows when you should cry, laugh and be like ""wow!!!"". They gave all of them in the right moments. Off course this movie has flaws but they didn't really bother me. I can't say anything else without spoiling anything. What a satisfying conclusion."
5706,"The story that has been culminating for the last 11 years has come to a satisfying end. The characters had their due and progressed out of phase 3 gracefully and purposefully. The characters i speak of had the end that they all deserved and what i thought was expected. i know these characters from the books really well and they behaved true to form on all fronts. Nothing really seemed forced and it felt like a natural progression. That being said the story was EPIC and yet it seemed everyone that needed it had their screen time which is a master stroke and very difficult to do but the Russo's pulled it off. My wife welled up with tears Three time and she never does this at movies let alone a comic book movie. She turned to me and said ""what is wrong with me i am about the cry again"" to this I just smiled. MY WIFE CRIED IN A COMIC BOOK MOVIE. 'NUFF SAID !"
5707,"If you don't want to cry so much while you are watching the movie, as there are some scenes that really broke my heart, maybe watch some spoilers can help you better taking in the final result."
5708,"Simple movie and weird. End Game? Seriously? Looks like how "" End"" //"
5709,We know this most best selling movie of all time... im already watching this movie more than 2 time... and never get bored
5710,Many of the 1/10 reviews or people that say infinity war is better is the people who don't understand most of what is happening or haven't seen all of the marvel films or have not read any marvel comics. Endgame is a true treat for hardcore fans such as I am as I have seen every marvel movie and have read many of the comics. It is full of satisfying scenes that have references to other marvel movies so the people that say endgame is a waste of time don't understand the references to older movies. Endgame is one of those movies where you really have to watch previous movies to find it fun. If you have not seen all or most of the marvel movies or have not read any comics you will feel bored and confused of the plot as most of the movie is fan service to marvel fans which is a 3 hour special with all characters from every marvel movie which will satisfy true marvel fans.
5711,"A box office success, sure, not based on its merits though but rather that of its predecessors. Visually spectacular as we've come to expect from the Avengers franchise (and the only reason for the stars) otherwise unnecessarily long, bordering on boring and full of plot holes. A few endearing scenes and one major scene were the only semi-redeeming factors. Otherwise just SO SO disappointing **SOB**"
5712,"No comment needed.[換行字元][換行字元]Best MCU ever. Chris Evans i love you. Robert downey jr you're da bomb. Chris Hemsworth. Scharlett johanson, she is my spirit animal."
5713,"It's an emotional journey as emotions takes the centerstage and is the soul of the movie while action takes the backseat...its fun filled with loads of laughter, galore of surprises, it's not about superheroes just clad with their armour and swinging weapons; for a change, all through, we get to see them as normal human characters fighting their inner emotions and external evil at the same time...[換行字元][換行字元]A befitting tribute to all of its predecessors, AEG might not be everyone's cup of tea...for those who love MCU, this one's going to be an unforgettable experience for this lifetime as there might not be another one that might repeat this magic again...not for this lifetime atleast![換行字元][換行字元]Bye Bye!

5716,"EndGame is an epic finale to one of the greatest infinity saga. God the movie is fantastic!!! I laughed, i cried and i cheered for the movie. I wont write much or spoilers would come out of my mouth. Its all what marvel fans have been waiting for. I will write another review after Monday so that my review can be filled with Spoilers!!!"
5717,"I don't even know how many times I said ""you are KIDDING ME!"" out loud, in the theater! It was a LOT of movie for the price of the tickets. So much closure, so many laughs, and also some tears. I don't think any movie will ever be as worth seeing ever again. Thank you, Marvel, for an incredible story. Just perfect."

5719,"I haven't really been a fan of many of the marvel movies but gave this one a shot given all the hype. Total waste of three hours. The time travel, plot holes and cheesy death scenes all were too confusing. These movies have consistently pandered to its audiences and this one was no different. If anything it was worse."
5720,"Amazed...this last ride was incredible!! The story line was amazing, it dove deep into the characters persona. What a great way to close it out!!"
5721,"As all of you have been, I've been waiting for this movie for a long long time. We've all had our expectations set high, and let me just say you could not see anything coming your way. Avengers Endgame is the perfect culmination of the eleven years of movies Marvel has given us, perfectly balanced, as all things should be. You're gonna cry, you're gonna laugh, you're gonna be surprised. Solid 10/10."
5722,The most satisfying end to a saga that has captivated our imagination for the last 21 years.
5723,"I dont know how to call it... a perfection?? no it wasnt, it has some obvious mistakes that we can easily point out... an all action-packed movie?? um.. kinda, not too much imo.. IMO i repeat.. but that was.. kinda enough for me... and for what im gonna say next... It was a satisfaction! everything you expect from comic, everything you want to be here, and you wanna be satisfied, it will be. It was so good that made some people in my cinema laughed so hard and then cried out loud for some moments... perhaps for them it was all about memories... it has been 11 years after all you know So, if you are still waiting for someone to pick you up for this movie, or if you are still looking for someone to watch it together with you.. I suggest you something.. WHATEVER IT TAKES !"
5724,"Firstly, when i heard that the movie is 3 hours i was upset But when i saw the movie i had the greatest moments ever"
5725,Best comic book movie ever.you can watch the movie more than one time.
5726,"It was normal movie but captain marvel ruined it. She was, very overpowered and she was strongest character. Adding her in this movie was very big mistake plot was coll tho but it wqs ruined by capitan marvel"
5727,"I have waited this movie for a year, and it doesn't let me down. Looking forward to the next 10 years!"
5728,"You know a film is good when it manages to make three hours absolutely fly by. 'Avengers: Endgame' does this in spades, making its gargantuan run-time seem as fast as a snap of the fingers. While it is properly pacy, this doesn't mean that it's a constantly moving, action driven piece in the same vein as its predecessor 'Avengers: Infinity War' (2018). Instead, it's a much more character focussed, dramatic film and in my eyes it's all the better for it. While 'Infinity War' was great in its own right, 'Endgame' feels like a completely different beast all together; the two are undeniably separate entities. The characters have always been what makes the MCU stand out and 'Endgame' arguably has the best character work in one of these films to date. Rather unusually for a picture of this ilk, it is focussed more on that than any action or spectacle, both completing arcs from the entire franchise and establishing new ones in itself. Each of the core players are focussed upon greatly here, which is extremely involving, especially to long-time fans of the series. That's not to say that the film is devoid of any action at all though; it comes eventually and is very much worth the wait. The third act action sequence is probably the most satisfying moment of the entire franchise and proves that Marvel knows how to stage these things very well, while still keeping a keen focus on character. There's also a lot of fan service throughout, but this hardly a bad thing at all. Being able to reference even the lesser known and liked films of the franchise and trust that the majority of the audience will be able to understand is something that Marvel wears with pride here. 'Endgame' is for the fans after all and it never forgets this, yet (unlike 'Infinity War') there's enough groundwork laid out here to make it really work on its own as an individual story, too. Overall, it's an outstanding conclusion to the 'Infinity Saga', satisfyingly wrapping everything up, making it feel like a definitive 'end', yet still leaving you excited for what's to come (the MCU isn't going anywhere any time soon). It's big-budget blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best and one of the greatest Marvel films to date. 9/10"
5729,"Exceeded all ecpectations. Pissed on all the rumors, destoyed all competition. Greatest movie ever made."
5730,"The first 2 hours were extreemly prolonged, and i couldn't get engaged in the story what so ever. However the last 1 hour was absolutley superb, especially as someone who has seen every MCU movie and TV show (including the Hulu and Netflix shows)"
5731,This film only bad thing is that they don't answer all questions
5732,"There was parts where ,because of the screaming in the theater, I couldn't hear myself think. Oh wait that might have been me. At times i found myself thinking ' ten movies ago they knew they were going to bring this or that back,no freaking way. Sometimes covered in goosebumps, sometimes with tears this movie did what i thought couldn't be done It exceeded the expectations By a lot"
5733,How is this a good movie? I don't know. Story is very predictable. Jokes are not funny. I liked the other movies but this is one just bullsh**. Simple entertainment and not the best movie of the year.

BTW keep your tissues handy!!"
5735,"This is the best crossover I have ever see. I had so many emotion with this that I couldn't believe my eyes, I was crying with this movie. I won't never forget this movie."
5736,"Anthony and Joe Russo have yet again pulled it off in what stands as one of the better pictures we've seen through the franchise.[換行字元][換行字元]The story takes its time showing the aftermath of ""Avengers: Infinity War"", and what a take-off.

But in ""Endgame"", he was portrayed as much more of a standard sadistic maniac. (2) the time-travel setup, which did not work convincingly for me, and insignifies many past events in the franchise.[換行字元][換行字元]But still, I think an excellent conclusion to the Infinity Saga."
5737,"If i had to give out spoiler about ENDGAME, i only have 3 words to describe it , Blood, Sweet and Tears! This movie really deserves the hype, all of the attention it got in these past 3 months. So unpredictable, exceeds our expectations. A supremely epic ENDGAME to a decade of MCU's infinity saga. Without doubt, i'll give my 10 of 10 to it 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽"
5738,It's perfect. I have watched all the Marvel movies. It's a really fantastic ending. I feel so sad..........
5739,At the beginning just nothing special totally no need 3 hours for the movie....
5740,Gonna be honest. This has to be one of the best movies of all time. One thing I liked is that you have to have seen the other movies before this. Just to make sure you have your facts right. It brings you back to the first Iron Man. It is amazing. AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COST!!
5741,The interactions between the characters were extremely entertaining with clever dialogue and convincing acting. This added a much needed dose of positivity to a very negative situation.[換行字元][換行字元]The action was deliberately paced for easy viewing and very well choreographed. Made more beautiful by the special effects and living locations into marvellous chaos!
5742,This is a good movie. But it could have been better. It has great acting. It also has a good story line. It is not a great story line mind you. The Avengers age of Ultron is mush better.
5743,No words to describe. This movie exceed your expectation!!!!
5744,"I won't spoil the movie....[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame is terribly paced with actions that exist only to further the plot. Most character development is told to the audience instead of experienced. The movie breaks its own stated rules and character scaling makes no sense.[換行字元][換行字元]If you turn off your brain and stop asking questions of what is transpiring on screen, then yes you will enjoy the movie.[換行字元][換行字元]But if you ask even one question, you will become terribly frustrated and taken out of the movie. A film, no matter how fanciful, should suspend disbelief speaking to either real world logic or the logic it establishes in its own narrative. There is none of that, characters survive and perform actions only for spectacle and because it serves the whims of the writer not the story.[換行字元][換行字元]Fans frankly deserve better."
5745,"If you thought Avengers Infinity War was the best Marvel had to offer, think again. Marvel ups their game by several notches in this movie. It's the perfect movie for the ending of a saga of Marvel movies. It's three hours of pure joy excitement and enthusiasm"
5746,It ended a great story in a great way. It was perfect from the start to the end. I didn't think that Marvel could make a better movie than Infinity War but here we are. Thank you for this great movie Marvel. Best movie ever.
5747,"Edge of your seat stuff, with the added goosebumps for the final fight scene."
5748,"Its perfection. ""I knew it !"" Its the best MCEU movie till date."

5750,This has to be the greatest superhero movies ever made!!!! The three hours disappeared but by the end I was left totally satisfied I cried I laughed and cried again this was a true masterpiece great job
5751,"Not every highly-anticipated movie lives up to the expectations but Avengers: Endgame is one of those few that delivered almost everything that's been promised or to some extent, even more. Not only this is the perfect follow up to INFINITY WAR (2018) but a remarkably done, moving homage to a 10 year long successful franchise consisting 21 films![換行字元][換行字元]While the first hour & so skillfully sets up the high-stakes, gradually reveals the remaining avengers in an utterly emotionally wounded & frustrated post Infinity War world, the film cleverly picks up the momentum right after that with lots of twists & turns backed up by little & big moments of excitements as well as tears of joy & heart-pounding loss at the end.[換行字元][換行字元]Kudos to the director-duo Russo brothers, the writers and everyone involved with this absolute epic conclusion of the saga that ultimately pulled off the most satisfying ending this whole story arc could have.[換行字元][換行字元]Can't figure at the moment how they or anyone will be able to top this one in coming years."
5752,"8 for the movie itself, 10 for the feeling it gives."
5753,"It was an excellent movies that combine all of marvel superheroes into one. Special effect that even better than movie last year infinity war, and also a very good closing to end this infinity saga."

Because I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.""[換行字元][換行字元]So spoke Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to Captain America (Chris Evans) in the opening act of Avengers: Endgame. Quite poetically, leading into this crossover event, the above interaction no doubt reflects the minds of all Marvel fans flooding to see Endgame in the coming weeks.

Now, the Avengers must unite one more time to reverse this grave catastrophe, ""whatever it takes.""[換行字元][換行字元]So, has Marvel managed to make this overwhelmingly ambitious project ""work""? The short answer: yes. Infinite times over, yes. Avengers: Endgame is not only a truly engrossing culmination to the 'Infinity Saga', it is also nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece.[換行字元][換行字元]The journey that began with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in Iron Man back in 2008 is very intelligently tied up in Endgame. As the film unfolds, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's meticulous story planning becomes evident and gradually proves to be the most satisfying payoff any Marvel fan could have hoped for. Marvel President Kevin Feige alongside directors Anthony and Joe Russo have completed an impossible feat; Endgame is humorous, heart-breaking and perpetually captivating. It more than exceeds any presupposition laid before it with a swagger more equanimous than Stark's ego, whilst also moulding an open route forward for the inevitable continuation of this formidable franchise. It's one-of-a-kind experience; the perfect milestone to end this gigantic adventure, yet a glorious beginning for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame's greatest filmic achievement though, lies in its steady pace and indulgent narrative; taking things slow but never wasting time, yet speeding along whilst never rushing, everything fits perfectly into place in this 3-hour work of genius with a sophistication indicative of a Francis Ford Coppola paragon. Sure, it's a high-budget superhero blockbuster featuring spectacular special effects, but as Marvel has proven before, that doesn't mean a superhero film cannot tackle tones and styles not necessarily affiliated with the genre. In the realisation of its ambition, Endgame catapults the superhero genre to an unprecedented spectrum of film accomplishment; it is quite frankly a piece of cinematic art, encapsulating yet conquering all that has come before it with majesty and self-assuredness.[換行字元][換行字元]But as noted by Stark, ""part of the journey is the end"", and now the curtain draws on this dazzling superhero adventure. Though the encore of 'Phase Three' is yet to be seen in Spider-Man: Far From Home (releasing this July), Avengers: Endgame is a magnificent finale which allows The Avengers we so know and love the opportunity to sign off in remarkable fashion, leaving behind a Hulk-sized stamp on Hollywood history which will remain for 'infinity'.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers... Assemble. And take a bow."
5756,"After all this time, after all the movies, after all the laughs and battles we finally get to witness the end to the biggest movie saga of our lifetime. Never before has an endeavor so grand been accomplished and achieved. Avengers Endgame lived up to the expectations and all hype. Per usual Marvel form Wndgame provided a wonderful story filled with action, plenty of laughs and more stars than we could keep track of. This movie gave me chills and had me wondering what would happen next. I know phase four of the MCU is in our future but this culmination of over 10 years of movies was the pinnacle for me. I doubt Marvel will be able to top this story. I won't be spoiling anything here but just know there will be plenty of laughs, tears and tense moments. It's a fantastic ending to the Avengers story. Or is it?? Can't wait to see what comes next."
5757,"This movie deserve to be the best! I was crying to this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]I thought I knew Where Marvel was taking us, But... Well, lets just say, no one exspected what happend in this movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Simply just a masterpiece!"
5758,Never Thought a day like This would Come.. When i Recall Those nostalgic memories .. Thanks For This Era Im Lucky i got to live in it. Avengers Forever
5759,"I know this is different from marvel END GAME, LORD OF THE RINGS FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. You only see maybe like 30-40 seconds of a large scale battle with this large scale of a train rolling battle in the end game is way better then fellowship of the ring."
5760,I enjoyed every second of it. It was a great experience to watch a 3h movie. I will watch it again and again. But unfortunately nothing is perfect. I gave it 8 out of 10 just for one reason. Some characters deserve more time to show there best in there role.
5761,I'll keep it simple. I'd find it very difficult to score less than 10. Mammoth effort in filmmaking. I almost want MCU to call time because anything else will surely be an anticlimax.
5762,"It was very slow at many parts of the movie, many of them unnecessary and there were many things that was left unexplained. I felt they the movie was directed to the new marvel fans and didn't give us marvel veterans the fan service we wanted. It was a rather good comedy, but the action that I was expecting was lacking. The was put out to be appealing towards society and media, and not to us fans of the series.[換行字元][換行字元]I feel betrayed, but understand why it ended up like this. I get why people would enjoy it, but I didn't. This is the avengers, and therefore it is definitely a must-see, just not as great as it was expected.."
5763,Marvel Dc abartiliyor. Filmde bir sürü mantik hatasi vardi. Her marvel filminde oldugu gibi.
5764,"People might say that the film disappointing and the action scenes were limited, etc from the reviews i've read. the thing is, this movie is really one of the most emotional marvel movies i've ever seen. it's about family, friendship, love, sacrifice, and etc. you definitely have to watch it, because everything you've seen in the past 10 years will lead and be here and you sure don't want to miss it as a marvel fan. also prepare your tissue because there were a lot of minor scenes that even touching."
5765,A very much fantastic movie. Best marvel creation hands down. So emotion so humor so much in a movie. Even a non marvel-fan would feel this movie. Damn good it is!
5766,"This movie is everything we needed, comedy, emotional, u name it. A great ending to a series. (there were some parts which are questionable)"
5767,Great work from all actors .. alot of emotions we laughed alot and confused alot and finally we was very happy for this work thanks alot marvel
5768,"This movie is pure awesomeness. This is a movie, i will be remembered for eternity. Just a big thanks. Cinema was never so much entertaining. Can't wait for blu ray disk"
5769,"If you are going watch this movie, avoid spoilers.Trust me this movie is worth of every penny.I am Marvel fan from childhood.This movie is the end the legendary trio of Iron Man, Captain America Thor...I was crying in the end. I will recommend Everyone to watch this."
5770,"This is probably the highest 8/10 I could give for an 8/10 movie.[換行字元][換行字元]There are some very good moments in Endgame and that's coming from a long standing MCU fan growing up with these movies. In creating an extensive and emotional journey for a lot of the MCU characters, it absolutely succeeds.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame ultimately is an excellent conclusion to over 10 years of film but I feel the plot's pacing and direction is really lacking to Infinity War, which 'trimmed the fat' and was much more focused and energetic. Granted, Endgame takes risks but this might be a disappointment to some fans with its slower pace that focuses on character development over action and intense sequences. The run time probably should be shorter or streamlined. Less cuts and motion blur during fight scenes would've made it easier to track fights as well.[換行字元][換行字元]Respect for the Russo Brothers for taking the direction they did with Endgame and it really does satisfy but Infinity War is overall a more entertaining movie. It's not the best MCU movie but I can't dispute its great conclusion."
5771,Some beautiful character moments that cut through right to the character's core and a fantastic ode to the past ten years. Just would have liked some nuanced action.
5772,"I just have to said, thank you, to Kevin feige, to Marvel studios, to Anthony and Joe Russo, to Disney, to Robert Downey JR, to all the cast, you make this posible."
5773,"The hype that was built and created totally overshadowed the movie, and came in very subpar. Even on a technical side of things parts of the movie felt rushed, not needed, useless or not thought out at all."
5774,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has always been stuck with certain limitations, such as a formulaic three act structure, not exceeding a pg13 rating and such. However this film, being a form of climax to the saga, offers something its audience hasn't really experience, at least from Marvel. This film is more narratively complex and interesting than all its predecessors. While watching you were quite surprised as to where are characters would end up next, this kept the picture thrilling and exciting throughout. The Russo Brothers have always bent the limitations to their will by keeping a good sense of what they're actually capable of doing. These limitations are annoying cause you really are not gonna get much of a different film to the last one or the next. But limitation breeds creativity. The Russo's have completely taken advantage of that and it shows in their films in the Mcu and especially here in Avengers Endgame[換行字元][換行字元]Obviously the writers had a say in what was actually happening and they did an amazing job at balancing the characters on their journey in this film. There were various plots with various characters that needed to have interesting chemistry or connections with one another, whichever worked best for the characters. It shows how carefully they understand the characters and care for how their stories will end or where they will go, and I appreciate that a lot personally. They also took many a risk with how the character interact with the tragedies and conflicts that have faced them, most notably Iron Man, Thor and Hawkeye. Each of those characters went through tremendous change and each ended up somewhere entirely different which is truly fascinating and entirely believable. Certain bits play for broken characters that you genuinely feel terrible for and other bits play for comedy and the blance is fairly consistent. I really like how this film is very messy and chaotic but the Writers and Directors guide us through it all, it's impressive.[換行字元][換行字元]It is entirely visually stimulating across the board, the cgi is some of the best ever and very carefull done, the characters have interesting looks that change often. It's shot nicely, that hendheld look they've had in the Russos films is present and plays for certain emotional thing, for example the opening scene. There was a certain shot just after the opening titles which, with context, makes you feel really uneasy. When it comes to the ending you really feel a sense of heroism and hope from an otherwise hopeless world and certain things happen that shock and aw and they come at just the right moment. It really delivers on a satisfying climactic battle. The character remains alive in everyone throughout the climax and makes you build up excitement and care for how this could end. It's drastically enjoyable and emotional. The finality for many of the characters, when things wrap up, completely delivers. Where the last film (Infinity War) left you with a bad taste in your mouth, this one does something different entirely and allows certain characters to progress and to end. I really enjoyed this film throughout and the build up made it all worth while. Although personally I've been frustrated and unsatisfied with most of the Mcu movies I'm overly happy with this one and any of the Russo Brothers films."
5775,"We need the movie like the end of all things marvel bring to the world. Not the movie can not understand about the time travel and the last fight too boring. I was spend 3 hours of my life at the theather and told my wife: ""do you understand?"" she said: ""no"""
5776,"I am a MCU fan. Throughout the last ten years, I have watched every film expect for Captain Marvel. However, I don't like the glamor of the new MCU films. When people watch superhero films, they want to feel a connection. While the latest Avengers films was great, it felt gimmicky and was too ""Hollywoodish"" for my tastes. As the budgets keep getting bigger and better, I'm afraid the films will lose their hearts. I'm a simple woman: I like good storytelling and compelling characters. Clumping everybody in the MCU in one film is gimmicky and cheap. And if the truth was to be told, Thanos is the saving grace of Endgame. Keep the heart, Marvel!"
5777,"Best Marvel movie! The three hours went by super quick! A thoughtful super hero movie with moments of laughter, sadness, and action all mixed in."
5778,"This is one of the best conclusions to one of the biggest cinematic ensembles of all time; it couldn't have been done better. This movie really encapsulates everything that the story of the Avengers and the various MCU solo character movies, have been leading up to. Not only was it the most anticipated film over the past few years, but also a story line that comic fans have dreamed to see on the big screen. What's great about it is it picks up right where Avengers: Infinity War left off. It was a trip through memory lane for viewers like me; comic book geeks. If you're like me and love the Marvel Comics, this is certainly for you. It includes many other comic book story lines from several different comic issues. Even though it is a superhero film, it is also a very great drama movie, because of the character conflicts and story developments. This movie is ultimately, really Iron Man and Captain America's story and how they have evolved and changed as characters since their first solo films.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie starts off slow, but understandably so. The first act of the movie is really picking up where we left off and moving the character development and story forward. It isn't until about an hour and a half in when we start seeing action. However, the end fight scene is not only spectacular but one of the grandest fights in all of cinema. With twists and turns you always keep wondering if Thanos is going to get the gauntlet again or how they are going to stop him.[換行字元][換行字元]If you are looking for an entertaining movie for the family, Avengers: Endgame is a great rainy day film. It's exciting, enticing and was mind-numbingly awesome."
5779,"It's all I have to say, because I might bring out spoilers. It's the best movie Marvel has ever ever made!"
5780,"Avengers: Endgame was simply superhero perfection that was so worth all those Marvel movies. The storylines and action didn't disappoint at all that it had me at the edge of my seat every single second. Avengers: Endgame is not only a movie that Marvel fans should be proud of but it is one that Stan Lee would be damn proud of, no doubt. Simply amazing movie from Marvel."
5781,"I don't want to describe how I'm feeling after the movie. This is exactly what every MCU fans expecting. Total mixed up with Fantacy, Action , Suspense & of course comedy. Sad but loved the way the end up the film."
5782,"After 11 years, Avengers: Endgame is a truly MCU's finest hour ! This will be the most satisfying movie ever had from the MCU, and the Russo brothers dedicated everything to gives this cinematic achievement as a celebration to Marvel's brand and an epic conclusion to Infinity's Saga.[換行字元][換行字元]But with the #DontSpoilTheEndgame's trend, I suggest that you should go see the movie immediately ! The less you know, the fun and the best experience you'll have to this amazing film.[換行字元][換行字元]For me, It is such a great big film as much as The Return of the King and Ben-Hur ! (Possibly, it might be Ben-Hur to this generation too.) And as much as a superheroes film goes, I says this is the best Superheroes film of the decade (or in 2010's) that could go along with the greatness of The Dark Knight.[換行字元][換行字元]Thank you, Kevin Feige. Thank you, Joe and Anthony Russo. Thank you, to all the MCU's cast. Thank you, Disney. You guys just made a classic film for everyone and I hope Stan Lee proud on this great cinematic achievement."
5783,"Not only is it an awesome movie on its own, it makes up for movies that I felt were subpar in the MCU (Ragnarock, Ant Man & wasp, Captain Marvel) by making the events of those movies pertinent to this endgame. Truly a grand achievement! Funny, emotional and smart!"
5784,It couldnt be better than this. I enjoyed every second of this cinematography icon.
5785,Best to finish the MCU with infinity wars. This was garbage with massive plot holes and Thanos being a generic villain instead of the complex antagonist he was in infinity wars. Massive let down.
5786,"I can say is this was one of the best cinema experiences of my life. I don't think you can top the ending of this movie. My jaw was on the floor, e writhing I've ever wanted in a comic book film."
5787,"After leaving the cinema, my friends and I were in awe, discussing our very favorite parts and maybe some minor dislikes we found.[換行字元][換行字元]Personally, this movie did so many things right, it's very easy to foresee minor things that might have bothered someone. Cinematography was incredible, special effects at some moments were so good it blown my mind, actors were able to really shine with so many emotional moments. Maybe my only point which didn't hit the spot 100% was the music. Maybe I was just stunned by the movie itself that the music went by without me noticing it. That I will be able to judge after watching it again.[換行字元][換行字元]What I believe to be the biggest strength of this movie might be how many people it can reach and what it does to the viewer. One of my friends jumped in his seat at specific moments out of excitement and joy, others shared a glance at their neighbor seat with a truly ""WTF"" face and without looking directly to check, I bet some also shed a tear or two either from laughing or being emotionally hit.[換行字元][換行字元]But the one thing I'm most thankful for is one moment. I've never experienced something like this before. There was no music in this specific scene and no words were spoken, there was no sound from someone coughing, grabbing some popcorn, heck not even a single breath was to hear. It was a terrific, yet beautiful absolute silence to tribute the very moment that was shown.[換行字元][換行字元]That, I will never forget."
5788,"Truly a very satisfying film for all MCU fans, it is a film that perfectly connects most if not all the past 21 movies and is able to still please fans by adding various comic book references."
5789,"Nothing more I can really say than that this film pays homage to all the films that came before, and is the perfect end of an era. What a film and what a cast. This film is just immense 🙌🏻"
5790,"The tone of the movie is set from the very beginning. While there are the classic marvel funny moments, they do not take away from the fact that everything is lost and this is the last chance the heroes have to fix what Thanos has done."
5791,"Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe I expected more elegant & complex solutions. But what this movie gave to me was huge disappointment - with a little fun here & there (mostly includes Thor). In the end, Infinity War remained as far more better movie."
5792,"I personally have not been a fan of the avengers since the russo brothers took over. The acting in this film was like watching a middle school play. No emotion from anyone except jeremy renner and rdj. Way too long and the plot was just stupid, i think this goes to show huge budget definitely doesn't make a amazing movie."
5793,"Unoriginal, way too long, more comedy than action, outstanding special effects as usual but the story was so lame. Expected way more out of this. I wish I would have waited to watch on dvd or TBS for free!! Waste of money and time"
5794,"Being the final chapter of Avenger series expectation was very high. Especially because of the superb success of the earlier chapter, ""The Infinity War"" which was undoubtedly a joy to watch. Since the bar was set so high it was not that easy for the movie makers to surpass the hype. Thus in the final chapter makers lack the finesse . There are flaws as the movie was very slow in some parts and it was very lengthy too. Moreover, though it's all fictitious but still the ""Time Machine"" concept looked pretty ordinary. The Iron-Man tragedy was also pretty dramatic and illogical. Otherwise the movie does well. So overall.......... not upto the mark. Expected a lot!!!"
5795,"For a fan who waited 11 years for this movie,Its a treat.Some are questioning about the ending but for a hardcore fan it was the most satisfying ending.Well done Russos, Brilliant writing, Masterpiece acting and justice to every character of the MCU.Some will be missed and MCU is changed now. Most epic end to The Infinity Saga. Love you 3000."
5796,"Not overly great, but that's when comparing it to Infinity War. The humour was good, if a little unnecessary at times. I'm afraid I found myself looking at my watch just a little too much. That said, a solid 7."
5797,"I went to this movie expecting a lot, given both the hype/build up it had received and the absolutely amazing predecessor in Infinity War last year.[換行字元][換行字元]What I got however, was more questions than answers. The plot was weak at best and the storytelling was absolutely awful. The pace of storytelling was almost uncomfortable to watch at points. Infinity War very cleverly managed to give some real key characters decent screen time and dialogue, Endgame failed at this, massively. And the evolution of some characters in this film (Thor and Hulk) was laughable. Add o this, the film definitely did NOT need to be 3 hours long. It could quite easily have fitted into a 2-2.5 hour slot quite easily, they definitely hung out the wrong areas of the story for too long and for me personally, focusing on the wrong elements of the story.[換行字元][換行字元]I really am disappointed that the culmination of 22 films led to such a disappointing end, especially with the promising lead up Infinity War offered."

We are wasting our time"".[換行字元][換行字元]I couldn't agree more. We forced ourselves to continue watching though, maybe it would get better. It didn't. At times we both laughed at how bad it was.[換行字元][換行字元]The 10 year old who (again) LOVES super hero movies suddenly stopped watching while there was still 40 minutes left, he just went out to play instead. At this point I couldn't care less of how things turned out at the end so I just turned it off prematurely.[換行字元][換行字元]Just an indication of how failed this movie was, in our opinion."
5799,"My interest in Marvel was because of the character of Natasha and Steve Rogers.In my opinion, without Captain America, Marvel will lose viewers."
5800,These guys putting up fake reviews! End game is a waste of time and money! Weak story line! Hardly any action for thanos! Many things in the movie unexplained how they happened! Thor made a laughing stock! Why why! Big let down!
5801,"It has to be the end, being a marvel fan we all know what a beautiful memory it will be. Iron Man will be in our hearts forever."
5802,Endgame is one of those movies that uses the hype and nostalgia of the old ones to give off an illusion that it's good when in reality its unoriginal CGI filled poorly written garbage
5803,"After seeing ENDGAME for the second time, I'm ready to write my review, which will be difficult to do without spoilers. I find it interesting that those who gave INFINITY WAR a 10 were disappointed in this movie and I think I know why (for I am one of them) - INFINITY WAR took so many characters, such different tones in the worlds of the different heroes, with such a big story arc, yet managed to tell real stories interweaving the larger story, not just 3 minute cameos. ENDGAME, although having real moments of pathos, missed that balance. Despite moments of humour (many at cost of Thor's character, which I didn't appreciate), this movie basically had one tone and I was disappointed how some of our heroes were marginalized (and given bad haircuts). I know it was the end of an era, a passing of the torch. As a friend put it, ""Character development was never the focus of this movie, that was what all the previous movies were for...it was a perfect wrap up and set up for the next arc."" I agree this was all about the ensemble but there were edits (or complete changes) to our heroes' journeys for which I didn't care (too many stories were left off screen) with one exception (Nebula has a character arc). So, that's why I didn't enjoy this as much as INFINITY WAR yet it was still a great movie with great performances by all the cast, poignant moments of loss, great montages in the battle scenes and a real challenge demanding great cost. Kudos to the Russos and Kevin Feige for their hands at the tiller for this era. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superheroes Action Adventure}"
5804,"While no rabid Marvel comic book fan, I can say I have enjoyed the Avengers and their journey. From individual films that fleshed out back story to them coming together and being the force needed has been one long memory I will cherish.[換行字元][換行字元]Endgame was a true example of how to go out on top of your game. From the humor, the rich characters, the chemistry, the past (heartaches and joy), to the final minutes was a perfect mix and wild ride. It was a bittersweet ending. It did not need ""that particular scene"" to swell the emotions. The whole film was masterfully crafted with extra bits of care within the group.[換行字元][換行字元]There were some flubs, sure.They did not detract from the story nor did they stand out. For me, it added to the ""human"" feels. As I said, this should become the gold standard for going out on top rather than a whimper across the finish line. Did not feel like 3 hours, it went by far too fast.[換行字元][換行字元]If you don't see any other film this year, get to the theater for this one. It will engulf you and spirit you away from everyday."
5805,"End Game was the perfect conclusion to over a decade of storytelling. The MCU has set the bar far out of any other franchise's reach. No one will ever be able to replicate what they have done. When I saw this movie on opening night the theater was sold out for every showing. The theater had screening every 30 minutes plus separate 30 minute intervals for D box in 3D and IMAX. The entire theater was basically dedicated to showing end game. At the very first showing on Thursday there were absolutely no empty seats when I saw the movie. What amazes me about that is that one movie brought together hundreds of people from different backgrounds under one shared fandom. While watching End Game we laughed together, we cheered together, and we cried together. It's something amazing to see so many people satisfied by the same thing. The arcs of the original avengers we have come to know and love did not dissapoint me or leave me feeling empty. I didnt find myself questioning the direction at any point. The plot was captivating from beginning to end. The after math of the snap in infinity war was gut wrenching and emotional. I truely felt connected to the devastationthanos caused. End game completed the Avengers storyline with one of the most amazing battle sequences of all time. Although the avengers story was completed, End Game assured me the MCU still has a bright future. There are so many stories yet to be told. This movie's title carries the implication that it is the end of Marvel, but after watching it I feel the opposite. This is only the beginning. I look forward to more MCU characters and stories in the future. Above anything else, thing this movie made me certain that this is the age of the superhero."
5806,Despite its flaws this movie is an amazing ending for the heroes we come to love throughout the last decade. Years of build up leads to an emotional rollercoaster with fan-service done right.
5807,"I watched this and it gave me what I wanted without overblowing the movie with too many subplots. Other than the time travel aspect of the movie, even though any movie with time travel can be scrutinized it is a great film."
5808,The best end to the best saga. All 3 hours are impeccable
5809,"What an action, good final film, full of intrigue and very good at the action and story."
5810,"This movie was great for what it was. A closing of the book that is the MCU's first 10 years. It isn't going to satisfy everyone. It had funny moments, it had touching moments, it had moments of dread and desperation. Character development and closing of their arcs is far more important than visual appeal and action. Especially when you have to allow beloved characters to pass on the torch to the future of the MCU. People need to wait until explanations about certain decisions in the movie come to light. When people have watched the movie again and watched the director commentary along with it, then you can give a meaningful review."
5811,This movie is my favorite movie ever. You need to see this movie. There was nothing wrong with it.
5812,This movie was an excellent film that fulfills expectations and maintains a serious tone but doesn't fail to make you laugh. In the audience there are audible cheers as each character is revealed and tears among all audience members as the sad inevitably happens. The bad reviews often overlook the culture and environment this film gives easy 20/10
5813,By far the best movie I've ever seen. All the MCU films have been leading up to this and it does not disappoint! Go to watch this film before someone tells you what happens!
5814,"This film isnt just another regular si-fic film, believe me its beyond it. Its unexpectable, emotional and so exciting! Dont think you are going to watch infinity war 2 because its not! This is the best ending mcu could ever have for phase 3. Enjoy every moment of it."
5815,A saga of 22 films comes to its conclusion in a spectacular and bittersweet finale.
5816,"I am not afraid to say, that it is one of the greatest superhero movies of all time. It is full of emotions. It is not that kind of story, where the hero beats up the villain, saves the world, and happy ending. It shows, what a superhero's life looks like. That it's not just love and happy endings. It has a great moral message, which touches you in the heart, wether you are a superhero fan, or not. Plus no one could've made a better culmination to 21 films. Congrats Russo Brothers. 10/10"
5817,Its one of the best film's in the history of marvel
5818,"I am an upper middle aged woman who has no business watching superhero movies. My son dragged me into these and I am so glad he did. It was funny, sad, action packed and moving in so many ways. I will watch it again. And then, maybe again."
5819,"Watched the trailer and I went there to see lots of actions, jokes and CGI but It was something totally UNPREDICTABLE, it was a beautiful story well made for ages to come with touching key moments. It was very accurate to the comics, this was the real avengers made by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee. The actors performance and dialog was top notch, especially Robert Downey Jr and Scarlett Johansson. Thank you for this beautiful movie."
5820,This movie is absolutely amazing. I enjoyed almost every part of the amazing journey. Much better then infinity war and it truest lives up to the incredible hype it created over time. 10/10 would recommend.
5821,"End Game, here it is, finally after all the hype, the Zenith has been reached. Yet, once the credits started to roll, I was shocked to realise that I felt hollow. It ties together all the previous films, but it lacks energy. Whereas Infinity War had you on your toes from start to finish, here interest starts with a bang, then whimpers along until finally the end of the 2nd act. I get that it's supposed to be an emotional film, but for the first two hours, it's relentless. You'd be forgiven to believe you were watching a Hallmark feature. Constant sombre music with constant sombre facials.[換行字元][換行字元]The film does massive disservice to Thanos, whereas in the first film he is a constant danger to our heroes, here he is left behind the screening door. I understand why, it's because he had his limelight in Infinity War and that there was just too much story in End Game to give him screen time. Therein lies the problem, if the story that took his screen time away were great stories, all is forgiven, problem is, with the exception of one sub-plot, they are not. Don't even get me started with what happened to Thor.[換行字元][換行字元]They should have spent more time in the writing room, because honestly you can remove a substantial amount of the first two hours and it will have no impact on the third act. Unlike Infinity War where you can re-watch it a bunch of times, the first two hours of End Game will be fast forwarded and only the last hour will be repeated. They spent upwards of $400m on this and honestly, I can't tell where that went. Infinity War, no debate, you can see where that money went, End Game? Not so much.[換行字元][換行字元]I have a near graphic memory for films, I can repeat any memorable movie I have seen from start to finish, including dialogue. Films I am truly invested in, I can go as far as describing scenes in excruciating detail, where the coffee mug was left, how much coffee was left, if it was a warm or cold cup, the type and colour of the mug etc. It's a wasted talent, but when I struggle to recall what happened for those first two hours, something is not right. Don't get me wrong, it is a great film and it brings to the end over 45 hours of storytelling, but honestly, I expected a much bigger bang than this."
5822,This movie picks up after the devestating events of infinity War that wiped out half of all living creatures. In this movie you can really feel a sense of urgency from the avengers. And the way the characters are taken is all very pleasing. The acting is some of the best in an avengers film. The 3 hour run time is not a problem what's ever and I could've happily sat watching it for 5 or even 6 hours without feeling it dragging on.
5823,It's good I really do think that it's good but people over huped it
5824,Probably one of the worst Avengers movie to date. The plot was extremely childish and did not make sense. Completely went astray from the plot described in the comics. Very disappointed...
5825,Actually liked infinity war better but I find this movie awsome .
5826,"Let me start I'm a big fan of marvel so there is no biased against them. This movie is a big pile of trash. Don't give them your hard earn cash like I did, wish I could take back 3 hours of my life. Director thinks we watch superheroes movies looking for oscar winning performances. 2hours of nonsense time travel talk, about 15min action and than more nonsense pushing agenda #metoomovement?. I thought about walking out several times.[換行字元][換行字元]Rubbish."
5827,"Endgame 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Don't watch it with preconceived notions of what it's going to be. Forgive it's minor faults, it's a bloody great super hero movie."
5828,"This movie consists of amazing fan service, beautiful visuals, clever plot and intense moments. Many fans have absolutely loved the movie and rightfully so, but some fans have been dissapointed due to ""convoluted plot"" and ""plotholes"". As someone who was watching the movie with hawkeyes and without blinking, I can tell you that there are no actual plotholes or convolutions. Some fans have missed apparent plot devices and moments which bring the movie fullcircle. I have yet to see a single warranted critisism of this movie but if I had to come up with something less than ideal, I would say that if you are a Hulk fan you might not like this movie as much. The Hulk was undercut hard and wasnt very interesting or funny except for one scene. Thor was played in a similar manner and yet he works as a character and comic relief. As for Captain America & Iron Man, according to their contracts this is is supposed to be their last movies. This is definatly an amazing last chapter in their apparently last stories and an amazing end to an era of movies."
5829,"Closing out phase 3 in the best way they can. Every turn kept me at the edge of my seat. From hating it to loving it..... the best closing. Every character had their moments and they truly showed the best parts of them and character development. Everyone struggled with what happed at the end of infinity war now it's time to fight one last time... go watch it. Bring tissues. Bring extra snack, but most of all laugh and cry with everyone this is our last ride!"
5830,This is a good movie but its not a typical marvel movie. i mean aren't you a fan of marvel because of all those crazy action sequences? but this movie have it less. this is more like a ending to the previous movies so dont except it to be as equal as infinity war interms of action but this movie have a lot of emotional scenes which you can get attached if you are marvel fan but if you are not then the first 2hours wont make much sense to you. as a marvel fan i can rate this movie 10/10 i even watched it two times but as a general audience this movie goes to either 7 or 8.
5831,Funny-lovely-action-epic and at the same full of meaning.everyone is doing perfect
5832,"Soulless junk. The first act promised a serious take on the nature of revenge but the movie quickly gave up on interesting thematic and became a senseless mess.[換行字元][換行字元]I didn't care for a single character, the action was a confusing mess and the new characters do not give me much hope in the future of these Marvel films. On the plus side, this may mean diminishing returns on future instalments in this ""cinematic universe"" which would be great news for original films that aren't getting screened theatrically from the many megaplex screens being eaten up by this cynical capitalist trash. But hey... maybe the kids like it?"
5833,"I've never been a super fan of Superhero movies. Having said that have seen most of the marvel films. The one takeaway from Avengers Endgame is that it is an extremely ambitious piece of film making. It's unusual that so many of the actors and artists who many people have come to idolize over the years should come together in a film.[換行字元][換行字元]The film starts five years after Infinity Wars ended. Not going to include any spoilers, but there's a good part of the opening half of the film spent looking into the devastating consequences of Infinity Wars which are very script/character driven. Not surprisingly the second half of the film is very much action based and the 3 hours running time fairly fizzes along. Although it isn't perfect Endgame is definitely one of the best Superhero movies I've watched and lived up to expectations."
5834,"This was the first time that I watched the film of this series and I was feeling bad about what I have missed by not watching any of the movie of this series. The VFX, CGI work is amazing because of which it looks amazing on screen especially in 3D"
5835,"What the?......[換行字元][換行字元]how could i have enjoyed Infinity war so much and find this to be a bunch of total incoherent crap? leave the Time Traveling to the experts like Dr Who. I wont even go into the all the plot holes and no sense paradoxes as i'm sure many have already done but what a sad ending to a wonderful journey? and please Disney, please lay off on the Wokey preaching crap its getting tedious, lets just have a good story eh and leave the politics to the Politicians?"
5836,"THE LOW-DOWN: Statistically, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has achieved a great deal: over 11 years and 21 films, it has introduced dozens of relatively obscure characters into mainstream pop culture. More importantly, however, the franchise has proven that long-form storytelling can work in a cinematic context - as long as you balance plot with heart and humour, prizing character development over spectacle. That's no small feat, and it's even more remarkable that a movie with the gargantuan scale and ambition of Avengers: Endgame doesn't fall apart beneath the weight of an unwieldy script or great expectations. In fact, this is the MCU's crowning achievement: a heartfelt love letter to the Avengers, their stories, the actors who play them, and to the fans.[換行字元][換行字元]THE STORY: That damn Snap, eh? At the end of Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos wiped out half of the galaxy's population with a snap of his Infinity-Stone-enhanced fingers. After bearing witness to teammates and loved ones vanishing in swirls of dust and ash, the remaining Avengers struggle to live with the crippling grief and guilt of surviving the Snap... and of failing to prevent it. Some characters spiral into darkness; others are frozen in place - a few even manage to move on. But hope is rekindled when Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) returns from the mysterious Quantum Realm, where the usual laws of physics, space and time do not apply...[換行字元][換行字元]THE GREAT: Endgame is a storytelling triumph - not only does it bring together and pay off plots and ideas that were seeded over a decade ago, it builds solid, powerful, heartrendingly emotional narrative arcs for almost all of the original Avengers. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) must grapple with their pasts to figure out their futures, while Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) find themselves literally fighting to save their families. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) might provide much of the film's comic relief, but both characters are also gifted with grace notes, growth and moments of true peace.[換行字元][換行字元]THE SUPER-GREAT: The ability to juggle and create space for multiple perspectives and storylines in one film has been honed to a fine art by directors Anthony and Joe Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. But their narrative strategy feels virtuosic in Endgame, paired as it is with an ingenious plot device that allows the film to truly acknowledge the staggering depth and breadth of its own history. Suddenly, the emotional and narrative stakes are raised, as beloved characters are forced to re-examine their lives, stories and priorities. You might find yourself in tears and in stitches, frequently in the same scene, and this happens throughout the film - a testament to the Russo Brothers' genius and their skills at anchoring even the most outlandish of storylines in humour and humanity.[換行字元][換行字元]THE NOT-SO-GREAT: This is emphatically not a film for casual viewers - there is no entry point, no easing in, no exposition, to help you understand what the heck is going on if you haven't watched most of the preceding films in the MCU. There are also a few logical fallacies and plotholes scattered throughout Endgame that will puzzle you the more you think about them - from the wobbly rules governing time travel to the fractured way in which the too-conveniently hyper-powered Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) pops in and out of the story.[換行字元][換行字元]STAN SERVICE: This film, above all others in the MCU, feels like a heartfelt tribute to the very concept of Marvel itself, finding numerous ways to reward and delight true-blue fans. Naturally, it includes Stan Lee's final appearance in the MCU, while folding in a host of other cameos and callbacks that reinforce the interconnectedness of the entire franchise - of all the stories that have been told before, especially the movie that started it all (Iron Man in 2008). There are even a couple of brilliant nods to comics lore, largely centred around the character of Captain America, that feel like the Russo Brothers are deliberately righting a few wrongs where some of Marvel Comics' more controversial plot twists are concerned. (See: Nick Spencer's run on Captain America: Steve Rogers.)[換行字元][換行字元]CAST-IRON MVP: Casting outside of the box has always been one of the MCU's core strengths, with Oscar winners/nominees and character actors regularly popping up to play heroes and villains alike. That canny casting strategy pays off in spades in Endgame - especially when certain characters have relatively limited screen time but manage to make it count anyway. The undisputed stars of the movie, however, are the Avengers who started it all. Hemsworth continues to brilliantly dance along the knife-edge between comedy and pathos, while Ruffalo radiates charm and intelligence through ever-improving CGI as Banner and his not-so-mean, green alter ego: The Hulk. Johansson and Renner are given more to do in this film than ever before, and their combined efforts will shred your soul to pieces. Evans brings great warmth and strength to his stoic role, making it perfectly legitimate for you to weep and whoop for a man who's - somewhat ridiculously - wrapped in an American flag. Above all, this double-whammy of Avengers films belongs, most fittingly, to Downey Jr. He still effortlessly injects Tony with snark and swagger, but also beautifully conveys every shade and layer of his character's hard-won growth and maturity - giving us all the proof that we have never needed that Tony Stark has a heart.[換行字元][換行字元]RECOMMENDED? In every imaginable way. Endgame sets the bar as high as it can possibly go for superhero epics that balance enormous scale and jaw-dropping ambition with actual substance and genuine emotion. It's the blockbuster movie event of our lifetimes, for very good reason - and it's worth every minute you've invested in the MCU since 2008."
5837,Warning to parents. This movie was mind blowing and completely amazing except for the fact that they felt like they had to force GD into it twice so families can't enjoy it with their children who are Marvel fans.
5838,"All I can say is that I've never been into the comics but this sets such a high bar maybe I missed out? I'm one who would rather watch the movie it's safe to say. Seriously this is the ultimate escapist celluloid brilliance I've witnessed in over 50-years of movies. This film is the masterpiece of the genre. What a cast too. I think after some settling I will actually feel inspired to go through the entire franchise again knowing this carrot is at the end. No criticism of any kind can I think of. Truly excellent to the point even if you're never seen anything Marvel you should step up and see Avenger's"" Endgame."
5839,Cast of too many and the depiction of Thor was outrageously pathetic as a super hero's character.
5840,No post credit scene don't wait for that. Must watch. You'll be at end of your seats in second half.don't waste your time reading this go and watch it ASAP
5841,"My friend,isn't watch any other marvel before,she still cry.Then you can know the movie not just is normal hero movie. The movie has lot of twist that in sometime you can't direct.The character's emotion protrey is good.Beside the actor is pect and the story is good too.It don't have any strange event or reason to do that.After you watching it,you will still have lot of feeling you can let them go.Go to see the movie to have amazing experience!"
5842,"The movie isn't about fight but it's about the struggle they have made for each other and the familys who have been vanished. And they actually did ""whatever it takes"""
5843,"Anyone who complains about this film has not appreciated the last 10+ years of Marvel cinematic creation. Apparently everyone is a ""genius"" and those that have been working on these movies for this long are idiots. This was the best and most perfect way to end the Infinity War Saga. They blew everything out of the water and delivered exactly what fans needed and wished for. Those that apparently have been writing movies from their couches fo their entire lives while sipping on mama's kool aid need to check themselves. What blows my mind more than the movie is the fact that there are actually people griping about it and finding every reason to whine and moan about something that you never could dictate - so why bother wasting so much time? It was good. It may end up being the highest grossing film of all time. That says enough."
5844,A movie worth watching. If you have a busy schedule them too give 3 hours for this movie.
5845,Its the end of a era. A big goodbye. A rear Will fall and u Will leave the movie behind and stay heartbroken
5846,"That movie was so emotional, yet full of action. Funny, yet deep with meaning. The plot line was so well thought out, that it gave you the impression it&apos;s impossible for a human brain to actually pull this off. Every little detail clicked, every scene had its meaning. I&apos;ve never laughed and cried and were at the edge of my seat all at the same time, in a single movie. I thought it was gonna be just a re-do, a battle and then bye-bye Avengers era. But, no. It was so much more. It was an epic way to mark a 10 year old journey. Russo brothers, you blew me away. You better get an oscar for that screen writing. Oh, and RDJ you are a brilliant actor. You deserve all the millions they gave you. EVERY. SINGLE. PENNY."
5847,"Something we've obviously not seen before, and not sure, even with Marvel, we'll ever quite see again.[換行字元][換行字元]It includes everything: development of already great Characters, spectacular action and incredible effects, humour, happiness, sadness - honestly, what more can you ask.[換行字元][換行字元]Really don't know how they can possibly top this - up there with the very best of Action films, like Raiders....."
5848,Just watch it as many times you can laugh cry shout Surrender to the perfection called marvel
5849,If I could erase this film from my memory that would be great. I am going to go with avengers ending after infinity war. I'm not sure why people are worried about spoilers as the same thing happens in every movie. If you haven't seen the film yet think of the stupidest thing you could imagine then try and complicate it by banging on for 3 hours and it will be pretty close to this absolute trash of a film.
5850,"Although I've had my issues with many of the Marvel films, I have to say this film feels like a fitting conclusion to the massive empire Marvel has amassed. This truly felt like a superhero film to me as it was gargantuan and the film is packed with epic moments. All the triumphs the Avengers have in the film really propel them to a legendary status only works because of the years of world building Marvel has done. There's plenty of moments which inspire awe amongst Marvel fans and it thrives under a complex narrative, highlighting the true nature of heroism. The chemistry between characters feels truly authentic and the dynamic between Captain America and Iron Man in this film elevates them to generational icons, giving them the well developed characterization they deserve. The well crafted and driven plot feels much more focused than Inifinity War which was devoid of charm amongst its other issues. There was no Thanos centric plot which feels forced and each hero in the film is able to shine though their chatcter arcs. Sure we don't have all of our beloved heroes that died in infinity war, but it gives the heroes who survived the room to stand out from the crowd. This film is truly a massive blockbuster and I doubt such a massive film will be made anytime soon. This film will be a landmark in cinema and how previous generations had Star Wars and other massive blockbusters, we will have Avengers: Endgame. This film truly feels like a proper ending to an massive anthology acting as an ode to Marvel fans and cinema goers alike. This is a moment in cinematic history, like it or not, so do yourself a favor and go watch this epic blockbuster."
5851,"Long, boring, phoned in with lazy writing. The hard fact is that Avengers Endgame is less entertaining than watching a dog pinch a loaf on your front lawn. It is an awful movie."
5852,"The movie was good...but i was expecting action like infinity war. Also, they completely destroyed thanos' character.. Thanos in Infinity war was way better. His dialogues were also better in Infinity war. There are many plot holes in this movie. And the movie was pretty much predictable. I don't know about others, but, they failed me."
5853,I mean come on. Is this actually the best movie you've seen? How is this messy movie better than Guardians 1 or Winter Soldier? This movie shouldn't definitely even be in the top 50 on IMBD.
5854,"This Movie is amazing. Get ready for a perfect way to finish it. This Movie is packed with moments that will be remembered and will get you wanting to reach for the Tissues. This Movie will, for sure, break Records like no other. They did this Movie great.

5856,"This was an emotional roller coaster, extremely good. It had just the right amount of comedy, sadness, excitement, and everything in between to make you remember this movie forever. I would definitely recommend you to watch, although I have to say, what the hell were you all doing with your lives if you still didn't watch it yet."
5857,"This was not the Grand Final i expected. It is just a Fan pleaser movie for the last Decade of MCU Films. I wanted to give it a seven, however I do understand why it was done this way, so it gets an eight. It was too much on feelings, to much slapstick ..anyway Homecoming is near to end phase 3 technically and I think it will be the better film overall."
5858,Endgame is not your average superhero movie. All the heroes in the end are human. They suffer as well. This movie takes a step back and looks at it from the human point of view. This movie is beautifully crafted and very well paced.[換行字元][換行字元]To everyone reading the reviews of critics. Don't. Endgame will touch your heart. It's not always fighting thats gonna help you win.

5859,"Flawless. This movie is a love...no... An exquisite, poetic love letter to 11 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If Iron Man started this journey, Endgame bookended it flawlessly. While many are going to say there is too much fan service in it. The referencing in the movie doesn't feel overdone when we are talking 11 years of backstory to reference. Unlike say The Force Awakens where you get borderline jarring references to the prior 3 movies. Some may also say the first act of the movie is slow and boring, maybe even a slow burn. I call it kindling to kick off the fire that is the 2nd half of the movie. That first act sets up the results of Infinity War. It had to be done as it showed what happened to not only our heroes but the world. Its sets the stakes and prepares us for a heck of a ride in the last 2 hours of the movie.[換行字元][換行字元]The ending of the movie. GAH. I can't say anything without giving something away. But it completed this saga in a perfect character arc.[換行字元][換行字元]You look at the surface of this movie all you will see is a summer blockbuster action movie like everything else. You think about it in how it integrates with the other....what? 21 other movies? And you will see this movie completes a saga unlike any other movie that has come before.[換行字元][換行字元]No movie has ever completed a 21 movie / 11 year story. This is the first, and this will be the gold standard going forward. People will be analyzing what Disney and Marvel have done between 2008 - 2019 for decades to come in classes. Both from a business sense and an artistic sense.[換行字元][換行字元]I'll be blunt. I've NEVER blathered on about a film before like this. I'm not a Marvel fanboi. I like the movies. They are all good. Some better than others. Some are meh. Some elevate themselves above the rest. But Endgame? The Russo brothers have a fan for life in me. I will see any movie they put out going forward."
5860,"I've never seen any epic movie in my entire life this is legit! 💕✨ Thanks Marvel , thanks stan lee for giving us this awesome moments"
5861,"Any Marvel fan would enjoy the movie no problem but having a sister who doesn't enjoy most movies and getting her to cry to a movie she doesn't know much about now that, that is an accomplishment my friend.The movie is literally for everyone all you have to do is have a little context and you'll fall in love with all the characters and you'll end up being back to their beginning listening to their story and becoming a true fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
5862,"The movie is not very good, special effects at the limit of viewable, iron girl and hulk that are really horrible at times[換行字元][換行字元]An actor's mess misorder throughout the film, script facilities or the fact that the film does not even respect the rules he may have laid on his world, the script is extremely predictable, the jokes are not very funny, thor will still remain a nice surprise, but unfortunately no one in the room could take him seriously afterwards for more serious scenes, people began to laugh during sad scenes or wanted serious scenes.[換行字元][換行字元]Captain marvel is unbearable and is only there to serve as a deus ex machina, or a ridiculous feminist scenes that cut in the middle of an action scene, really misplaced, even seems like the scene was shot after the fact.[換行字元][換行字元]Characters who literally have 5min of screentime.[換行字元][換行字元]And the end fight, the end fight is so much of a disappointment, can you imagine an incredible scene that will decide the fate of the earth?[換行字元][換行字元]No just a scene trying to put as much marvel characters possible on screen and 90% of the time you'll just see them running.[換行字元][換行字元]The movie clearly doesn't deserve 9 out of 10 and 3 hours to tell its story? Infinity war had surprised me despite some mistakes that can be found on this one, but endgame is even less well written and ordered than infinity war.[換行字元][換行字元]Anyway, if this movie should end this rather average movie series, well, it will end up on a bad note."
5863,"So, i loved ""infinity war""and I was hoping for something better, that would blow my mind. After 2 hours i was checking my watch, that bever happened to me at an ""Avengers"" movie. I went out of the cinema demandibg my 3 hours back. This movie is a 6 at best, i gave it 1 just to balnce the stupid high 8,9 rate."
5864,"Marvel did an amazing job, nothing could be better in the next phase."
5865,Best movie ever i cant bshdjdsnshsususjdjdjsjsjsjdjdjdjdhdididudbdbhsiwiwiwje eevhsuxjxbddj
5866,"Quite good, great effects (as expected). It was interesting to see Avengers beaten, broken, a nice phoenix arc. Only downsides are Captain Marvel (damn, that actress is wooden) and one cringy feminist scene, thankfully a very short one. Since many of the best are out/dead (or promised to NOT have a series/movie like Scarlet Witch), I don't think following products will be worth watching. If you are really invested, I would recommend waiting for proper reviews for a few weeks (just ignore ""professional"" critics), or buy it at significant discount later."
5867,Before this my all time favourite movie was Gladiator. But this one topped that . I have seen all Marvel movies more than one time. And the conclusion to all those movies is perfect. Ppl who don't like the story or the pace of the movie do not get what they tried to achieve over 22 movies. I can't see anything wrong with the movie. Things that bothered some ppl didn't bother me at all. This was the end of an era do ppl rlly want that fitted in a 2 hour movie NOoooo! Dont be a baby over the 3 hour sit. It is so worth it! If u can't see that than don't bother writing a review. I can accept bad reviews if they are thought trough. Everybody has their own taste but don't hate just to hate. I wrote this cause ppl that like movies don't leave reviews as often as ppl who don't like it. So go watch this movie and enjoy every second of it ;-)
5868,"This movie, the culmination of story telling spanning over 10 years. Is one of the best superhero movies I have seen, genuinely breathtaking, each shot more purposeful than the last. I genuinely don't understand the complaints about the first half of the film. As not only is the first half essential to the development of the ideas and themes in this film, we also need to see how the Avengers deal with the loss they faced in the previous movie. Not only does this movie deliver on the time invested by fans in spades, newcomers can also enjoy the premise it provides to viewers.[換行字元][換行字元]Do yourself a favour and watch this movie."
5869,"They jumped right into it then had a story to tell. So many Easter eggs and scenes that fans from the comics and the MCU are very pleased with. I cried like a baby at the end, and my jaw dropped viewing the best superhero fight scene of all time ever put to film. I am so hype I have to go to the theater again to see Endgame. I cant wait till it is on video so I can watch it another hundred times. Excellent film Russo Brothers, that's how you make a movie!"
5870,Avengers end game is a unique cinema experience like no other simply amazing a must see not just for comic book fans but for everyone.
5871,"Great movie but batle should be longer. This was a lost opportunity to show all heroes using their powers, more time for Captain Marvel fighting, Hulk less intelectual and more beast, and imagine if Wolverine appears from one of the circles!"
5872,"This is an edit on my first review where I talked about how I loved it more on my second viewing than my first, which guys you have to see it twice, but I now think about how my Dad took me to see the star wars movies and the Indiana Jones movies and how that was my childhood. I took my kids and I HOPE that when they grow up the avengers theme is thier star war theme for me![換行字元][換行字元]My Dad has passed away and my regret is I couldn't show him what he showed me.[換行字元][換行字元]Take your Dad man, you'll be forever grateful.[換行字元][換行字元]My first review was an 8 out of 10, this is by far my (childhood) Empire."
5873,It was a very cool movie with a lot of emotion and action
5874,Wost movie ever seen total waste of time no action no nothing just bad bad bad bad
5875,"Wow. This film will have you going through every emotion imaginable. If you have followed every Marvel movie in sequence leading up to this conclusion, you will soon be left feeling like you have lost a family member. An amazing end to this Marvel chapter."
5876,"It's time for the MCU to get the recognition it deserves. Endgame is a masterpiece, well written, acted and directed. No need for the Oscars in 2020, just give all the awards to the Avengers cast and crew."
5877,"I went to this movie opening night with some friends and loved it. Went again a week later with my brother and parents. My parents are not people who really love superhero movies, but both of them loved this movie. Seriously, everyone should go see this movie, at least once. There is a 99% chance you will like it"
5878,They should make namor X-Men fantastic four and let's not forget moon knight
5879,"The best MARVEL movie, till the next one! Can't wait to see the future of MCU"
5880,"Infinity war was your quintessential action flick. Endgame felt different right from the opening scene with Hawkeye and his family. I'm not a Marvel fanboy so I remember feeling apathetic while watching Infinity War. It was a really good movie just didn't overwhelming pull me into the story. I have since watching infinity war again prior to Endgame and enjoyed it a bit more the second go around. That said, Endgame has less action but more emotional depth. It's more character driven movie (probably since less characters are given screen time for obvious reasons). I probably won't want to watching endgame multiple times. The one time of watching it though was surprisingly engaging as I was starting to feel Marvel movies in general were wearing on me and becoming an exercise in itself."
5881,"If you haven't seen this movie, you need to get a box of tissues, and go watch it cuz it's soo good!!!"
5882,It could have been better made movie as a special ending to 12 years of MCU series. Poorly scripted storyline with wasted screen time on unwanted characters.
5883,We grow up watching MCU Superhero movies.. I think that End game is the prize for us.. 21 movies with an epic conclusion
5884,"The movie is a masterpiece, even that the first and second act are very slow, the movie catches you and makes you wait for the third act to arrive, and my man when it arrives... you hit the palm of such incredible that it is. And it ends with mastery, giving an epic end to a great circle that began in 2008. I recommend this movie to all who are fans of superheroes. Congratulations MARVEL, you got it."
5885,"This movie plays with your emotions if you have been keeping track with the MCU. If you haven't, don't watch this movie. This movie isn't for you. But if you have, this movie will blow your mind. It's epic, it's big and a feast to your eyes. It's not one of your typical comicbook movies. It has real stakes and the visuals are stunning. It has flaws of course, like some characters could've been handled better. But I think it's one of the best comicbook movies ever. The visuals, the storytelling, the stakes, the characters, it's just amazing."
5886,"It is not only a movie,but also my memory of the last ten years."
5887,"What a remarkable journey it is for Marvel Cinematic Universe. I don't think anything can accomplish this kind of achievement in another franchise universe. This is indeed one of a kind.[換行字元][換行字元]To everyone contributing in the making of this universe, producers, story writers, directors, actors, CGI makers, and everyone involved, from the bottom of my heart, I say thank you very much for the experience, the sensation, the excitement, the wonders you guys brought to the movies.."
5888,"The movie is undoubtedly amazing in terms of visual-audio experience, plot, emotion, moments you will never forget for the rest of your life. The astonishing culmination of 21 episodes. I definitely recommend it to everyone."
5889,Characters go full circle so bring lots of tissues. Best movie ever!
5890,"MARVELOUS Nothing short of spectacular. An ensemble of epic proportions. A group of remarkable individuals: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Paul Rudd, Jeremy Renner, Brie Larson, Josh Brolin, Karen Gillian, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Russo Brothers, Kevin Feige and many many more have created the event of a generation that'll be forever celebrated in the halls of great cinema magic."
5891,"Loved most of the first 22(?) films in the series. Endgame truly sucked. Decent acting, absolutely crap plot. I wish I'd never seen any of the film's in the series now."
5892,You show us that a women! sacrificed her life to protect us from the very person.
5893,I can't believe how well they did this. My expectations were so high and yet there is nothing I would change about it. Im seriously speechless.
5894,Best marvel movie of all time. Its because we waited this moment since 2008 with pation. Some of the people give 1/10 this movie and they are probably kid and looking for just action nothing more.
5895,In just few words I want to give the review about film. As a diehard marvel fan you'll be really proud to be MCU fan. What an epic conclusion to the 22 films! This is the kind of film that after repeated watching you'll get that same deep satisfaction you get on the 1st time watching.
5896,"So much to see here, lots going on. First movie in years where I did not allow myself a 5 minute potty break. amazing and original and impactful. the best!"
5897,"Had a lot going on. Expected a lot more emotions to be evoked. Left me asking for more in a negative way. Moved too fast. Other than the fight scene, which envoked the feel cause of its grandeur, nothing actually makes a lasting impact on you"
5898,The is the best of the movie😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
5899,"I'm 24 yrs old, and I've always heard about how people felt when they watched the empire strikes back in theaters for the first time and claimed that it was the moment they kept telling their kids about all those years later. Well, this movie made me feel that! It left a mark in my memory and my heart and I WILL tell my kids about it should the time ever come. I started watching Marvel movies as a teen and finished them with this movie as an adult. I will still watch whatever they bring next to the table, but Avengers: Endgame has definitely taken the spot as my favorite Superhero movie and one of my all time favorites for the rest of my life."
5900,A masterpiece. Excellent storytelling and writing. I could not have hoped for a better movie.
5901,"Avengers: Endgame is the fourth installment in the Avengers series. It's also MCU's 22nd movie and final installment of the Infinity Saga. This film is everything Marvel fan could ever dream for. Fan service is huge in this film but I think this film really benefited from that. Every character has their moment to shine and nothing feels forced. Seeing all of these characters on screen together for the one last time was very touching. Movie like this will stay with me forever. It was filled with sad, fun and just mind blowing moments. I believe many people will feel conflicted about the ending. So did I, but more I think about it the more I really love it."
5902,Really? Peggy had a family. And what about Bucky??
5903,This movie was absolutely perfect. There is nothing more I wanted in this film and it gave me all kinds of emotions that I've never felt in a movie Before! it had the most satisfying ending and it really did conclude the Avengers. The final battle is way more that I could've ever wanted and they also made Hawkeye so badass and I loved him in this film 😂
5904,"It's bold, brilliant, awesome and heartbreaking. This is the best way the Avengers films could have ended, and soo much more. I absolutely love it"
5905,"Everyone and their mother has likely talked about how this film is over a decade in the making so I won't bring that up to much except to say that this film, like Infinity War, relies on that history. And this is a good thing as it has a lot of new content that builds off that foundation. Avengers: Endgame is filled with some shocking twists, heart wrenching deaths, and amazing cinematic moments you will never forget. If you even slightly enjoy the Marvel films, you cannot pass up seeing this movie. If Infinity War was daring in using most of its run time for villain focus and battles, this one is unique in how different its three acts are from one another. It makes the film quite re-watchable despite its length. And it all leads up to a finale you have to see to believe. Characters like Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Captain America shine like never before, as the writing for characters is incredibly strong in this movie. I would not say this is the best Avengers film. Its pacing can seem sluggish the first time around and some characters are treated as jokes more than they ought. However, the final act utilizes even its weaknesses to deliver on a satisfying conclusion. The only question left in your mind will be ""Where will Marvel take us next?"""
5906,I love how they took care of all comic details to end the era of the Avengers. Totally worth it and enjoyed it to the last second.
5907,"This film was a beautiful ending to the saga of Avengers, although we do not know if there are more films awaiting us. It was such a meaningful film, with so many touching moments that make us think back to the old times of Avengers, one of the most iconic groups we will ever see in this generation. Avengers made me cry, which was not expected. Not one single superhero adventure saga movie has ever made me cry. But this one did. Infinity War left me breathless, and Endgame left me even more speechless. Iron Man's death was so well crafted, so deep and meaningful. This film portrays everything Marvel ever had. Everybody. One huge entire family. The film unfolding every step of the way. This film is truly an unforgettable one."
5908,"There's absolutely no pay off to be had plot wise here. Nothing to see here people. Fast forward through to the last hour and you're good. You will have missed nothing.[換行字元][換行字元]This movie was either way too long or just nowhere near long enough.

(No, we honestly mean it this time.)[換行字元][換行字元]Sadly, the first hour or so of the movie is Ant Man trying to save a tacked on, marketing driven first act that pays off in no way. Meanwhile, also tied to marketing, some major plot holes and omissions were completely egregious.[換行字元][換行字元]A large portion of the principle photography for this movie was done alongside side Infinity Wars itself, which would've made sense if they'd had a coherent story line by then.[換行字元][換行字元]Leave it to the screenwriters, they'll make something of it. Leave it to the editors, they'll fix it in post. Well, somebody forgot to fix it. And it wasn't me.

Look at Loki! Now that's an interesting character. He can be good; he can be bad. He's fiendish and lovable. He's a hero and a villain and an anti-hero and-still, somehow-human, god, and ice thing.[換行字元][換行字元]Honestly, Infinity Wars couldn't have come at a worse time. It was originally a much larger unification of Marvel heroes and villains, and now that Disney owns all of the other Marvel Universe crap, that movie could've been the Infinity Wars, with a plot that started to wrap up before the last movie.[換行字元][換行字元]Ah well, maybe in 20 years they'll redo the whole thing again with the X-Men and Silver Surfer in it (take or leave the Fan-4.

Because it sounds to me like Spider Man visits France for Holiday and Meets some Good Guys and some Bad Guys and forces you to watch the credits so you can see 30 seconds that tease you into watching the next movie that's just going to do the same thing."
5909,"Avengers: Endgame (2019) BROKE MY SCALE 20/10[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]""A finale so masterfully constructed, Avengers: Endgame proves to us that a finale WILL do whatever it takes to treat the fans with an emotionally moving, action-packed masterpiece.""[換行字元][換行字元][換行字元][換行字元]I am just blown away by how well Endgame does for itself. My expectations were stacked, and the film somehow managed to surpass those expectations. Like Infinity War, Endgame manages to strategically balance the humor with the seriousness of specific aspects, you'll either be laughing or crying, or both at certain points. The action still stands out as a fair product of entertainment, going to the extremity of any situation, no matter how impossible it may have seemed; taking risky moves to get the film's point across the table. Lastly, the characters are so well written in this, sometimes its just hard to believe that our original heroes conclude their stories in this tearjerking finale; it really is hard to say goodbye sometimes when we've grown on these characters since day one. I can even say that Thanos' character is basically given the upgrade in sociopathic motive, making him somewhat unpredictable just like the predecessor. The film does have its minimalistic flaws (like any other film) but I felt that these flaws are completely ineffective towards the the whole idea of what points the film intends to display.[換行字元][換行字元]Verdict: Avengers: Endgame marks the end of an era that lasted 11 years. It concludes a story so fashionably well, its safe to say to bring the tissue and bring the applause, because there's no way in hell anyone was prepared for this epic finale.[換行字元][換行字元]One more thing, I'd like to thank everyone who was involved in the making of Endgame (especially the Russo Brothers), and anyone who contributed to the build up to this conclusion we've all waited for. And a final thank you to the man himself, Stan Lee, for showing us that the real heroes are the fans because WE made it happen. May he rest in peace, thank you for reading folks."
5910,Wow. Just wow. Marvel did it again. They never fail to impress when the viewers think they can't possibly top the previous masterpiece.
5911,That dis movie is gonna be so epic It deserves more than that TBH
5912,The real movie was gr8. Best work ever done by marvels
5913,Mind blowing movie it was totally worth it for 3hrs..!
5914,The hype for this film was better than the actual film. Whilst it did pick up towards the end most of the time it was mediocre. There were plot holes that didn't make sense in the established MCU timeline. What they did with Thor's character could have been really good but it felt too forced. Another forced thing in this film was the all female fight scene and was a bit over the top. Although Valkyrie riding a Pegasus was amazing. I think the MCU would really benefit if they stopped putting so many jokes in their films and made them darker. Of course that'll never happen whilst they're under Disney.
5915,"This movie was great. It was full of tragic moments, plot twists, new concepts and more. The ending was great, and I walked out of the movie theater greatly satisfied. It wrapped up the MCU in a great way, and will make all future films more memorable.[換行字元][換行字元]It was just great!!!"
5916,"One of my favorite movie series. Felt sad, cried but still had fun. sad this series has reach its end but all series entertained me and my nieces and nephews had theie own hrroes through them. Love this movie and forever a fan! Love you Scarlet johansson"
5917,"We got everything we wanted and more. Great storytelling, great effects, simply a rollercoaster of feelings ... i knew i should brought tissues ... but I didn't."
5918,"Like Thanos said, ""Perfectly balanced. As all things should be"". Hats off to Russo Brothers and the entire cast and crew. Yet again, RBD Jr., pulled it off effortlessly. It's visually enthralling! Overall an awesome movie, could watch it on a loop."
5919,"Infinity war perfectly meshed the missing components in terms of adding the missing members of the avengers such as the guardians of the galaxy as well as the new MCU addition Spiderman as well as introducing us to Thanos wth a lot of backstory masterfully executed. It saddened and frustrated how it ended but in hindsight set the stage perfectly for endgame which got the creative juices really going with very high expectation set by its predecessor. Unfortunately it got wasted with the Russo brother pulling continuously at the string of the worlds smallest violin turning what should have been a magnificent superhero movie into a nonstop tear jerker. Though I can appreciate the underlying theme of this movie is about dealing with loss and being triumphant at the end.. It seems the former is continuously stuffed down peoples throat for at least two hours.As a poster ealier pointed out its 2 hours of crying, some action and crying again. The climax of the movie was enjoyable though it didn't cover screen time as much as it should have when it was the main reason people came to watch the movie. Theres a lot of things that happen to the movie which either don't make much sense, either happen to quick or just illustrate lazy writing assuming the viewer will fill in the gaps with a lot of cheesy content which gets you thinking 'really'. It almost seems as though they had put thought into how they wanted the story to end but didn't put much creative thought to the journey leading to the climax as simply cobbled whatever they may have left out of the MCU in the previous movies into this for fan service. As an MCU fan I would still advise people to view it as its end of this saga but don't believe a lot of the hype that's on this review board or you will be immensely disappointed."
5920,"Avengers Endgame is a perfect culmination of the 11 years of build up and 21 movies. In this movie they showcases us on how our main heroes dealt with the traumatizing event of Infinity War and how the cope and dealt this situation. I never ever cry in movies but my god, this one almost did. I won't give away anything, but the ending of 2 characters in this movie made me cry and put a smile on my face because of how right and perfect it is. This is by no means a perfect movie but it is a perfect ending. I gave it 10 Stars because of how I resonate with this film and how it ends the Marvel Cinematic Universe so perfectly."
5921,A must watch film. An emotional rollercoaster filled with humour and emotions. End of a great era. Masterpiece of Marvel and Russo brothers. Kudos to them
5922,Are those people who rated this higher than a four suffering from cognitive dissonance? It seems you all allowed the hype to inect your thinking and judgement. This is in my opinion the worse film in the Marvel universe series followed by civil war. To many characters a (story) so so lazy that wasonly written to try and tie the strands of the universe together. The film is at least 1 whole hour to long and is frankly boring. Disney are in danger of destroying this franchise like they have ruined the star wars saga. Why have they ruined the hulk who is now a cuddly bubbling idiot with everything that made him one of the most loved characters stripped from him. Even the set pieces are so so nothing different nothing original. People on here need to start telling the truth because a rating averaging 8.6 is simply a lie. Go watch it and review it without society's cognitive dissonance about this film running through your brains. 4/10 the worse in the series.
5923,Woooooooooooooow..... what did I just watched.... I was sad and happy in the same time. I really enjoyed watching it.... EPIC
5924,"Why did they decide to end it like this?? I mean I'd read fan theories that were far better than what they pulled off. Infinity war was way way way better from pretty much every point of view. Script, directing, story, .... Everything seemed so pointless and cartoony in End Game. There are so many laughable moments, no epicness at all. I mean this movie should be representing the end of an era for that matter. There is absolutely no scene strong enough to be remembered. All the previous Marvel phase 3 movies were better than this one. So disappointed."
5925,Its perfect I love it 👊 Avengers is my love movie
5926,It's the best movie all over the world.. the figure says it all..!!
5927,"Ohh it plays with your emotions, OOOO it really plays with you. I can't believe it's over... It couldn't have been better than this. Can't wait to watch it again."
5928,Thank you Russo brothers Thank you Alan Silvester Thank you all the casts Thank you Marvel[換行字元][換行字元]THANK YOU STAN LEE Don't forget to bring your tissue!
5929,"Whether it's from being incredibly epic or eerie, this movie will give you chills."
5930,"Honestly: at the 2 hour mark i was checking my watch to try and figure out how much more I had to put up with before it made sense. The storyline was sporadic, and bounced around so much that it just got confusing and boring. I have no intent, nor interest, to watch it again"
5931,"I love all character of this movie,i think mcu can did better than killing rdj."
5932,"As the most anticipated film of the year, Endgame certainly doesn't have it easy, but you won't be disappointed."
5933,"A truly cinematic event. An awesome conclusion to the Infinity Saga, just incredible! You just don't feel the 3 hours."
5934,"This movie was a great conclusion to the last 11 years of the MCU. You will laugh, you will cheer and you will even cry. This movie takes multiple unexpected turns. When this movie unfolds you surprisingly get to learn more about the characters that survived the Snap. MCU took a different style of storytelling which was very risky for a marvel movie, but they pulled it off. If you are thinking of watching this movie, I strongly recommend that you stay away from as many spoilers as possible. Trust me, the less you know about the movie the more you will love it. Go see it ASAP. I love it 3000."
5935,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. One of the best movies I have seen. Ever. I am going to see it again next weekend. I had it spoiled for me but watching it happen. That experience can never be spoiled. I laughed one minute and cried the next. It tugged at heart strings and tickled the funny bone whilst including the mandatory amount of action any Marvel movie needs. All round perfect.
5936,"This movie is the perfect closure for an era.. I grew up with this movies, and I hoped for a perfect ending.. And i got it.. Epic moments.. Fights that give me chills.. I cried like a little child.. I felt emotions that only this movie could give me.. EPIC is the only word I can say to describe this movie.."
5937,"Total closure for an Era. Seeing all my heroes so humane, so real brought me inner peace. When Cap tells ALL Earth's heroes to assemble I felt anyone, me, should have been there to fight as one."
5938,"I'm not going to include any spoilers, I'm just going to say: if you're a MCU fan and have enjoyed what Feig et al have achieved so far, WATCH THIS MOVIE. It is breathtaking, the perfect dénouement for Phase 3. Bravo Team MCU. 👍"
5939,What a way to end 10 years of marvel! Prepare yourself.
5940,Part of the journey is END. No movie can beat ENDGAME.
5941,Mind blowing................................................................................just loved it
5942,"I have stayed away from the internet so that I didn't get to find out any of the storyline and spoil watching the film. This film had a tough act to follow but overall I think it did. My only criticism is that it maybe tried to be too funny at times, Infinity war was a much darker film. You can't please everyone and some of the really low ratings and bad reviews on here are ridiculous, some people need to get a grip. Overall this is a great film, full of twists, action, surprises, emotion and humour. Judge for yourselves! If this truly is the end of the road for some of the main characters I'm curious as to the focus of future Marvel films."
5943,"Avengers: Endgame is the epicenter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie encapsulates everything that we have been waiting for since Iron Man. Because it is in fact a Marvel movie, the base level of quality is of course high. This includes acting, score, visual effects, cinematography, etc. Endgame is comparable to Infinity War except it does more. This movie shows our favorite Avengers at not only their lowest, but also at their highest both emotionally and physically. Hawkeye grows as a character, Rocket grows, Banner grows, Thor GROWS. Captain America gets an incredible amount of growth as a character as well but nowhere near as much as Tony Stark. The movie takes the characters we love so much and gives us a glimpse into what it feels to lose like they did. The plot is witty and engaging all the way through and the shifts in tone make sense and transition smoothly. My two gripes with this film which is very close to a 5/5 are the main antagonist that is fought at the very end of the film and the inclusion of Captain Marvel. In my opinion she is the only piece of this movie that seems out of place. If I were to describe this movie in only one word, that word would be epic."
5944,"Part of the journey is to end. Everyone has worked so hard for this movie , great conclusion and climax"
5945,"Either bitter DC fans or people with short attention spans seem to be dissing this magnificent film. In order to get the most from Endgame it really does require you to have seen most of the previous MCU films. It's emotional payoff is probably the most rewarding of any film I have ever seen. It's funny, it's sad, it's exciting at the same time. It's not perfect, no film is. Perfection doesn't exist. It's an unattainable construct. However I truly feel it is the best possible version of the final chapter of the MCU any fan could have asked for. Nuff said."
5946,"The build up, the Easter eggs, the story line across all 21 previous marvel movies have led to this moment and oh boy do they execute well. If you're a casual watcher you might not get why everyone loves this movie so much, which is unfortunate because you should really watch every movie in order before this to appreciate the entire story.[換行字元][換行字元]Probably the funniest marvel movie too (sorry guardians/ragnarok) but this movie made me laugh, cry, and had me on the edge of my seat. Thank you Russo brothers, thank you Kevin Feige, thank you to all the cast and crew I LOVE YOU 3000"
5947,The perfect ending to the Marvel Cinematic Universe

A: More or less- and they were high to begin with.[換行字元][換行字元]Q: How necessary is it to watch the previous Marvel movies before this one? A: Very.

A: No, but I'm jaded and wouldn't be surprised if other people did.[換行字元][換行字元]Q: Did you laugh? A: Yeah it was pretty funny, without sacrificing the more serious stuff.

5949,"I absolutely loved this film. It was wonderful. The CGI, the special effects, the character building, the emotional intensity, and the music are all absolutely amazing. One of my favourite movies ever"
5950,What a great end to this huge MCU saga. So much emotions that it would be hard to write it those in here.[換行字元][換行字元]I believe that Avengers Endgame will brake all movie records on earth.
5951,"I felt it the same theme as old movies, May be it is because I am not a hardcore fan of Avengers. Just can watch for time pass."
5952,"The beans were bakes properly. If there was way to make them as soft and warm as possible then this movie achieved it. It, however, does have flaws. It lacks scrambled lettuce."
5953,Ok. So. Endgame yaaay I am hyped goes to watch starts getting impatient. The pace was wayyyy tooo slow. Maybe this is because it is last movie of Phase 3? The movie was slow paced and then at the end everything rushed. IMO Infinith War was wayy better. I think it shouldve been half of the time length of the 3h.
5954,"I didn't think this could surpass Infinity War but the Russo Brothers did it. Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame managed to do it. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and I'll go so far as to say, maybe even the absolute pinnacle of the Marvel franchise. It's both hilarious and emotionally engaging (there were people crying at my theatre including me). And while it's a lot more character focused than Infinity War, as it should be considering this is the final hurrah for many of the original Avengers, that doesn't mean it's lacking In terms of visuals. The film is an absolute spectacle to behold, it easily tops Infinity War's action sequences in my opinion and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated.[換行字元][換行字元]10/10 best Marvel movie in my opinion. It's honestly hard for me to see how they'll ever be able to top this one."
5955,"I have more questions then answers. The ending felt rushed and the middle really added no value. But overall, it was a fun film with plenty of humor and some good action, although the action seemed too busy at times."
5956,The best superheroes movie a end of era for marvel was very good
5957,"If people are rating this film below 10 stars they must've not have seen it cos there's no way it's worth anything less. The acting , story, comedy, relationships, everything put together by the Russo brothers cannot be topped"
5958,"I like the way all the plots come together to please the Marvel nerds, but geez it's boring. It reminded me of star wars 2 (or was it 3?) just loads and loads of abysmal cgi. Smashing, punch, zapping. Lots of creatures, lots of people running around. I watched it over 3 nights, it was that shallow. Unlike some films you can't stop, this made me doze of. They must've spent the budget on the cast and left none for story or cgi. Some of the characters were so forgetful I don't even know who they are. Who's the guy that looks like jesus? who's the lady that has red glowing hands? I would look on imdb, but the cast is so big I can't be bothered."
5959,"Will apologize to all the fans, I am also a big comic adaptation fan, bit this one is really below my expectations. Too long, too slow, too much big actors... everything was too much. People started laughing in the cinema during some of the final scenes.[換行字元][換行字元]A must see but overall very weak"
5960,"Watch it and enjoy. End of the 23 films series. End of an era. That much suspence, twist. You gonna thoroughly enjoy it from the begining till the end."
5961,Amazing movie 10/10 would highly recommend watching this. 1 word breathtaking.
5962,"Let's be clear - there was a lot of talking about this film, about how great it will be. Turned out? It was a pretty decent story about time traveling (I honestly like those). I even thought I like it, aside from some little things that don't even worth mentioning. But the ending - oh, let me talk about the ending. It is so horrible that it erased any good impression this movie could've left. I don't have the problem with how it ends, with events presented. I have the problem with how boring, non-aesthetic and amateur it was filmed. I'm furious that funeral scene turned out to be such a cheap vulgarity, such an emptiness that tries to play with viewer's emotions - and, sadly, fails. This is what the character died for? To be honored... With this? Boy, oh boy. I don't know how many people actually like this scene, but I sure do not. Also - diversity. As a commercial product in the first place, a movie about diverse characters, well, completely non-diversed. Heteronormative, I would say, and in 2019 it is quite anachronistic. Quite obvious, of course, that the company is afraid of possible risks and profit losses - another reason to think about what good such soulless capitalistic approach can give us? From where I stand, nothing good. I don't want to be a consumer, I want to be a viewer that is not treated like a money account. Anyway, I was bitter about it just a little - after all, what can you expect from Marvel and Russos, really? They are not Taika Waititi after all (how honestly great it would be if Taika Waititi filmed all Avengers movies is story for another time), so even queer-coding isn't present. What got me furious is that Russo had the nerves to actually say they included LGBT-representation there. Leaving alone term ""LGBT-representation"" and why I have problems with this phrasing, let's see what we have here. And what we have, fellow viewers who don't enjoy tasteless similarity in their films, is a huge slap on our faces and our egos. This is what we can call a proper representation these days? I doubt it. It's so elusive I even didn't noticed it in the first place, thinking that the man could be talking about any people from his family. So, if I can read a text hermeneutically and headcanon some queer characters in there, does that mean a film has representation in it? Or, more important, does it mean director has the right to be bragging about such representation? Last one - certainly not."
5963,"Things you never expected take place in the movie, it takes us through a journey of all the characters. There is no such emotion which the movie lacks, right from humour,joy to grief. I'll definitely watch it over and over again. And last but not the least, thank you Avengers."
5964,"I can't even watch it since all the first 2 weeks are all booked in Georgia lol , can't even buy the damn tickets which makes me hyped to give it 10/10. Wasn't expecting that dang wow lol"
5965,"I am absolutely astounded by this film. I had really high expectations from this, given that I'm someone who has really watched the whole 21 movies several times throughout this 11 years, I thought it was going to be lackluster because I was expecting so much but Marvel truly surpassed every expectation I had for this one.[換行字元][換行字元]Every person, every hero that appeared, especially the Original 6 have completed story arcs that really puts a period to 21 movies. The first hour of the film really captured the emotions and the setting that the remaining characters are in after Infinity War but when things start to escalate in the 2nd Act, it really doesn't stop which is almost impossible to do and will just leave you breathless by the end of it.[換行字元][換行字元]I didn't know it ws possible to actually cry and cheer at the same time during a film but the cinema I was in really did that and it was a beautiful experience. While it was a complete visual feast, Marvel really went out that extra mile and tried to give a lot of fan service as much as they can without it being too overwhelming or feeling forced. Every inside joke and references felt right and served as a really fun easter egg for all the fans who has really invested in these movies.[換行字元][換行字元]The performances were all just wonderful too. No character outshined the others and no one fell behind. The audience could clearly see that these actors had really connected with their character in a way that it is not possible if you haven't played it several times. The performance from the Orignal 6 specifically, are really goosebumps inducing and gut-wrenching. The emotions displayed really allows the audience in and really connect with these characters.[換行字元][換行字元]Overall, I could just say that Avengers Endgame is the movie of this decade and justifiably the best Marvel movie out of 22 films. A true masterpiece and a really touching love letter to the fans from the creators."
5966,"This movie was a waste of time. I went to see this movie expecting something epic... more epic than Infinity War but was grossly disappointed. Movie was too slow, no action, much drama. I thought this was a comic movie? I wish I could give this movie 0/10."
5967,"Some says infinity war is the best marvel movie, but man, endgame tops everything. The last 1 hr of endgame is the best 1hr of entire marvel's history."
5968,"Avengers: Endgame is a satisfying, expertly made sequel in the franchise and combines with ""Infinity War"" to create the MCU's best, most compelling storytelling. I think that this movie raises the bar so high that there may well never be a superhero movie to match it as it stands out as one of the most detailed, satisfying conclusions to a chapter in a long-running franchise. All the necessary heroes get the right amount of screen time and there is a great blend of grief and humor. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a beautifully-constructed piece of popcorn cinema and anyone who has given their time to this world will find it to be a rewarding and effective payoff. The word epic is the right one for this movie. The end. nikisreviews.gr"
5969,"This movie is amzaing ,mindblowing everyone should watch this movie in theatres bcoz it is not that kind of a movie that u can watch on smartphone of television its real fun is in theatres so i highly recommend you to go and watch it. This movie really lives upto the hype. There are also so many twist and turns that u have never expected and also packed with humor and fun😢😊😊"
5970,They've really scrapped the bottom with this one! Oh so Bad!
5971,The best superhero movie ever. You really need to watch this. i've watched it after finishing MCU challenge( watch all MCU movies in order) even i watched them before. So i was very exited to watch endgame. And my expectaction was very high. But i bet you! Endgame will be fat better than your expectaction. There is no way to not to rate it 10/10.!! I Dont understand why some ppl rating it under 10
5972,"Is an historical event, a changing life experience, gamechanger"
5973,"I've never cried so much in anything (well, since Bambi in 1992), amazing film. I can't give away any details, but it's just perfect"
5974,This is the best movie I have ever seen! This movie is such a love letter to the fans of Marvel. I have never had so much emotion drawn from me in a movie. The story is so amazing and a beautiful way to end the Marvel Infinity Saga.
5975,"I can only say that I enjoyed this movie far more than I did Infinity War. I've never appreciated the Russo brothers and their work, because I think they're more into profit than quality. This movie was nothing but another reminder of that. Endgame, like all other Marvel movies, uses a blend of comedy and action to tell an epic story. This movie in particular succeeds in ways that past movies haven't - especially when compared to Infinity War. Marvel movies always do a debatably good job with following through on such an emotional journey for their heroes, and Endgame really only does that best for Thor and for Tony. Also, who could forget about America's ass? That's almost enough to make me give Endgame a ten out of ten. But seriously, this movie really wasn't worth the hype. I'm mad about multiple things that I believe were handled incorrectly, Thor's weight being a main one. So many characters were written out of character, Steve/Cap being the biggest one, that it makes you truly wonder whether the Russo brothers have ever actually seen a Marvel movie in their lives."
5976,"11 years and 21 movies later, this movie marks the conclusion of the greatest and the longest franchise ever. It's a culmination of everything from good, bad, fun, anger, sadness, thrill, action, drama, suspense to a nerve bursting but a satisfying ending. Stan Lee's cameo stands out to be the best so far. The story comes a full circle and ties up a lot of loose ends, but creates new one's in the process. Hats-Off to each and every single one who dedicated more than a decade of their life to this magnificent saga that we have all come to love and cherish. Kevin Feige - you are the man!! Looking forward to the next big thing from MCU. I hope they bring in the big guns for whatever comes next. A rebooted version of wolverine joining Spider-Man's adventures - now that's something we can look forward to."
5977,Go watch it won't reveal much. It's very well done.
5978,Its been the most amazing cinematic EXPERIENCE of my life . love you 3000 MARVEL[換行字元][換行字元]the Endgame could have gone minutely wrong by making more repetitive jokes but the way they improvised is just insane and epic
5979,"This movie will change your life. Honestly though, Marvel did a good job bringing this saga to an end. I am Iron Man."
5980,"This movie is.. well in short amazing! It has so much expectation being the culmination of 21 films before it and having to live up to those sky high expectations but man oh man does this movie deliver. Imagine the best possible ending to this Infinity Saga then multiply it by 10 and that's what Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely were able to write up for this movie. It surpassed all of my expectations and I can't understate this enough my expectations going into this movie were already sky high. If you've like me have seen all the previous MCU movies multiple times and just love them all (yes including Thor Dark World) then this movie will blow you away, it is the ultimate thank you letter to MCU fans. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie! More than once."
5981,More wonderful movie Enjoy every moment my feelings intertwined
5982,The best movue seen so far. it has everything from comedy to so much emotional scenes the movie has everything
5983,Infinity war is perfect movie but end game is not so good
5984,Endgame nicely sums up all the previous films to give a satisfying end to a wonderful saga of movies. Couldn't asked for any more. Thank you Russos and all the production team and cast.
5985,Love will keep us together / Love will tear us apart
5986,"After the decimation of half the universe at the hands of Thanos, the Avengers must fight to restore order to the universe once and for all in the conclusion to an 11-year, 22-film-long journey through the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[換行字元][換行字元]If you've ever felt like all these shared universes and year-long franchises have been leading up to something, then, well, it's here. The moment fans have been waiting for since 2008 has finally arrived, culminating an already enormous franchise in a gigantic finale that's everything I wanted it to be and more. It's the most shocking and emotional movie out of the entire superhero genre, but also brings all the excitement and fun Marvel knows for while having a more somber tone than most Marvel films as well. This movie brings eleven years of cinema in a cinematic event that pays off every minute dedicated to waiting for, watching, and discussing Marvel films over the years. If you think you could get away with only watching a few of the previous films before this one, then you're wrong - in order to truly grasp the substance of Endgame like the movie wants you to, you are required to watch every film from the Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor trilogies to all the other connected adventures such as Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Captain Marvel, and of course, the first three Avengers film. After all, it has been an eleven-year adventure and, to be honest, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been the center of popular culture for as long as I've known about it and have been following it. In case you don't know, I've seen every Marvel movie in theaters since 2012 and this franchise has always had a special place in my heart. This movie is one that everyone can love, but simply going to see Endgame without any prior knowledge won't bring you as much joy and emotional payoff as that which so many fans in my theater, including myself, experienced when watching this film. The performances are all spectacular, including Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans reprising their beloved roles as the leading names of the Avengers, which have easily become the greatest characters in modern cinema. The movie does a wonderful job continuing every character arc from the previous films but still takes characters in unexpected directions, which may be why characters like Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Thor are such highlights as well. Every actor wonderfully reminds us why they were so perfect from the role, including the previously mentioned actors, as well as Mark Ruffalo who is always so enjoyable as Bruce Banner. Not to mention Paul Rudd, who is perfect comedic relief but also delivers a terrific performance overall as his character Scott Lang, better known as Ant-Man. Another character I was very impressed by is Nebula, who originates from the Guardians of the Galaxy films and is most deeply connected to Thanos from all the characters in the film. Nebula's arc has always intrigued me though many have overlooked it, and the script takes advantage of what makes her great very well and transforms her into a real hero, as opposed to her darker, villainous personality when her journey began in Guardians of the Galaxy. Telling you who else is in the film would already be a spoiler, but every cast member that does appear in the movie perfectly utilized and is very much welcomed every minute they're on screen.[換行字元][換行字元]Remember when Avengers: Infinity War came out and everyone called it a cinematic landmark because of the incomparable scale and stakes? Well, Avengers: Endgame succeeds at topping that scale by creating something even more unimaginably enormous and climactic. Moments fans have awaited for years and buildup waiting to be payed off, it's all rewarded here in scenes you would never think to picture in your head but finally can. Audiences will continuously clap and cheer as the past films are referenced and heroes do awesome things you've always wanted them to do. This movie made me react like no movie before, and I had a huge smile on my face in some scenes that I just couldn't get rid of. Even after twenty-two films, Marvel takes unexpected directions that you wouldn't have thought of but still remain true to the long-lasting story arcs. This results in an emotionally surreal experience where you cannot tell what will happen next, or if Hollywood can ever top such a glorious event. The way Endgame handles its story serving as a climax of eleven years of cinema and as a 3-hour movie lover's dream, well, it convinces me that this is the peak of filmmaking history here. Every movie in history has always promised to ""up the ante"", but after Endgame, it's hard to see how the scale, stakes, and weight of this film can ever be topped. But that's not a bad thing. Maybe it just means that we lived in the right time, to witness such a grand phenomenon unfold in front of our eyes, and that we'll be able to tell those who come after us of the adventure we went on with these characters over the years, and the conclusion of their stories that we see here, wrapped up terrifically in one of the greatest superhero movie endings of all time, which in turn helps make up the greatest superhero movie, and one of the most astonishing action movies and blockbusters put to film in this day and age.[換行字元][換行字元]Avengers: Endgame is a cinematic event that must be witnessed on the big screen, marking the end of an era for Marvel but one that still exceeds expectations with fantastic writing, emotional value, nostalgia, and visuals and set pieces that will be remembered for the rest of however long superhero and action movies continue to be made. Thank you, Marvel Studios, for making such a sensational universe and making the experience of being a fan an unforgettable one. I'm sure more people can agree with me on that than Thanos can snap away. You've definitely already heard of Avengers: Endgame and now that you know why you should see it, what are you waiting for? 10/10"
