"I like superhero flicks. Being honest though, there is a certain 'sameness' to most of them. Avengers: Endgame could be called the granddaddy of all superhero movies, I suppose. At just a touch over 3 hours long, it is certainly far longer than most. It probably features more superheroes than most too. At one point, I think every Marvel superhero that ever existed was on screen - (except, curiously, the X-Men). Yes, a lot of time, effort, creativity and money - lots of money - went into this. Sadly, it left me feeling kind of flat. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but I didn't love it. In fact, I didn't feel anything when it was over - no sadness at the losses incurred, no exhilaration at the victories. Nothing. I never found myself on the edge of my seat once. This may have been Marvel's great battle-of-our-time movie, but it was no Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (now THAT was a movie that pulled you in!). So, I guess we're left asking where to now Marvel? Do we care? I know I'll keep watching what you put out, but the lustre is starting to wear thin.",1,neg,neg,neg,pos,XXXXXX
"Convenient how they had managed to come up with a time portal disregarding the fact that one of the infinity stones had done just that. This movie is overrated, and pretty much not worth the trip to the theatre.",2,neg,neg,neg,neg,
"The most complete hero movie I ever seen. Full of emotions and loves. Make hero seem vulnerable and as human as us. And yet make the sacrifice as the last resort Good job marvel , the thing is we will be expecting a higher ceiling next time and I think it's difficult to raise. A really emotional journey for me has ended.",3,pos,pos,pos,pos,

The fight scenes and graphics were incredible! What a great way to end it really.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The only little things that irritated me was that I was hoping the 'full' Hulk came to play as he is a lot more powerful than they portray him in the Marvel movies. Also... Captain Marvel comes across very arrogant and smug like 'yes we know... you are super powerful and you know it'. I know Iron Man is very arrogant as well but he makes it into a positive as its funny and likeable![?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and for all of you that haven't seen it yet... get the tissues ready!",5,pos,pos,pos,pos,

One should just stop at Avengers Infinity War and not watch this stupid movie. One of the worst movies of this series.,7,neg,neg,neg,neg,

They take a sci-fi trope that always causes problems due to logic issues and went full steam ahead with it. The first two hours of the movie were quite unexpected, and by that I mean underwhelming, for the final movie in a decade long storyline.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The movie comes into its own and gives the fanbase geekgasms about 20 minutes to the end, but it wasn't enough in my opinion. I have rated it a 7 as I truly enjoyed the way it concluded.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]There were a couple of scenes that made me laugh, but if as I wrote earlier, the final 20 - 30 minutes of Endgame are better than the previous 2 and a half hours of it, as there are too many flaws in logic and even the directors and screenwriters are not on the same page in their interviews as to how things are supposed to work.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I won't bother with a suggestion of should you go see it or not, but unless you are truly blinded by love for the franchise, don't expect a masterpiece or the best film from Marvel so far.",13,neg,neg,neg,neg,

But after SOOOOOOOO many of them I'm over it - and this movie didn't really help that. There was nothing new here: the same cliched lines, the same tears and long stares and fancy speeches, the same rivalries started and finished and referred to with a gentle (yet sickening) smile... You get the idea. It was good, but in a boring, ""I've seen this before"" kind of way. I truly hope this is the end of these massive big production movies for a while.",30,neg,neg,neg,neg,
"I don't know how they were able to keep things so cohesive. This is, arguably, part 22 of the longest story telling in the history of film. It so good and so intricate. There isn't a moment where you are bored but to understand all that's going on, at a minimum, you should watch Infinity Wars, Captain Marvel first... but to enjoy the full maximum benefit you really should watch all the Marvel films.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I'm going to keep this spoiler free because I hate spoilers and besides...no one should be reading any reviews if you are planning on seeing this.

Bradley Cooper'S Rocket is just a brilliant piece of voice acting. Chris Evans is the ultimate hero.

And it is a must see on the big screen.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I just realize I didn't really review the film in the typical sort of review but I can say that there are moments in the film where the audience cheered and you didn't mind. This is the Super Bowl of super hero films. I like the way they wrapped it up. And i bet it receives a Best Picture nod. It will not win but it will be nominated. It definitely will clean up in all the technical categories.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]God, I'm going to miss all of this. Going to see a Marvel movie or two, every year... i can't wait to own it so I can host a marathon.

"I managed to attend a double bill of this and Infinity War last night with Endgame being the midnight movie. Going to a midnight showing takes alot of effort as you are disrupting your working week to watch a movie until 3 am, but it seems to be the only way to avoid having the movie spoiled. Was it worth the upheaval? In short yes. This definitely delivers as the franchise closer. This is a very dark movie at the beginning and while their is alot going on story wise (there are alot of character story arcs to deal with) it feels like a resolution to the overall narrative. This could be problematic for some people who haven't seen every movie in the franchise as stories are resolved from characters origins movies. As is the standard with this franchise the action scenes and effects are so well done that watching other superhero movies can pale in comparison. The blending of the different character universes is seamless and the fun is watching the interactions of the characters. All action, twists, humour and emotion which you have come to expect in these movies is here. If you have managed to resist looking for spoilers online then see it as soon as possible, because people will want to discuss this movie. If you are the type of actively went looking for them then you may have ruined the movie for yourself as one of the numerous rumoured plot lines is real. You only have yourself to blame. Endgame doesn't have the same heavyweight emotional punch that Infinity War does but they were never going to top THAT ending. Although there were men crying in the screening I attended and tried to pretend they weren't. This appears to be a definite ending to this particular story arc as there is NO post credit scene, so you are know equipped with the knowledge to beat the crowds at the end. No spoilers and a handy tip? You don't get that from every IMDB reviewer!",32,pos,neg,pos,pos,
"I can understand the feeling of MCU fans but the movie didn't have the impact, as IW. I didn't expect IW to be a good movie, so I had high hopes from Endgame, but it didn't turn out to be that great. Acting was spot on, but felt draggy in between with jokes here and there. War sequence was rushed, there wasn't any wow factor in during that scene. Ending was fine. Ye fans would love it.",33,neg,pos,neg,neg,

I loved infinity war so i thought maybe this one was gonna be a bit of a disappointment, but no it was even better. The acting was great as well the CGI. The first two hours were fun to watch but the last hour was amazing, I had goosebumps all the time.",38,pos,pos,pos,pos,
"Going into this movie, we all knew it was Chris Evans and RDJ's last Marvel movie. In my opinion, these two guys defined the MCU and helped make it what it is today. The real question became how they were going to exit the MCU and let me just say that Endgame delivered and was the perfect last movie for them.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Endgame wrapped up 11 years of jaw-dropping movies into one 3-hour cinematic masterpiece. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]When you go into this movie, just remind yourself of where this journey started. This may be the last movie for Evans and RDJ but it's a whole new beginning for our new heroes.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Thank you, Marvel and every actor and actress who made this movie the best one yet",39,pos,pos,pos,pos,
"I can't even describe how good Avengers Endgame is without spoiling it, which I won't. It wraps up a 11 year saga of 22 movies perfectly. Call backs to (almost) every movie. I laughed, I cheered and cried. Someone actually spoiled the end for me and it was still such a enjoyable movie. The Russo brothers understand that story is more important that cool VFX and one liners. It has drama, suspense and amazing action. I will say this though. You need to see every movie in order to enjoy it completely. And remember #dontspoiltheendgame",40,pos,pos,pos,pos,
"Avengers Endgame is the conclusion to 11 years worth of MCU build up. A 3 hour long epic superhero adventure packed with eye candy action and emotional moments that suffers from a few minor inconsistencies in story and characters. The promotional material has been incredibly vague and therefore I'll keep it too with this review too to not ruin the fun. After the 'events' of Infinity War, the Avengers are forced to reassemble and take on Thanos (Josh Brolin) once more. That's all I'll say about the plot. I was genuinely surprised with the direction that was taken for many characters. Unlike Infinity War, the heroes are in front center this time. There were genuine arcs that made me love and feel for these characters yet again and all of the actors were fantastic. Robert Downey jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Chris Hemsworth are at the centre of this movie and there characters were all the best, emotional and surprising for me. Especially Ruffalo lightened up the mood with a comedic performance. At this point the chemistry and comradeship between the Avengers is undeniably the best part of these films. Just seeing these characters on screen talking and interacting was truly amazing. The conversations and relationships they share with each other is vital to the films success and it absolutely delivers. The humour is on point, the dialogue snappy and real and the fight just as brutal and significant as before. All other actors too gave very effective performance but I will admit that there were two that disappointed me a little. Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) and surprisingly Josh Brolin (Thanos). I haven't seen Captain Marvel but the use of her character in Endgame didn't do much for me. She had no personality and Larson (a terrific actress) didn't have the inviting charisma that a Scarlett Johansson has. Whilst he stole the show in Infinity War, Brolin's Thanos is merely reduced to a big evil villain in this film. I get that most of the screen time and story was dedicated to the Avengers and that Infinity War was Thanos' movie. But if I'm supposed to judge Endgame as a film on its own, his character definitely felt underused. Some jumbled story parts that best shouldn't be overly analysed aside. Avengers Endgame is an absolutely experience from start to finish. Perhaps the best film in the MCU yet I don't know how they can possibly top this. Wrapped up with a nice bow and tie, Endgame is a satisfying blockbuster for all fans of the MCU and superhero films in general.",41,pos,pos,pos,pos,

Marvell had a challenge to finish a great 11-year stage and 22 films that had a great viewing experience may have some small mistakes. I expected more than some characters. But I'm happy at this end I do not expect it could have been better deserves 10/10 because it was a big challenge and has won the challenge It should not be compared with less effortless films Do not direct this great challenge and should not be compared with the infinity war because this film is a complement to the film The Infinite War,43,pos,pos,pos,pos,

It ties up a lot of loose ends and has a relatively satisfying ending.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Infinity War was an extremely tough act to follow, and sadly these writers could not end it very well. The movie is simply too long. Don't try to put what happens in the movie in context and you will enjoy it.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]If you try to think things through and consider what is going on in the movie, you will never be surprised about anything that happens. All the typical Hollywood writer cues are there if you pay attention.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The writers also did the typical thing and borrowed ideas from other sci-fi movies. Remember when Spider-Man in Civil War used his web shooters a la Empire Strikes Back? Or when he killed Thanos goon in Infinity War by invoking Aliens? This movie constantly does that as if Peter Parker was helping write the script.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Also very disappointed with the Captain Marvel treatment. More of the same from her movie. She is super powerful yet seems so limited in her imagination of how to use her powers.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]No spoilers. RDJ was great, as was Hemsworth.

I was a bit excited for this title given that I really like the previous one but I ended up a bit disappointed... It's often very versatile from one Marvel to another.

"MARVEL movies are action flicks predominantly, this one took the gamble of character development and bringing in raw emotions in much of the movie, while the fight scene towards the end was choreographed brilliantly, somehow the movie didn't work on the drama level, and time travel concepts are always a risky bet, and somehow in the end, it did not come of as well, at the end of the day. Avengers End Game is a fitting tribute to all the major characters, but it certainly did not live up the expectation that was delivered in its previous installment.",50,pos,pos,pos,neg,XXXXXX
The Russo brothers did a bang up job wrapping up the entirety of what has become the MCU so far. The action scenes are very well done. The humor is admittedly hit-or-miss. But the acting from the all star cast (and there's a gigantic cast here) is very good. It includes some of the best character work in the MCU series in years. The final battle scene (shut up that's not a spoiler) is fan service galore. I think the concluding moments will be quite satisfying to many comics movie fans.,51,pos,pos,pos,pos,

"I've just returned from watching Avengers: Endgame on opening night. As a fan of Marvel for over three decades I had many expectations and thoughts about what this movie might bring, and this movie was nothing that I expected. It brought us both the best (and worst in my opinion) versions of Earth's mightiest heroes. And I'm sure that many out there will disagree with me on which is which. What is undeniable is that the Russo's have managed to achieve what many (including myself) thought impossible, to deliver a film which pays tribute to the past decade's 21 (not including Endgame itself) Marvel Cinematic Universe offerings, whilst simultaneously closing out the story lines and creating an epic masterpiece in itself. It has humour (some of good), action, emotion and genuinely something for everyone all rolled up into an epic three hours of entertainment, which goes by in a flash.

"Best way to describe a three hour venture without recklessly diving into spoiler territory. The movie excels best at its central element of time travel, which is rather where the momentum is truly its natural best. The characters are all rounded, perhaps more so here than Infinity War. This is likely a fair take on what results now as a quadrilogy than a trilogy. When the action really gets to its peak level, it's almost effortless with the buildup doing every bit of the talking. The most curious turnout is the studio's first ever movie to be well over three hours, which to be frank could have succeeded with more than the overall result in this movie. Just a thought at hand, rest assured the pacing eventually comes to a fitting close that won't underwhelm the overall theme of what's termed the Infinity Saga. The emotion and depth really get to how things play out, also a bit improvised over Infinity War and in the viably greater ways. Got to lose a point for how it uses fan service done right as a sendoff to breeze through the buildup process up to the key parts that make this movie the ultimate conclusion it will be for a long time. My favorite of the Russo brothers' directed movies remains Civil War, simply because it was a Captain America movie of all the flicks back then that really pushed hard to reach a well deserved billion mark. This might get there a little too easily. Duh, but noteworthy. Give or take eleven years and twenty two movies, which as I mention is twice its bargain. Facing Thanos the second time really says something, which is likely all to consider about it.",60,pos,pos,pos,pos,

The details can be mailable, so long as a core theme is adhered to.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I walked into Endgame today having no idea what could happen, and no preconceptions about what should happen.

Infinity War was one of my favorite movies when it came out. I was mesmerized by the amount of material packed into those two and a half hours of runtime, but Endgame put all that to shame. The three hours of runtime gave the movie a lot of leeway with the plot, and it put all that to good use. It almost felt like two or three movies packed into one.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]It does have a few flaws, however (although not severe enough to remove a star). A lot of different things were happening at once, leaving me somewhat discombobulated, although not too much.

The plot is slow, obvious, and kind-of bad honestly, but the action is good, especially the final action scene.

There's several things that make this movie work so beautifully, first and foremost the writing. The Avengers interact better than ever, going from a team to sounding like best friends. They are united by their bond, by their loss and they all feel a moral and ethical duty to do everything and anything in their power to fix what Thanos did, last seen in Infinity War.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The other thing that makes this movie work so great is that there's a point to which the Avengers are at their lowest point... like they look like they are on the verge of absolute defeat... then suddenly... SUDDENLY... something happens and when it does it's the most amazing feeling in the world for us, the audience.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Markus/Mcfeely and the Russos know how to create great tension, which keeps you on the end of your seat and wondering... what's going to happen next?!

So, love the movie and the extra (slow pacing) bits, or move on.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]In the end, without spoilers, go in empty minded, without as much expectation as you can. I've watched every single Marvel film out and I loved this movie, even with the slow parts.

And boy, did they do that![?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]It's not a ""10"" for thee ""perfect"" movie. But man, the audience was clapping, cheering, 'ooohs,' and 'ahhhhs' throughout.

"This was an adventurous superhero drama. The best movie I've seen this year. The actors and actresses have found their characters role and their characters relationship towards eachother. This was partly the reason I couldn't enjoy Avengers 1, 2 or Civil War, they had an unnatural holywood-forced story to tell which I just didn't find realistic. Instead of cheesy oneliners the movie explores character depth, there is a superb believable acting, a riveting story and most important of all an entertaining musicscore. At the end my critical brain was asking questions like, why couldn't n.n. do that or how did n.n. do that? This doesn't really matter when you look at the whole picture. The movie delievered one of the most enjoyable emotional experience I've had watching a movie.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]This is one of those movies I could watch a second time. So much details was squeezed into this movie I felt like I must have missed some of them...[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]A tip before you see this movie is to watch the clips of each individual background story of the superheroes cause you will get a deeper understanding and connection to the movie.

"Avengers: Endgame is about memories, nostalgia and tons of fan-service moments. This is a movie that understands its audience and fans, trying to give each character's story closure without forgetting to provide valuable entertainment for the whole crowd. It also might be a tad too cheesy for some people's taste, particularly when there's a comedic relief scene.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]My biggest concern coming into this movie was the insertion of bland and uninspired jokes that plagued my overall solid experience in ""Infinity War"". This film was an improvement in that regard but it isn't without its cringe-inducing moments. Things like the ""Fortnite"" scene (and more than that I won't say) just made me roll my eyes. It's unbelievable how they manage to overkill it with these comedic scenes that are so painfully unnecessary and do nothing to advance the plot. I understand that you're trying to make your audience have a good time and all, but this is just unbearable.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Other than that, the comedy - I thought - worked just nicely for the most part. The jokes that existed didn't ruin the tension.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The characters were very central in this movie. Some characters shined; others not so much. I didn't like ""Captain Marvel"" and I certainly don't like the titular character, so I was grateful that she was underused in this movie. Everytime she's on screen and she smiles at the camera, it feels as though the actress is trying to show charisma, but there's none whatsoever. Not that the actress is awful - it's simply that she is not as interesting as the writers are portraying her to be. I know some critics enjoyed Chris Hemsworth's performance and the character, but it's sad to see that the character is reduced to a comedic relief (again).[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The movie also boasts an impressive budget, with so many set-pieces and computer-generated effects to be observed. This element of the movie provided the writers with so many angles to explore the story. While ""Avengers: Endgame"" is three hours long, the narrative is entertaining enough to overcome the more stale sequences. The movie never feels dull and it keeps you in the edge of your seat.

Totally anti climactic after Infinity Wars and Thor Ragnarok. The direction Marvel has chosen after Captain Marvel and Now this.

"Note : This is a NON SPOILER REVIEW and just a discussion in general.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Movie : Avengers Endgame Cast : Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Bradley Cooper, Josh Brolin & many more. Running Time: 3Hrs 2minutes[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I don't know where to start. Reviewing this movie is beyond my expertise, but I'll just say what's on my mind. First things first, use the washroom before the movie starts because there's no interval in this 3h 2m movie and you do not want to miss any single minute of this gem of a movie.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]It's been just over a decade since MARVEL STUDIOS launched its flagship with 2008's Iron Man and ever since then movie experience has changed for us. Being a movie fan I cannot imagine a world without MARVEL movies. I mean being a 90's kid I've grown up with these MARVEL characters. It's part of us now and we'll feel a void if they aren't there anymore. After 10 years and 21 films the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes to an end with The Avenger: Endgame.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Endgame only has one real job: to move the MCU forward past Infinity War's climactic horror. Every moment of Endgame feels like it was made with that in mind - to convey the audience past the shock and into grief, anger, hope, and tremendous excitement. It was made for the kind of fans that will collectively gasp in shock at every significant twist (and there are a few huge ones), then cheer in relief at every climactic blow for the future integrity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The entire film is constructed of callbacks, references, reminders, and reminiscences. So if you're one of those people who has never seen a MARVEL movie before, and is watching the Endgame just for the hype then you might get confused as to what's happening. You know we had these scrapbooks before where our friends used to write stuffs about us. If you still have that then that's Endgame for you. The Endgame is like MCU's scrapbook or an anniversary project.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]All the other MARVEL movies were so brilliantly made that you could watch it as a standalone movie, but not endgame. Endgame was never designed to stand on its own as a single well-crafted movie, and it was never designed to follow the MCU formula. It was designed to cap a decade of buildup around a single gigantic story. So, you might wanna see some previous MARVEL movies in order to understand this one. You've got to watch ""The Avengers, Captain America: The first Avenger , Thor: The Dark World , Civil War, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Infinity War""[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]This Endgame is all about the original Avengers. I'm not saying that others don't have a role, they have, they definitely play huge part in the end game, but it all revolves around the originals. You will see them doing stuffs which you cannot even imagine, but must have definitely wondered at some point.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The Endgame was one of the fastest 3 hours of my life. I never looked at my watch once because it's very hard to take your eyes off the big screen. It really has been an epic ride and I feel privileged to have been able to be a part of it. Though only being an audience, I feel connected to these characters, they are like long know friends. Endgame is the epic and monumental end to the saga which began over a decade ago. And oh it is more than worthy to be the last milestone on this incredible journey.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The trailers are deceptive so don't believe them as you have no idea what you're going to witness. A colossal conclusion, a proper ending for an epic saga. It brought you to the beginning; it reminded you of all the years you have invested. Then boom, here is the dessert that makes you overwhelmed and craved at the same time.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The Russo's have crafted a masterpiece and set a benchmark for other Studios. The Endgame is a perfect conclusion to the MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE. You couldn't have asked for more. The ending is so satisfyingly emotional that you can't help but give a standing ovation.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I would like to just add another thing; there are no end credits (this isn't a spoiler), so it would be really helpful for the people who are cleaning your mess after you've watched the movie, to finish their work quickly. Endgame is running 24x7 and you've got to respect the theatre staff as they're working like crazy. Don't keep waiting as there are others MARVEL fans who are impatiently waiting outside the theatre for their show to start.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Verdict: A MUST WATCH 6 / 5 stars.

"This is by far the worst MCU movie I've ever seen. Ever.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I was looking forward to it after last year's Infinity War, to see how they would bounce back from that Thanos snap. But boy, was I disappointed. The whole ""time heist"" plot is tortuously senseless, it lacks any form of intelligence from any aspect, be it scientific or imaginative. What kind of ""writers"" are responsible for this? Or what were they on while ""writing"" this? The quick one-liners, barbs and quips are cringe-worthy and so are the ""comedic"" situations.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]One can objectively agree that the movie is way too long and boring for the first two hours, even my 11 yo super-fan brother thought so. It offers very little entertainment. The plot is too incoherent for any sensible adults and very complex to follow for the young ones so they just eagerly await the battle finale. Which does arrive at the end in the form of a badly choreographed CGI bukake scene with pyrotechnics and many, many cuts for anyone to follow what the heck is going on.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Massive, glaring plot-holes abound from start to finish which I bet are invisible to the throngs of fanboys all over the world over-hyping and claiming this piece of hot, leaky garbage to be the greatest movie ever made. Along with giving it over the top reviews and ratings.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Can't believe this is what sells to the masses and makes studios billions of dollars now. Makes me lose all hope in future superhero movies. I couldn't wait for it to get over and go home. A complete waste of time.",208,pos,pos,pos,pos,

"The end of an era, Endgame wraps up the Infinity Saga in epic fashion, with massive fan service, emotional gravitas, a darker Thanos, psychological war-aftermath reflection, & one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster history. 9.4/10.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]...[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]10 years, 21 movies, 32 heroes. The MCU as we know it just came to an end, and did so as epically as one could have possibly expected. Avengers: Endgame is one of, if not THE best and definitive Marvel film - and absolutely warrants the hype.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The film opens into a desolate landscape post-Infinity War where our heroes are still coming to terms with the magnitude of their failure. Despite glimpses of levity-full psychological war aftermath reflection on topics like survivor's guilt and PTSD, I'll admit: I was mildly disappointed with the first act. Overly comedic and light-defused in tone, it's a bit discordant with the tragic events that just happened to trillions of life forms. It was also a bit anticlimactic having them find and confront Thanos so easily and early. However, these flaws are mostly sequestered in the first third (despite a weird intellectual Hulk and fat Thor just horrifying to watch), and are ~easily forgiven in light of what follows.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Everything after the first act is masterful, dazzling fan service on a massive scale that will leave any Marvel or superhero fan speechless with their jaw-dropped. The middle act's time travel plotting makes for some incredible scenarios visiting past MCU films and having heroes interacting with their past selves. This was the magic of DC's Flashpoint comic arc, and although the film borrows its idea, it executes it perfectly. Thrillingly paced are the signature smooth-fluid action sequences The Russo Brothers are known for and exhibited ever since The Winter Soldier, as well as strong direction and intricate handling of such a monstrous scale of a story arc trying to beat Thanos before he even knows what's happened.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The Avengers once again find solace in the splitting up of them into mini-teams leading to some hilarious and intriguing character combinations different from Infinity War. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye now Ronin, and the rest of the original 6 (plus a few others) are sent off into different teams and time periods to retrieve the stones, and it makes for some incredible entertainment value alone worth the price of admissions to watch. The Easter Eggs and cameos are downright legendary, showcasing what we already learned in IW: Anthony and Joe Russo are huge Marvel junkies who know and love the films/comics as much as the person reading this review.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Thanos and his far darker tone. Thanos is also off scouring for the Stones while all this is happening. His pulling of the strings in things like sending rogues and strategically planting things to upset the Avengers' plans make him far more imposing than his rogue commando style in IW. Much akin to what Darkseid - DC's original titan/god that came out first and, yes, Thanos was cloned from - would be like, there's far more power in resources at your disposal and being able to fling them at your will. He also has a bite and far darker tone here, being pissed off The Avengers are wrecking his plans after knowing he won and promising to not only kill half of life now, but ALL life and start over again under his rule.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Finally, the final act. I cannot even find the words to describe how legendary the final act of Endgame is - it might be one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster HISTORY. Like the Wakanda war on acid, this massive scale battle starting with the three most iconic Avengers against Thanos and evolving into a sheer epic warzone with every Marvel character you could possibly imagine, it will leave any fan speechless. And that's nothing compared to the heart-breaking ending with sacrifices that do the characters proud and have potentially-massive implications for the future of the MCU.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Overall, while there are nits to pick from its ~anticlimactic humorous opening to its handling of Thor/Hulk to its lack of a post-credits scene (REALLY wanted an X-Men or Eternals tease..), Avengers: Endgame is an absolutely masterful film that delivers just about everything you could expect from it as a follow-up to Infinity War. The end of an era, Avengers: Endgame wraps up the Infinity Saga in epic fashion, with massive fan service, emotional gravitas, a darker Thanos, psychological war aftermath reflection, and one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster HISTORY. It will be dang near impossible to wait to see what comes next.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Overall Score: 9.4/10",213,pos,pos,pos,pos,

Seriously; if it were a fetish, you would enjoy yourself TOO much.[?›è?å­—å?]It abides so Well to the continuity and is believable in its world.

"Over 10 years of action packed and engaging Marvel superheroes, the endgame is finally here-Avengers: Endgame is a stellar movie about such topics as loss, revenge, responsibility, and learning from mistakes made, and moving on from them.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The leading cast is Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, and Bradley Cooper, playing Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, and Rocket (among other actors, respectively). The directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, return from the many Marvel films they have directed previously.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The film itself is not the usual Marvel film; it's three hours long, and features many new plot twists and techniques to make it stand out among the other films. Going into it, expect some slight deviation from the traditional Marvel formula-like comparing Infinity War to the original The Avengers. It's set after the events of Avengers: Infinity War, and deals with the losses that the remaining Avengers suffer in their quest to renew themselves, by the means that they choose.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The music and scenes of the film are crisp and beautiful. Color always fills every frame of this film; almost like eye-candy in a motion picture. The action is amazing, and will leave you breathless at some points. Along with the orchestral music in the background, scenes can be very upbeat or even bring viewers to tears. It overall builds on the foundation that Infinity War had laid out a year ago, and is similar in some of its structure.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Although, there is one complaint that audiences and myself generally find after viewing. Its plot at times can be a bit spotty, leading viewers to question some of the decisions and actions. And the first quarter to half starts out a bit slow for a Marvel movie. But near the end of the film, most of these thoughts begin to dissipate. The last hour of this movie is raw action, and a setting and place where the stakes couldn't be higher.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The hype for this movie has been building since last year, and translated into it grossing $1.2 billion at the box office in its opening weekend alone, smashing previous Hollywood records by a wide margin. It's set to be one of the highest grossing movies of all time, along with Titanic, Avatar, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. And with its average rating of 87% across the main three movie review boards (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and RedBox), this certainly is an above average film considering other options.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]While this movie might not be for everyone, it can be interesting to even a casual movie viewer, and all the more interesting to someone who likes Marvel or superhero movies in general. The movie can both make you laugh and cry in the span of just a couple of scenes-truly an emotional experience for some.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The culmination of more than 10 years of Marvel films have built up to this amazing movie, and it's definitely worth it.

"Avengers: Endgame is the fourth Avengers film and the newest film from the Marvel film series. The film is directed by the Russo brothers, who also directed the previous Avengers film Avengers: Infinity War.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]After the actions of Thanos (Josh Brolin) from the previous Avengers movie, the remaining Avengers have to deal with the consequences of their loss. Still, the Avengers must eventually look for a way to defeat Thanos and see if there is a way to undo his dark actions.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]With this fourth Avengers film, the Russo brothers and scriptwriters were able to put a nice end to the eleven-year series of 22 films. The Russo brothers have also done their best to fill the film further with things that Marvel fans would like to see or they provide answers to some unanswered questions from previous Marvel films. For most Marvel fans this film can come across as a satisfactory ending. Although this film comes across as the end of the series, they have left enough free space for the next phase of the Marvel film series. They have already planned some new films and TV series for the future. Although they have these new plans, these new films will probably no longer be able to reach the same level as they did with Avengers Endgame and the eleven-year build-up to this film. Despite these future plans, they do not give anything away for the next phase of Marvel. This Marvel film, for example, has no extra scenes that still appear in the film during or after the credits. In this way, when the film is over and the lights in the room turn on again, you can actually leave the room. The only reason to remain seated during the credits is if you may want to know the names of people who have worked on certain things in the film.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The atmosphere and tempo of Endgame are also different compared to Infinity War, because In Infinity War there were more action scenes and intense events that they managed to play at a relatively fast pace, but still had enough room for humorous moments. In Endgame they have a more dramatic atmosphere after losing to Thanos. The pace can also seem a bit slower, because they are mainly busy processing their loss at the beginning of the film, but also planning what they can do best now.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The effects in the film also look good and credible. This way they know how to convey or bring certain things in this film in fun and creative ways. They must have used a lot of CGI and a green screen for these effects, but this is hardly reflected in the film.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The acting work is also done well. Many actors and actresses can be seen in this film in their famous roles. Most of the remaining Avenger characters are also in different locations or in a different life status than we are used to. In this way, the actors who play these roles have also had the opportunity to present their known roles in a different way. In this film every hero gets his own personal moment to shine. They know for example Captain Marvel, who in her own film was not received equally positively by everyone, in a somewhat better way.",232,neg,neg,neg,neg,

"Several of the narrative problems that are present in Infinity War are not resolved or made worse by this remarkably lazy film. Of note, Thanos' ideology is both utterly incoherent and utterly alien to the Zeitgeist. The writers simply lacked the courage to make Thanos into the eugenicist that he so clearly should be. Without that edge to him he is a scene chewing comic book *villain* in the worse way. I simply did not care about the plot because the villain is a snidely whiplash joke. The film doubles down on the idiocy present in Infinity War as Thanos' end goal is just more so. This problem renders the film hollow, emotionally inert.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]That might have been overlooked if the film's overall structure wasn't, more or less, identical to Infinity War. Starting at about 30 minutes in the two films run remarkably in parallel with each other. The pieces are slightly jumbled and certain characters end up playing different beats but act to act, sequence to sequence, scene to scene the underlying scaffolding of the plot is the same. This would be better if the plotting wasn't redundant in the first place. Infinity War boiled down to 6 color coded chase scenes over MacGruffins. The same is true in Endgame but even more so. The plot device introduced to allow the team a fighting chance produces whole manners of plot contrivances, incoherence and murky what the heck is happening. There are 21 other films in the series and while I have seen every single one (some more than 3 times!) I simply don't have the convoluted metaphysics memorized. If you saw each film once in the theatre as they were released parts of this mess will confuse you.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]On that note the Infinity Stones are even more MacGruffins in this film as Endgame doesn't even bother to try to visualize their various powers. Infinity War turned magick users into mere boxers and this film continues to lower the bar for imaginative use of space magick. I still don't understand what the difference between, say, the space stone and reality stone is practically. There is nothing in the film that demonstrates their powers. This adds to the rote laziness that the film embodies.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Inevitably in a film like this a few characters will get short changed. This happened here to my favorite character. For a film that so copied its predecessor's structure I am gobsmacked that not all re-matches occurred in the action scenes. Some of them do, but a pretty obvious and possibly entertaining one doesn't. On top of that the final moment-key to a character and the plot- is overly telegraphed due to the extraordinary amount of time spent with said character and the seeming checklist they have for a farewell tour. The balance is wrong for the character relationships. You can more or less guess the consequences based on screen time.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]None of the consequences of the two films seem final, abet textually a few of them are (I guess).

"DISCLAIMER- This is a spoiler FREE review[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Well, here we are.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]After 11 year's of top quality entertainment and planning that started all the way back with 2008's surprise smash hit Iron Man (do you feel old yet? I sure do), this part of Marvel's world domination comes to an end with what's likely to be one of, if not the biggest film's of all time, The Avengers: Endgame.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]It's a somewhat odd, occasionally emotional and fitting experience sitting back and concluding this part of the Marvel universe and while we know there's countless more Marvel film's coming our way, Endgame really does feel like the culmination of year's of hard work and adventures, that while not perfect, feels like a fitting tribute to what's come before and what still lays ahead.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]It's incredibly hard to talk about Endgame in depth without ruining the narrative the Russo brother's and their team have created but suffice to say the creative minds behind the scenes have given us another top quality piece of blockbuster filmmaking, that's likely to please diehard fans and more casual cinemagoers alike, the only problem is, when compared to it's genuinely surprising and perfectly paced predecessor, Endgame does feel slightly more formulaic and long in the tooth.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]It's picky for sure, but Infinity War gave us a Marvel experience that was unexpected, hilarious, emotional and epic and while Endgame has this in parts, it's not as all encompassing as last year's experience, even if by the rulebook, this was never going to be the case when tying up so many loose ends and finalising so much of what has come before it over the year's.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]A lot of these endings and plot tie ups will please those that have invested so much into a series that has been operating on an extremely high level for a number of year's, it's just that Marvel almost outdid themselves in Infinity War, making the more by the numbers plot threads and leaps of logic found in Endgame more highlighted than usual.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The other minor nitpick with the film is Endgames much talked about epic 3 hour runtime and while the film starts with some unexpected and emotionally charged instances, there's a clear late beginning and middle section of the film that at times drags and cover's similar ground one too many times, even if by relative terms, the runtime in the Russo's film never is too detrimental to the fun to be had.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]This fun comes in many forms, with particular highlights being Thor's new found lifestyle, the Hulk's more prominent role and Captain Marvel's addition to the Avengers family, while the films big action scenes (that must be said aren't that abundant) are a sight to behold, with Marvel once more showing off their ability to handle spectacles as good as, if not better than, everyone else.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]At the end of the day, it's been an incredible period for Marvel, with arguably no outright failures and an abundance of big winners, we've been spoilt for 11 straight year's and while Endgame may not be the best of the best, it's still a mighty fine and emotionally charged finale that does the beloved cinematic universe proud.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Final Say -[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]While not as surprising or even as Infinty War, Endgame is still a top quality and fitting end to so much good work that's come before it and while it's sad to say goodbye to this particular era, it's exciting to see what lays in store for Marvel moving ahead.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]4 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches out of 5",256,pos,pos,pos,neg,XXXXXX

Thor is, as always, well played and funny. Hulk is pretty decent and that's about it. Story is not interesting at all. Too many pointless dialogues that go on and on with no message whatsoever. The main idea behind the movie seems to be to let the guys do something, pack as many faces on screen as we can and, as long as there are explosions and some colorful CGI, it will be fine.

Now it has dawned on me that disney and the writers of this flick had nothing but cash in mind when planning these. The first Avengers was amazing, i believed that age of ultron was the forerunner for something epic with Thanos then these 2 movies were just a massive let down but it's all about cash and I took the bait. Hook, line and sinker. A final movie is supposed to give all the answers but this just gave me so many questions and left me confused and wondering whether I loved or hated it. Now it has sunk in and I gave it thoght i just hate it. Too many contradictions. Don't get me wrong.

One would think that the Russo Brothers would give us a movie filled with Sadness and Revenge, but that's not the case here. Thor still gives us strength and humor.

Dr. Banner/Hulk is still a mystery however Black Widow gives us a little vulnerability.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Where does Captain Marvel fit, and will they ever find the other Avengers all those questions get answered?[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Some things to be aware of, the first half of the movie takes a slower pace.

I'll not go very much into details because it is just a day old in the theatres here in India. The movie though was actually a bit comical in the beginning and towards the middle. Seriousness started to rise towards the end, with the last 30 or so minutes being the best, best, best part of the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. People who have seen the movie might agree that some of the main characters were given less screentime. Not comparing to anyone but some appreciable characters had less screentime. But what matters more is how well they did their part in those minutes. In the end they all are heroes! One disappointment though was the lack of credit scenes. Every fan was expecting a glimpse of the next phase of the Superhero Universe. Nonetheless it is a great movie. A worthy one. Everyone should watch it once. *I have an opinion though. There were numerous fan theories about the movie. I think Marvel Studios should atleast make an animated series of the good ones.",296,pos,pos,pos,pos,

No Avenger is left unbroken by the devastation that ensued when Thanos snapped his fingers and half the world turned to dust. The movie jumps ahead five years after that moment, with our superheroes are empty shells forced to reflect on their failures. Iron Man has retreated into the family life with wife Pepper Potts. Thor has lost his home on Asgard. Hulk has learned to subdue his baser instincts. And Black Widow wonders if any sense can be made of it all. That's when Ant-Man shows up, fresh from the Quantum Realm. It is willing and able to make its own, with Back to the Future coming in for a serious scene.

We all can't get what we want from the ending (for example GoT finale) but for Endgame this wasn't the ending we need but the one we deserve. Every character got enough screen time, expect for Captain Marvel who was hyped for much more, but for sure she had important role and Brie Larson performance before she even knew how her character should do is truly what deserves round of applause. Hulk and Thor characters recieved some backflash from fans but I am very happy to see comic adaptationa of Professor Hulk and King Thor personas. Robert Downey Jr. delivered best performance of his career. There were deep scenes, scenes that left me crying out loud in the cinema, laughing out loud etc. Comedy and tragedy were very well combined and in balance - as all thing should be. Also there were some minor moments that set up the Phase 4 for MCU. Fan service was enjoyable. CGI was amazing and final battle was deserving to be compared to th LotR battle scenes. Plot was amazingly well adjusted, some fans didn't like time travel definition i believe because they didn't understand it, but it is not very hard to understand just pay attention.

"If a couple you know, having lived together for eleven years, decide to hold a huge wedding, spare no expense, and invite everyone they know, the net effect would be a lot like Avengers Endgame: several hours of your life you feel you'll never get back, and the one thing everyone agrees on is, thank god it's over. I write this as someone who was a Marvel fan for a few years in the sixties, when these characters appeared only on the printed page. Then I forgot about the characters for thirty years, and came back to them when I had kids and we watched Marvel shows together: first the 1990s animated series, then the films beginning with the first X-Men in 2000. From those first films, the Marvel franchise has been in the hands of skilled writers and directors who take the art seriously - very seriously. The current MCU, however, starting with 2008's Iron Man, peaked after a few years with the first two Captain America films, and 2012's The Avengers. After that, the seeming need to expand the universe led to increasingly messier films, making superstars out of all of its lead actors while squeezing them into less and less screen time; bit players in their own movies. Last year's Avengers: Infinity War, merging all existing Avengers with the intergalactic storylines of the Guardians of the Galaxy was bad enough, but Endgame outdoes it in terms of taking a modestly priced and scaled, mildly subversive art form (the comic book) and turning it into an extravagantly budgeted, exhausting mess (the Hollywood blockbuster). The result is that although the climax of Endgame, bringing in almost every character who's appeared in the films since 2008, is pitched for thrills, the effect is the opposite. The return of all the heroes who disintegrated at the end of Infinity War is supposed to make us cheer, but it's as tiresome as the last drunken dinner speech at the aforementioned wedding. ""Really? I was hoping I could go home. Can't anyone shut him up?"" The skills that go into these films are undeniable, but there seems to be a tipping point past which plotting this many characters becomes a matter of chance and luck. As the films grow from one super-hero against one-supervillain (Iron Man; Captain America the First Avenger) to two or three super-heroes against a larger force (Iron Man II; Captain America the Winter Soldier) to a veritable platoon of super-heroes against armies of robots/aliens/bad guys, the limits are passed. Even an expert like Joss Whedon couldn't stop Avengers: Age of Ultron from running out of steam like a badly timed fireworks display. Nevertheless, partly through their quality casts, the appeal of the films grows: like a dry spell in the episodes of a soap opera, the audiences keep watching because they've bonded with the characters and will stick with them, hoping that eventually the relationship will get better. But a soap opera ain't the opera, and Endgame suffers from the blockbuster syndrome of giving the viewer too much of everything and not enough of anything. ""Angry and wanting more"" I think Pauline Kael called the Hollywood blockbuster, but in the case of Avengers: Endgame we can amend this to ""angry and wanting less.""",316,pos,pos,pos,pos,
"Not perfect. This is a long movie and some parts of it made me feel tired. This is unescapable in a movie this long. Some really big plotholes happened in movie that totally disturb me although pretty sure many people didnt care. In the end some scenes were really emotional, main focus was the original Avengers(which is what should happened in Infinity War too). Movie had lots of great moments and a perfect ending. But all the greatness and epic feel is due to this being the last avengers movie and it gets 8 point because of that. Plot itself wasnt that incredible to give it a 9. But you wouldnt question a person if he told you that the final battle of the movie is the best battle cinema history. They really delivered there.",317,pos,pos,pos,pos,

"Let's be honest since the first glance at the sprout of the MCU in the form of Iron Man we knew that it would be one of the finest additions to the garden of cinematography. And through the span of time vines, stems and buds just kept pleasing the eye, there were some deviations but the wild growth just kept on bringing the bean stalk to the castle up in the skies.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]However, as soon as you start something like the Avengers initiative you doom yourself to a big finale, especially after mind-bending preparation provided by Infinity War. The abundance of trailers and peeks heated the desire to watch like a blowtorch a pot of crÃ¨me, to the point that it almost turned to ashes.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]It takes a master to wrap up the story like this and that will take a lot of time - which it did - 3 hours of what I expected to be the greatest part, a beautiful blossom of Marvel. Going straight to the point, there were moments when I was looking at the wristwatch thinking that those hours are up, but the show just went on. The feeling of stretching never left, it was just numbed by some exquisite moments.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I would say that the story continued the past well, but the insertions of jokes and puns, especially pop culture felt off and showed a real cheap price. I admire the fun style of Marvel but in the end it seemed holding together like a craft of a 6 year-old child learning how to glue things together.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The major problem was that there were too many things to finalize and too many loose ends to tie. And then the creators opened the door that has left more questions that it should have, giving me disappointment that was gradually covered with fascination along the way. Spoilers aside, you shall know that without remembering previous parts you might miss the opportunity of total geek freak-out.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Finally, a point on the action, which is another hallmark of Marvel: Endgame has put the boot on all the sense and pushed on the visuals, scale and content itself. You just look from side to side, saying your wows, not even understanding what's happening and then come the moments for which you were hoping all time long, the ones that make you cheer and be genuinely happy for the characters.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Trying to keep up with the weight of the moment, I would say that in the end my expectations were not fulfilled to the full extent. Sure, I've spent a hilarious time, I've had tears in my eyes, I've almost peed my pants from excitement but the amount of good stuff has been lost in those three hours. Maybe it was because the high standards put in place by the Infinity War, or the pressure of the occasion, but I believe there is no excuse for ending the entire era like this. It is worth watching with friends to discuss and enjoy the ride but checking it out for the second time is not the thing that I would pick sober.",322,pos,pos,pos,pos,

"I'll try to avoid many in the way of spoilers here. The movie stands well enough on its own two feet. It is a long movie, but about half of it tells its own story in and of itself, picking up where Avengers Infinity War (2018) cliff hanger left off, the other half saluting the franchise in a hat tip that I think is about as fitting a farewell as any you will find in cinema these days. Social engineering agendas aside, I will credit the makers this much: classy![?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]If you have not followed the franchise for any length of time, never mind from the opening Incredible Hulk and Iron Man installments, there are a plethora of hat tips, teasers you might say, to whet your appetite.

Those moments will probably mean more to you, however, if you have followed the franchise.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]There are a handful of story arcs they could probably develop more, Spider-Man, for instance, perhaps even Capt. Mar-vel. But as franchises go, this was a strong ending to a fairly well stitched together set of interwoven story lines. You will not find any post-credits scenes here. I find it a little bittersweet, but like I said, those hat tips, in-credits acknowledgements, are the post-credits scenes, I think. More salutations for the folks who helped make it such a great franchise.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Now if only much of the work generated by the franchise went to U.S. citizenry, but we will not go there for purposes of this review.",324,pos,pos,pos,pos,

"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. I enjoyed it more than any other MCU movie I have ever watched, or any other ""superhero movie"" I have ever watched (and boy I have watched A LOT of those). If I could describe the movie in a few words I woul just have to say ""the good, the bad and the ugly"", and the reason for that is because throughout this masterpiece you get to see it all, and when I say all, i mean absolutely everything you could expect from all the MCU movies and so much more. We get to see our hero's win, lose and do things you will never expect. The only reason I didn't give this 10 stars is because although the movie is as good as it can possibly get, it has some little problems and tiny little plot holes that add up together to take one star down. Some things don't make total sense, but I guess if a talking racoon/rabbit is ok then I am fine. The one thing that I love about the movie is how simple yet complex and surprising it is. The main storyline is exactly what you would expect, but some how the movie still manages be so interesting and unexpected, and guys I didn't even talk about the final third of the movie which is the best thing I have ever seen on a movie screen in my life. In conclusion, this movie is fantastic. Go see it now! But before you do you need to understand three main things. One. It is freaking three hours! Go to the bathroom before! Two, it is connected to all of the other MCU films, so before you watch this make sure to watch the rest of them before. This way you will not only understand endgame better, but the entire MCU better. And three. It is very complex.

"After waiting for a year, Avengers: Endgame hit the theatres and shattered a number of box office records worldwide. But, was it really so perfectly great? No.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Good : The first thing I loved about this movie was that it was the most character driven film in the MCU till date. In particular, Hawkeye and Black Widow got the most of character shine. And, it didn't have much of Captain Marvel. As someone who feels awkward when she comes on screen, it was a good thing. It did a great job of serving the fans. So many crowd pleasing moments! I was literally jumping and whistling when I was watching this film, literally. The third act is full of those moments. Those moments do come along with really good character background, a story and excitement. All of these do not make complete sense, but at least they weren't blant. And, many parts are quite nostalgic. It has tried it's best to give every character a proper arc. Performances are incredible. I didn't even hate Don Cheadle in this movie. On the whole, it was insanely entertaining and has ridiculous amount of great moments to say the least.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Mixed : It's not a spoiler to say it's a time travel film. While this plot device served a lot to give us a lot of crowd pleasing moments, each of which I really loved, the whole time travel part could've been even more epic and exciting than it was. There were parts in Infinity War where it jumped from plotline to plotline. This one does the same, but it looked more choppy here. Not necessarily a bad thing, a movie of this scale would have such problems. But it was a bit more distracting than before. I admit I liked many arcs given to the characters. But, they were still a bit illogical, in particular that of Steve Rogers. Many things were entertaining as hell, but still quite paradoxical.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Bad : It's a time travel movie. It generates a lot many plot holes and inconsistencies. It uses time travel as an excuse for getting certain things done. It has the most generic issues of a non sci-fi time travel movie. The timeline surely is messed up now. I don't know how the time travel in this universe works and how certain things were amended due to all of these time travelling stuffs. May be I will never know. And Thanos. He was treated more like a mustache twirling villain, rather than how he was in Infinity War. The way his character ended was the most disappointing part of the movie. It feels as if it tries to be as big as Infinity War while it clearly isn't.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Conclusion : You can and must watch this film. It's a film by the Russo Brothers, you can definitely count on them for an entertaining film, but this is perhaps their weakest film in the MCU. It isn't well paced as Infinity War is, but still gives all the moments you can wish for. Infinity War is a whole lot better than this film, but is still a worth watching flick. If you stop thinking about the inconsistencies time travel creates in this film, this will be a much better experience.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Rating.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Score : 8.9/10[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Grade : A",328,pos,pos,pos,pos,

Please keep in mind that this is mostly my opinion.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]From the end of 'Avengers: Infinity War' I have felt as though the story was incomplete, as though the movie ended before the climax. But I guess that was the point. Because Endgame is the climax, the finale, the ultimate conclusion.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The opening few minutes were ingenious for building on the concept of how impactful Thanos' actions were.

But I suppose with the Infinity Gauntlet about, there's no telling what will happen, which kills the sense of wonder in this Marvel universe. Besides these 20 minutes, I was not that impressed by the remaining first half of the movie, but boy, did the last half pay off!

Wrong. There's a few didn't see that coming moments - - even for me, ""Mr. I Knew That Was Going To Happen."" 3 or 4 times I got goosebumps. Although truth be told I get those just from the theme music. If they make a 4 hour super fan director's cut I'm all in. 9.5 out of 10 for me. This one has overtaken Capt.

"This movie is just straight fan service in my opinion, it's a fantastic payoff to the 11 years of the MCU. I think it's probably one of the best endings we could have gotten. But, there are many flaws, like the CGI. It has very good effects but it has way to much. About half of the movie is on a green screen. And I'm not exaggerating, it's definitely the most effects heavy movie in the MCU. That's just my opinion though. The acting is actually a lot better than I thought it would be and that sounds quite bad, but I was really impressed with some of the performances. Particularly from Chris Evans and Jeremy Renner. A lot more depth compared to previous movies. RDJ is great as usual but I still think his best performance is in Iron Man (2008), doesn't mean it's disappointing, just in my opinion is outshines by other strong performances. I think the length of the movie is actually good as it's never really boring or slow. I think it's probably the second best superhero movie this year, because I think Joker is amazing. But it's still a very good movie but if I was to be honest, probably a little over-hyped, I think it's because it's a fan service movie and I don't consider myself an ""MCU fanboy"", but that view can very much change depending on the viewer. But yeh, really good.",366,pos,pos,pos,pos,

"The best movie I've ever seen, truly extraordinary film making. I'm late arriving into the MCU, theres still half a dozen movies I haven't seen. I'm also no Marvel aficionado.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Who cares? Comic book movies are supposed to be ridiculous, other-worldly, full of people with absurd abilities competing against each other. It shouldn't be this loaded with character development. Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Romanov, Ant-Man, Banner, Pepper Potts, Nebula, Hawk-Eye.....all the survivors from Infinity War have a completely unique burden to being a survivor of Thanos' 'snap'. But more than that, this one movie acts as a denouement to 21 other movies and a mass of individual storylines. In Ultron, it was a big surprise to learn that Barton is massively family-focused, but now we know that, it's no surprise whatsoever how he responds to mass extinction, basically carrying out an individualised purge against all that should have turned to dust and didn't.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]You can comfortably know nothing about these characters, and still be a blubbering wreck. End Game is also perfectly balanced, without doubt the darkest movie in the franchise, but also the funniest. The Russo's clearly recognising that without some comic relief, the characters themselves would be overcome by anger and grief, thwarting their quest to reverse the snap.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]It's an absolute fanboys dream, bringing back to many characters that we thought were long gone.

"Either you are a Marvel fan or not, or maybe you are a Marvel hater (because probably you're a fan of another. Aye, that one), I highly recommend you to see this film.

I thought they would divide it into 50:50, but, I can tell you that Endgame is just a quarter of it. Legendary scenes and people everywhere. The most amazing and mesmerizing CGI works will appear in approximately the last 30 minutes; aye, that important scene. Epic scenes: checked. Surprising scenes: checked. Funny scenes: definitely checked. Warm-hearted scenes: checked multiple times.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I don't think the scoring has a big impact on helping to build a sad feeling; I'm not even crying. But, somehow, the Avengers' theme song sounds more glorious and that makes me feel empty, like, they're saying goodbye in the coolest way they can. So I can say, this film won't amaze your eyes like before. Your heart is their target: building an empty feeling as they walked out of the screen.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Can't say more.

"Avengers: Endgame:- A year after half the characters disappeared, we created our own endless theories and possibilities of killing Thanos. Nothing said so far, the movie turns out to be a good explanation as to how situations could change in just maybe a single possible way. This doesn't mean that the script made predictable. Well, some of it is, but the Russo brothers manages to engage the audience with awe and curiosity. This is a 3 hour long movie which has tons of emotional and heart warming scenes where the characters beautifully express their softness. Also the thought expressed while scripting these scenes is quite admirable. At some points the scenes are a little bit dragged but that's just for the viewers to enjoy their favorite character in this final project. The concepts do contradict at times and can get a little confusing. The concepts cannot be elaborated as they can be a major spoiler. A few moments in the movie were just breathtakingly awesome as it was totally unexpected. The actors have delivered their best performance in all aspects by connecting to it's viewers throughout. The MCU couldn't get a better ending to justify the events in this movie which makes it just spectacular. Experiencing and reliving what we have witnessed till today in all the Marvel movies was the main objective of the makers and they did a commendable work. It's not quite comparable, but if done in terms of entertainment, then yes, infinity war is ahead of all in this game.

Endgame is funny, emotional and provides more depth to main character heroes. However, leaves so many important things out of focus despite its 3 hour runtime.

"Considered as the Finale or the final chapters of the Avenger Series, it is the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is the only film of this century that has garnered such a Huge demand in domestic as well as International Markets. Fans, especially the kids and teenagers are awaiting its release with baited breathe and fortunately I was able to watch the movie couple of days earlier than the International Release.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The Movie is 3 hours long but believe me it is too short to cover such as vast ensemble cast and package all their stories into it within the stipulated time. I believe that the movie should have been made into two parts. Why I feel this way? Let me explain it to you. There are certain parts of the movie where you feel they are trying to build up the story and later you realize that they just dragged it and there are other scenes in the movie where you feel it is being done hastily before we the audience could sink in the gravity of the scene or the moments resulting the emotional scenes as bland. Now why would they even consider building up the story as Avengers Infinity Wars had already set the stage for the Finale? Everyone who has watched the prequel to Endgame only wants to know how these Heroes will make things right and how emotionally they have been affected.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]If they had made it in two parts then every character would have shined like in Infinity War but here even the main characters fail to make an impact. There are jokes here and there but they aren't enough. There are too many unnecessary, silly scenes that only consume time and nothing else. I believe after watching the Endgame, every fan will agree that Infinity Wars is the best movie of the Franchise. If you recall Captain America - Civilian War then it reminds you of the brilliant action choreography because most of it is done in the daylight as against the dark creepy VFX settings like most of the other Superhero flicks. Even the Infinity War triumphs in the Grand Battle because everything was done in daylight. Those scenes looks real compared to the dark graphics. I was Very disappointed with the Finale 8 -10 mins of Grand Battle of Endgame, it was similar to Aquaman.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]My opinion may sound bit negative but its not, you will definitely enjoy the movie and there are some good moments including is a moment where you may get heartbroken, I mean literally if you are a Marvel Fan.

Anyone giving this film a high rating suffers from Marvel Bias Syndrome.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I thought the previous installment was bad. This installment lowered the bar even further. Writers are so busy pushing their man-hating agenda by making the two most powerful Avengers (Thor and Hulk) buffoons, they failed to capture the essence of the Avengers.

The movie takes time to show us the unbearable loss of Infinity War and how the Avengers each deal with it, before a way to bring back all of the victims of the Snap appears.

From then on, this is a completely different movie and it wonderfully concludes so many of the arcs from the past 11 years. The whole cast give an excellent performance with particular highlights being Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant Man.

I was extremely disappointed with how these characters were treated, because they deserved so much better than Endgame. Instead of resolving their character arcs in a satisfying and sensical way, the Russos decided to go for meaningless shock value and ""fanservice"" that only makes sense to them (and not the majority of fandom).

The gates opened in many times to have a great breaking of relationships and massive character development, but the Russo's instead took those opportunities to make action sequences rather than anything that the audience would feel for more than 3 minutes afterward, a mere portion of an over three hour movie.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Also, another point to note, there is a portion of a scene which scream ""women's equality"" at the viewer in the most cheesiest and cliche way which completely breaks whatever connection the viewer is currently having with the rest of the scene. The proper way to handle equality of women in movies is to just make them cool, and not overdo it to the extreme this movie demonstrated.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]If your a fan of the MCU, definitely watch it.

"I think film is entering a post-cliche phase, where tired tropes are no longer tired, but are now just accepted tools in a storyteller's toolbox. Certainly we don't need to enforce originality on all forms of art. I adore this film. The entire MCU is a breathtaking opera, and this is the ten-year grand finale. You *do* need to see all twenty-one previous films (in chronological order, hopefully, rather than release order) because taken on its own, ""Endgame"" would be a mishmash, with so many of its call-backs missed.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I think film is also leaving the era of the auteur, and entering that of the committee. George Lucas may have been the final straw, as when Disney (the originators of the committee method, from what I can tell) picked up the mantle of that particular franchise, their natural choice to revert to committee decisions dovetailed with everyone's need to get franchises out of one person's control. The MCU was planned out ten years in advance, so that almost at once -- and certainly by Ultron -- ""Endgame"" was being envisioned. Seeing how all the disparate threads meet and find either their resolution or their own inspiring arc, that *in itself* is amazing. Knowing that, in the most crucial moment of the film, we get a familiar call-back to a much earlier part of the MCU, elevates the experience from one of possible bewilderment to outright joy. It's no wonder that other directors would defer this type of blockbuster to the Russos. I only wonder how anyone involved in the creative process could have kept these secrets to themselves for ten years. Knowing that this film makes its predecessor seem like a prelude, and all the other significant milestones in the franchise series seem like blips on a radar, it must have been nerve-wracking to know how all of this turns out and still feed us those ""massive"" revelations in the earlier films.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]When in the right context, a superlative experience.

"I admit I had fairly high expectations for this movie, but in this instance I find it justified given the buildup to this particular movie.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]To put it shortly, it is inferior to Infinity War in every way. I've seen infinity war probably 8 times now and Endgame makes me appreciate it even more. The pacing and execution of Infinity War is incredible in comparison. Infinity war felt like a much more mature movie in that there are moments that still make me feel sadness for the characters and the pacing of the movie was far better. Endgame felt all over the place. There were moments I wanted to tear up but the scenes didn't feel adequate to really draw a reaction. They moved on far too quickly and the movie itself was choppy. It was hard to really relate to the characters. When I first saw Infinity War I wondered how they would handle so many characters in one film and be able to still have the audience empathize with them, but any doubts were laid to rest. This movie is pretty much the worst case scenario for how to handle many characters.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Don't get me wrong, there were parts that were quite satisfying, which is hard to go into further detail about without divulging too much information.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]All in all this movie was saved by particular scenes and those few moments of feeling resolution. It felt more childish in execution and appeal and Infinity War felt more mature than the typical Marvel movie. When I saw Captain Marvel I really disliked it, but I thought it was a one off and they would be redeemed with Endgame.

"Here is my spoiler free review, I often like to discuss the negatives of a movie before the positives so here goes.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I didn't quite enjoy Endgame as much the first time around since I had been spoiled about significant events in the film and it does suffer from quite a few plot holes. Some events aren't explained quite enough and require a good bit of mental gymnastics to hurdle. My main complaint like many others, despite not having much screen time, is Brie Larson (more on that later). Captain Marvel's movie, of which I do share the popular dislike for, was released barely over a month before Endgame. This is important because she is quite arrogant and emotionless in Endgame, a popular argument being Tony Stark is quite arrogant also, however we have had over a decade and 10 movies to watch and understand Stark's backstory and why he is this way, Captain Marvel not so much. I do however give Brie Larson the benefit of the doubt, after seeing how she is in interviews and such, I do believe the blame here lies with the directors. Larson and Marvel seem like completely different people. Her appearance is downgraded later in the movie too. There's also a scene with Fortnite.. which of course speaks for itself.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]All of the above is why I simply cannot give it a 10, one may think how can so many negatives only deduct 1 from a perfect score? Well, staying true to a spoiler free review that is quite the task to explain of course.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]As with any avid fan like myself and having watched Iron Man in cinemas 11 years ago, here we are 22 movies later and there isn't much more I could've asked for. Lot's of previous questions answered, closure brought to many story-lines, many epic moments and surprises. Had the franchise not been so long until this point, my rating most likely would've been 7.5. Somebody that has watched all previous instalments will appreciate Endgames nods at it's predecessors, lots of rewards for longtime fans. Is it as good as Infinity War? Not quite, it does shortly follow however, up there with my favourites IW, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man. A must watch for any Marvel fan. There are however still unanswered questions as with any MCU movie, which will most likely be answered in the upcoming titles.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]TLDR: Slightly political, plot holes and an undesirable character that ultimately get's trumped by the excellence of the other 95%",493,pos,neg,neg,neg,XXXXXX

"So to begin with, if I give a score of 2.5 it doesn't mean that I didn't like it but that I'm undecided enough about this film... it's not bad or excellent for all that, but I would say that I still wonder... right away I preferred the previous Infinity War because there was no subtlety in the story... Here we have for 3 hours of film 3 distinct time stages that I will let you discover for yourself. At the end of the session I said to myself that the end of Infinity War was already a beautiful conclusion and for me we didn't need a sequel... because I felt that the film was not necessarily necessary and useful... I won't spoil the 3 temporal stages of the film but if I think that the very first hour is for me the conclusion of Infinity War and well it was sufficient... the heroes question themselves and each one wants to live their life in peace... why go further? you would tell me but it's the cinema and the taste of adventure so let's go and shake up the laws of nature;... why not... I'm not against it but still need the 2nd temporal stage of the film to hold its own and its part a little in all directions and so I say to myself.. how did they do it?... did I miss any steps? because they will see and see even a little too fast to realize their plan... a lot of inconsistency in this 2nd temporal step... and I confess to you that I was looking forward to seeing the 3rd and last step of the story... I like it a little better because I feel that the Russo brothers feel more comfortable when it comes to action-reaction... here I dive into it and as if by magic... more inconsistency everything works... ok I start to sink pleasantly into my seat and for the little anecdote I brought a little cushion.... because 3 hours of film is long and I didn't regret it.....) and Thor's Thunder Slap... a magnificent conclusion to the 11 years of Marvel Cinema Universe with CGIs worthy of the 2 billion box office receipts won on Inifinity War.. rather satisfied on this side because my eyes were on Thanos and feeling not knowing if he will win or not denotes a pretty good kinematic construction of this 3rd time step which is almost perfect... but... I don't understand why the Russo brothers chose this or that character to put value on End-Game... I can understand for one... but not for another... the characters play well because they play their final conclusion and I greet the actors who have put all their knowledge and potential... Robert Downey J.R, Scarlette Johansson, Chris Evans... and the beautiful Brie Larson whom I liked well here in her costume and in her appearances... well done my best... but for the others rather disappointed I almost didn't want to see them so much some shocked me visually.. I wouldn't say their names but when you see them you'll understand who I'm talking about... for me End-Game is not the end of Inifnity War was enough but overall the movie is good but doesn't excel in its choices, its manners and its script construction... Will it exceed Infinity War at the Box office? certainly that yes but not many except surprise..... the craze will be there but if some fans are satisfied with the conclusion just like me others are likely to be even more disappointed...

"I was super hyped for Avengers: Endgame after the fantastic Avengers: Infinity War last year. I always wondered ""How were they going to top it?"" so what was the result after sitting in a cinema for almost 3 hours? I came out a little underwhelmed, honestly. I must stress that I don't think Endgame is a bad movie by any means, it's just the bar set by Infinity War was so high for me that all the shortcomings and issues I had with Endgame made me feel like it was the weaker half of the story by quite a significant amount in comparison.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]One thing I really noticed in Endgame was the pacing and structure of the movie was all over the place. There were weird tangents in the story that didn't really go anywhere and were just used as a quick gag or fan service. Compared to Infinity War where everything flowed so smoothly, it felt to me Endgame's writing was quite sloppy in places. The jokes were not hitting quite as well, and characters were acting differently just for the sake of a contrived moment or joke to occur. Without spoiling anything, Thanos for example seems completely different in Endgame to what he was in Infinity War. There were just so many moments where characters were acting un-natural, that it was distracting.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]As for the characters and emotional moments, Captain Marvel honestly might as well never have been in this movie. She barely does anything. Iron Man and Captain America get the most screentime for a good reason and have nice conclusions. The Hulk feels toned down here alot and left to the sides. Thor is mostly comic relief here, so if you never found Thor: Ragnarok funny, you might hate him big time here. The others have shared screentime and you do see alot of characters in this movie. It does have a big finale feel to it, and there are many nice references to previous Marvel movies in there too. If you've seen Back to the Future: Part II, that's basically how the Time Travel stuff works. Just try not to think about it too much, otherwise the inconsistencies might annoy you.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Overall, I still had a blast with Avengers: Endgame. I was never bored despite the lengthy running time. However, the reason why I felt a little let down, despite still liking it, is that re-watching Infinity War just the night before was close to perfection at telling that side of the story. The sequence of events, the humour, the emotional beats, and the characters all acted at their very best in Infinity War. Endgame to me, felt like a noticeable drop in quality despite the grandness and scale of it acting as a swan song to the MCU Universe. I'm not sure where Marvel can go from here. They've pretty much done the most epic Comic Book Superhero movie storyline they could have ever done, so what's next?[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]7.5/10",562,pos,pos,neg,pos,

The writers for endgame were better off letting Thanos keep the stones and having the avengers deal with their losses for the first half of the movie. I would of love to see thanos get to utilize the different stones and their abilities, instead of having the movie turn into ""battle for the snap"". The cliche girl power moment towards the end of the film was also cringe, you already did that in infinity war so it doesn't have that same impact this time around. Also the confusion, if there are 3 different tesseract's for the sake of plot, does that mean there are three different thanos? does the snap only defeat that timelines thanos or does he still exist in other timelines?

"After 11 years and 22 films in the making, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become one of the ballsiest experiments ever taken in cinematic history, and one that has captured entire generations. Perhaps the most anticipated blockbuster since Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Avengers: Endgame marks the culmination of the first 3 phases of this forever running series, wrapping up multiple storylines and character arcs in the process.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]After the shocking and devastating events of 2018's Infinity War, the original Avengers are left stranded on Earth with no clear path of their futures. The mad titan Thanos wiped out 50% of the population and the world has become something of an apocalyptic wasteland. They can either move forward and live different lives or find a way to bring back what was once present.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The second of a two-part finale is shaped over a 3 hour and 1-minute runtime, and the result is a roller coaster ride unlike anything Marvel has ever done before. If Infinity War was the ultimate fan film, Endgame is a different beast. Its predecessor was an ensemble piece, a simple good-vs-evil plot populated with multiple characters while blending humour and character motivations to spectacular effect. This is more like an old fashioned epic, channelling ambition, scope, and storytelling as dense as films from Lawrence of Arabia to The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Screenwriters Christopher Marcus and Stephen McFeely and directors Joe and Anthony Russo work hard to focus on the right elements of the storyline, without disastrously going off the rails. The script is mostly absorbed with the past, creating not just a sense of nostalgia and poignancy, but overall a unique viewpoint on the past 22 films. It makes you realise how far these characters have come, which feels satisfying. Even if the action and special effects are, for the most part, impressive, the film's strong point is the character focus, which was the perfect direction to take.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]There are a few stumbles along the way. The pacing can be bumpy across 3 hours, especially when expositional scenes frequently overstay their welcome. You cannot help but feel overwhelmed at times due to the overstuffed amount of story, which can make action scenes feel less satisfying than they should. But for a finale as monumental as this film, not everything can work. There are more stories to tell, but there is no doubt that anything following on will come close to matching the brilliance of Endgame.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Finally, this is a Marvel film that demands repeated viewings. Mark my words!",593,pos,pos,pos,pos,
"***No Spoilers*** Epic doesn't begin to describe the absolute amazing experience this movie was. A journey to infinity stones and beyond!!! Loved the movie.

"The biggest minus is, the movie is rushed up. Way too many things to solve and conclude even in this marathon of three hours. Some lost battle opportunities between some characters, plot holes, lazy writing and not enough explained things. But you cannot explain everything and please everybody in a superhero movie. Maybe a trilogy of 7 hours in total, instead of two movies of 5.40 cumulated would have been better. Anyway. The movie is not bad. It has some good performances, especially RDJ's one, it is emotional, it has totally unexpected turns and of course the pretty CGI. It is worth the wait and worth seeing it in cinema 3D. But don't you dare drink something before, or until the last half hour. 3h long, remember?",595,pos,pos,pos,pos,
"This movie is honestly the Empire Strikes Back of Marvel. A lot of movies aren't nearly as good. Firstly, the CGI, the action, and just the special effects on the heroes, they're top notch. Second, I know that this movie doesn't exactly have the action throughout because of the time travel plot, well there's a quite a bit of action scenes, but it gives us a enjoyable throwback to the old MCU movies and saves the big blockbuster action for the finale and there's nothing to be said of the finale except for one word: EPIC. Lastly, it really put a good use of the 11 year buildup of our heroes. And you really careabout all of them. And everyone does career-best performances. But the star of the show is RDJ. He's always been great as Tony Stark, but I don't think he was as good as he was in this movie. He honestly deserves an Oscar. And don't listen to haters of this movie please.

"Although I expected much more from this movie, it is still satisfying for me and a decent finale to the avengers series. The movie starts with showing you how the snap affected one of the heroes life. then followed by the remaining avengers trying to protect the remainig world by fighting crime normally as they were doing before Thanos's time. After losing all hope, Ant-man finally returns to the avengers and introduces an idea that might actually work, but one that he can't carry out himself. This leads to the reunion of the avengers team which will spark events that will change the MCU forever. The pacing of the events is not quiet thorough and some prolonged dramatic scenes fall apart and make you feel bored instead of sad. Also the most exciting and effective parts are all packed in the last hour. one of the technical aspects that I did not like was the blurry transition, the camera takes a long time to focus on a character or un-focus from a scene and move on to the next, which really hurt my eye in the IMAX theater. but overall, it was a nice experience and you shouldn't miss this one, infinity war is still the best MCU movie for me but endgame is among the greatest in the series.",609,neg,neg,neg,pos,XXXXXX

"This is it! This is ""THE FIGHT OF OUR LIVES!"" Of course, this was a film on my anticipation list. I didn't put it on the actual list because it was a given. I've been with this extensive universe for 10, going on 11, years. Going into the cinema, I was excited and worried, because I knew that this would be the end of an era and characters. Coming out I was exhausted in the best possible way. I, and the entire audience, were full of emotions both happy and sad. Now let's get into why. POSITIVES! After Infinity War, we were all coming back no matter what! The plot is obviously about reversing what had happened, but all of us are invested in this world, so obviously we were onboard with that. Without spoilers, the course the film takes is fantastic. Although it has a slow start, it was fantastic to slow down and deal with the impact of the Infinity War events and to see these incredible characters cope and to see how the actors performed. Everyone is great, as always. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic. Audiences get to see an impeccable performance from the man that started it all and he is in good company. The core Avenger characters/actors are all great. Where Renner and the writers take Hawkeye is epic. Chris Evans is awesome as Cap and Johansson shines bigtime in the film. Although Josh Brolin's Thanos' appearance is limited, audiences have Infinity War to understand the character! Anthony and Joe Russo return with a punch. Taking risks in the story and action. AND THE ACTION! The final action sequence is easily my favourite action sequence among the MCU movies! The Russo Bros have an incredible ability, that they utilized in The Winter Soldier, where they showcase a character in a small role but make them large. This is what they used in Infinity War and Endgame and that made them perfect to helm to two-parter finale. The Russo Bros also had two shots that made me super emotional. The first is the final shot and it's a tear jerker from an emotional standpoint. And the other occurs as the film wraps up and it showcases how far the MCU has come. They also cameoed more of the Community cast which was hilarious! The entire film flows incredibly well and doesn't at all feel like a 3 Hour epic. This is a praise to the editors of the film, never once making the audience bored in the way they formed the narrative. The visual effects are stunning. In Infinity War I had a problem with the digital image mixed with the live action, but not here. Everything is seamless. From the digital characters to the action. It has got a lot of beautiful and familiar artwork and sets that all blend well together. The costumes are fantastic. Iron Man's and Cap's costumes were fantastic adaptations of the source material. But then again, there were other updated costumes and makeup that were welcomed upgrades. Alan Silvestri's score is used to perfection in the most epic moments! There is so much that I enjoyed and loved, but I love the fact that there are two things that occur in the third act that I have been awaiting for such a long time and the fact that they used both in the epic action sequence was the best thing to occur onscreen for such a long time! NEGATIVES! The problems I have with the film are minor and don't impact my opinion significantly. Most of these are to do with the writing. Like I said before, the film has a slow first act. Once we get past that the film picks up, but it's still there. Again, without spoiling the movie, the film deals with a certain plot device and being a huge fan of that certain device, after the movie finished, I started to deconstruct it and not a lot of it works. But that's nit-picking. The humour between characters works very well, but the humour for the audience not so much. The film takes itself seriously, and that is awesome! It's just that the humour and comedic elements are weak. Thor is awesome in the final act but before then he is used as comedic relief with how the character is displayed and portrayed, and it feels forced and unwarranted. It's unfortunate because Hemsworth was so hilarious in Thor: Ragnarok and those comedic elements flowed well into Infinity War, but not here. And lastly, this is an issue not to do with the movie but the audience. There is a lot of references and cameos to past MCU films, like a lot. And whilst this is fantastic and helps wrap up storylines and character arcs, there will be audience members that don't appreciate the references because they hadn't seen the MCU movies/franchises being referenced. Example; someone that watches The Avengers franchise but doesn't watch the Guardians of the Galaxy movies may not understand certain scenes. Not the Guardians in particular, just an example. CONCLUSION! So, Avengers: Endgame satisfies the biggest MCU fans and Marvel Comics fans with its interpretation of story and character. There are so many epic moments, along with the powerful and sad scenes that will cause a few tears due to a great script and fantastic acting. This isn't my absolute favourite MCU movie, but it's high on the list. It's the Endgame and the stories that the film wraps up are done in an appropriate and epic fashion.",611,pos,neg,pos,pos,

It boosted the hype, the anticipation to a new level! I was counting on the finale film to be the best I have ever seen in the MCU so far. But that dream, that wish of mine got shattered! Why? There are so many reasons behind it! Slow pace till the time travel sequences kicked up, lack of cohesiveness between the characters, not duly written script, lesser emotional impact ; all of these made the film less enjoyable for me. The only thing that saved it from being doomed for me is the Last 1 hour, the climax battle scenes are beautifully made. To have all the superheroes in one place and give proper screen times to everyone is a daunting task. They handled it pretty well!

The actors looked bored, and at times there was more green screen than the Star Wars prequels.

"Imagine you have to write Endgame. You would have to find a way to reconcile several things: the expectations of the audience, the continuity not only with the other movies, but with future projects and past comic book ideas, the actors that just won't come back whatever the reason, America's unhealthy obsession with political correctness, the wishes of the producers, the wishes of the director, the wishes of the people paying for the movie. It is an nearly impossible task. As a solution to this conundrum, Avengers: Endgame was really decent. It has character build up, exposition - maybe too much of it, foreshadowing, great action scenes, great emotional scenes, great acting. It got rid of all the leaving actors in a very nice way for their characters. It solved the problem of the death of so many living creatures in a way that didn't mean everything was simply undone or redone or forgotten.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]That being said, all the characters in this film are dumb. I mean, really dumb. They have lightning fast reactions, but their solutions are ridiculous. The whole concept of the solution, which I don't want to spoil, lends itself to improvement.; it was not spent in this story. Also, there is a key moment that ends (heh) it all... it could have been done minutes before. All the elements where already there. And there are so many logic holes in the plot that my mind just reels from thinking about it.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Bottom line: a very beautiful film for your heart.

"Eleven-year wait is finally over. The Endgame hit theatres on April 24th, and the word ""hit"" might be the best way to put it. The culmination of a comic-book phenomenon called ""The Avengers"" is set to become the most successful film in terms of box-office gross, as well as be generally regarded as the best comic-book movie ever made.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The story takes place in the so-called MCU, a universe where all the superheroes reside. Established 11 years ago with the release of the first film, The Iron Man, at that time tricky move has proven to be a resounding success and changed the lives of everyone involved. Marvel managed to build a universe so mesmerizing it has made fans always coming back for more. With the last film closing the chapter, it was Marvel's responsibility to do justice to this franchise. And it seems that they didn't disappoint.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The film plays on a sentimental note, leaving viewers with a nostalgic feeling. This is done by referencing to the past movies, and even revisiting the old sets. Slightly less action-packed than the former Infinity War, The Endgame focuses on the journey of the original Avengers, but still, or perhaps because of this, manages to take many surprising turns. It is nothing new that the stories of some of these characters are coming to an end, but don't make this prevent you from going to see this film! The death sequences are dealt with graciously, avoiding overused clichÃ©s. They leave you feeling heart-broken, but also satisfied with the epic conclusion.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The only think that I find to be irritating was the song repertoire. Although the songs usually fit the scenes in which they appeared, they didn't tie the story together, making it a little chaotic and inconsistent.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]All in all, The Endgame is an achievement in both, cinematography and storytelling, and is a must-see for every cinephile.",657,pos,neg,neg,neg,XXXXXX

No, the positive reviews here came from a devoted fan base that have watched 22 movies for over a decade and are emotionally connected to the characters and the storyline!

I really do suggest you do watch this movie if you are a fan of the MCU and not listen to these pretentious ""critics"" who only like art house indie films and hate on everything made by a studio! If you are a fan of the MCU and have followed along the span of 22 movies and love the characters then this movie will run you through the gamut of emotions! I have never seen a more interactive audience in my life. Laughs and cheers at all the right moments and dead silence in the emotional ones. Not a dry eye in the crowd when the lights came on and no one was embarrased because everyone was on the same journey whether you were 7 or 57. My opinion may be biased because I LOVE these movies but most posters on here are down right cynical and will try to find something wrong with anything!

I don't really have any issues with the film, at least those that are not spoilers anyway. If I had one non-spoiler issue with the film it would be fact that the first hour is a bit slow but afterwards it picks up and never stops. Really any complaints I have with this film is shut out by everything else. My complaints are just nitpicks. It fits its three hour runtime very well and provides a highly satisfying end to the 11 year saga that began with Iron Man in 2008.

Here's the honesty - I was wrong, you were wrong, we were wrong. Never before in the history of filmmaking have we seen 22 films crescendo in such a beautifully complex and wonderfully perfect way. Never. If you haven't seen them all, do that first, it's with it. If you just haven't seen Endgame yet GO but bring some tissues because it's going to hit you in some good and rough ways!

"So a handful of heroes fight all the way to the climactic end of the movie, and then they lose the chance to finish what they started. I am not going to spoil it, but watching a million CGI characters appear on both sides was like letting all the air out of the tires. All the dramatic build-up was lost when it became a billions against billions battle.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Which brings up the fact that at least 90 minutes of this movie is spent on boring scenes of various Avengers feeling depressed about the death of the heroes, and going to support group meetings. We get it. The Avengers are depressed. This could have been covered in fifteen minutes or less in a group meeting. We did not need to follow each Avenger through their depressing trip down memory lane. Thank God Ant Man came back from the quantum universe and got the ball rolling!![?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Unfortunately, Thor becomes the punchline for jokes throughout the movie. Since Captain Marvel is the new #1 hero, they had to power down Thor by turning him into a drunken hobo. The Incredible Hulk has spent the past three movies (Thor Ragnarok, Infinity War, & this one) in permanent erectile dysfunction, and he continues to be a zero in this movie. Thor and the Hulk are just here to be the focus of comedy as has-beens. Even Bruce Banner as a scientist gets slapped down. Michael Douglas and the Pym Particles have to fix what Bruce Banner fails to do. It is a very sad way for two of Marvel's earliest and most powerful heroes to end their game.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]There are a lot of good moments in Endgame. Most of them happen when the small crew of Avengers is trying to find the original gems. Then the battle when it is just the small group against Thanos is excellent. It was building up to a great ending, Captain America & Iron Man defeating Thanos, against all odds. Even Thor was redeeming himself in the battle! That is how this Marvel Comics masterpiece could have ended. But they had to throw in the billions of CGI characters and turn it into a big circus act... Too bad.

The movie as they announced before is completely different than the infinity war , it's the difference between the east and the west plus if you really care about the previous MCU movies and the characters in them, you might also avoid watching that movie at all.

I generally enjoy superhero movies.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]This review would be disliked but I have to say this, this was the worst marvel movie after iron Man 2 for me. Some movies have loopholes in their script but this movie has some script in the loopholes. I guess this movie is getting such high reviews(near fight club and Lord of the rings) as people are emotional about the characters and they would think with their heart and not their brain. But if you actually think about the movie, that is , take your brain with you to the theatre, you would start observing the huge loopholes. And I do want to clear it out that I am not a person who is very picky about the story. I accept some flaws in a movie. But in this movie there are so many flaws that it becomes hardly acceptable.

I just watched Endgame and this film made Infinity War look like Thor: The Dark World.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Endgame is a stellar film, through its spectacular visuals, charming characters, epic fight scenes and engrossing narrative. It is a film that shouldn't be possible. If someone told me about this film ten years ago and said it was actually great, I would have laughed in their face. Yet somehow a film of this scale, ten years in the making, was masterfully executed. There was a lot I expected to happen that did but there was tons more I never thought would happen that completely caught me by surprise which is what I truly love about this film.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The first two acts were great, they drove the story forward and gave us some great character moments. The first scene in the film, gave me the first out of many tears that would shed throughout the film. Honestly I have never cried this much in a movie and I would have never thought this would be the film that would make me do that. However the first two acts were flawed, there were a few pacing issues here and there, some problems with the narrative in terms of developing some character moments and other issues.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]However by the third act those problems were completely forgotten. The third act was so grand and epic and was one of the best final hours I have ever witnessed in a movie ever. I would love to talk about it but I am keeping things spoiler three. Just know that you could never imagine how effing spectacular it is. I certainly didn't.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The ending in particular was emotional, heartfelt and immensely engrossing. It was a well deserved pay-off to these last ten years of films and a great satisfying end to it all.

"Avengers: Endgame is meant to be Marvel Studios's god-tier magnum opus that finishes off 11 years of buildup on the highest note possible. Does it succeed? No, not not even close. This movie has some of the worst pacing in this entire franchise, some of the most contrived writing, and some of the biggest plot holes the franchise has ever created. And none of that was something that was made by accident. All of that was achieved solely because the writers/directors wanted to have something in the movie so badly, they ignored their own continuity. They shoved moments and gags that would be sort-of funny or sort-of interesting as standalone moments, but would fall apart when compared to the rest of the continuity. This movie is trying to be like Back to the Future, Lord of the Rings, Inception, and Interstellar at the same time, but manages to not even be half as good as either of them. The only real saving grace in this movie is that there is finally some finality to some of the characters, which was something the MCU always avoided doing because they always used the characters by thinking what will put more money in their valets, not what will have more heart. Oh, and you might be wondering why I don't mention Thanos? Well, no spoilers, but if you expect to be as impressed by him as you were in the previous movie, you're in for disappointment. Overall, this movie was not worth the wait, and this movie will not age well after you'll re-watch it multiple times and see why it's so fundamentally broken.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]4 out 10.",704,neg,neg,neg,neg,

I am not sure that there will be a movie that comes out soon that would take me through remotely similar experience.

Characters act in logical ways and it is simply a joy experiencing and sharing in their time on screen.

"Now Marvel cannot afford a slip, in fact they are the only company that makes movie profits with super profits. When Warner Brosses can allow to divide the Fantastic Beasts not into 3 planned parts, but into 5, in the end they get a part with a low payback due to its filleriness. Yes, Marvel, in my opinion, blundered Captain Marvel with k \ f, it came out very weak in terms of plot, and the graphon was already tired of the 3-4 luminous flash, the film could have pulled out the cosmos, but apparently they didn't have enough money for it detailed display I turn to reviews on the Avengers. The finale, I watched them a week after the premiere, when my friend was able to watch them earlier, I asked him not to spoil and the only thing he said about this: - Avengers 4 is the best I've seen in my life! After watching the film, I stayed at about the same opinion. I'll tell you why. You just need to watch this movie and enjoy it and great work on the little things in it. The film is rich not only in multi-million grafonium, but also in the canonical caste of famous actors, the plot in turn is not as simple as it seemed at first glance, there is a lot of fan service in the film, but this is understandably an era of infinity stones that connected 20 films gone, the saga of infinity is complete, they tried to do it not just pathetically, but beautifully pleasing everyone, they did it with a probability of 100% if you spent at least 10 minutes on the possible plot of 4 parts, it could be in the film, yes surely come true not all theories and predictions, the film is able to surprise (it is very difficult to describe it without spoilers). The twists and turns in the film are so unexpected in places that you do not believe to the last that they went for it. However, the film has a general picture and it looks like you would like to see it, Marvel made it so that I can say with confidence that it couldn't have been better, although again there are questions to the story, but without these blunders there wouldn't be a film As for the tears, I read reviews from other critics and they wrote that they cried a lot on Avengers 4, but I would not say that there were many such moments, but being crying not sentimentally 3 or even 4 times, and most moments when tears came to light in captivity in the first third of the film, but Threat flowed at the end of the film, but they made the right choice, someone came back, someone left, and someone stayed, surely those who left us would be missed, but their end was not just a logical ending, no, their story was told and they were ""let go"" I would give the film the highest rating, it certainly deserves gold, 10 \ 10. I am also pretty sure that in 1-2 weeks the film will overtake the Avatar and become the highest grossing in the history, the film is again worthy. I would like to add more about the ""scene after the credits"", but it isn't, but at the end, after all the captions, when you sit in an empty hall and try to comprehend the film, the sound of a hammer blow on metal sounds, at this point your brain is broken, you have many theories and you do not understand whether it is a reference to the origins of Marvel or a hint of the future ...",720,pos,pos,pos,pos,

"Even though it isn't a happy ending for some but as Robert Downey jr. aka Tony Stark said it doesn't always roll on that way. Part of the journey is the end. No journey is complete without an ending, and Avengers: Endgame brought to the infinity saga the perfect one.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]We saw that the six initial Avengers (the OGs) have evolved each in his own way. Indeed, Tony Stark who's gone from a selfish playboy to a hero who sacrificed his life for the survival of mankind, and he's become a very lovable and protective father and husband. Steve Rodgers has shown us that he is worthy of lifting Mjolnir ( as we would have expected since his scene in Avengers: Age of Ultron where he is trying to lift the hammer and was the closest to succeed ) and by doing so, it shows us that Dr. Abraham Erskine was right all along: Captain America is really pure of heart. Also, by going back in time to continue living his life where he stopped and had this dance with his One is a special and emotional scene. It gives to the character a well deserved and peaceful retirement. He couldn't have missed his date for much longer after all. Now Thor, as we all know, went through a lot of pain; his path wasn't the easiest. Indeed losing most of his people, had his family killed ( except Odin who died peacefully ) and the idea of losing against the mad titan made the god of thunder miserable. But after his confrontation with his now dead mother, and some pep talk offered by Rocket, he regained hope. In addition, by lifting his old hammer we can see that Thor was still worthy even after he battled with anger and depression. Hulk has gone from a wild, angry uncontrollable beast to a more intelligent and sentimental one. Bruce Banner finally gained control over the monster inside of him. The story of Natasha Romanoff is a sadder story, in fact she turned from a lone wolf to a wolf who works better with a pack. If you didn't get my metaphor, Black Widow didn't trust anybody. She was always vigilant with the others. But the Avengers gave her a family, they were the only people she could trust. So sacrificing her self for the better good of her new familia is a huge changing for the character. And at last but not at least Clint Barton aka Hawkeye aka Ronin. He turned from a caring father to an assassin who's gone rogue. After his family turned to dust, his only goal was killing bad guys, but when hope came knocking to his door he was ready to sacrifice himself to bring his family back.",723,pos,neg,pos,pos,

Because the anticipation for this movie was at an all time high, the recent movies (mainly superhero movies) before it were practically to help the audience clench it's thirst for this masterpiece.

Thus Endgame... the movie is a very thought provoking film that takes its jab at a very hard plot that most films don't crack quite well since ""back to the future"" this film manages to make so much story and characters and plot develop and marinate in such a well crafted movie that I can't even describe upon words.

Within 3 hours of this movie 1.5 hours was of repetitions. After all the hype, theories & speculations, All that Anthony & Joe Russo cooked was a plot that even a Kindergarten MCU fan could've scripted better and Many succeeded with their far Superior imagination & theories than MCU team. Time Travel is a pathetic excuse to deal with Thanos after all the wonderful Avengers Series MCU has executed on Cinematic world Arena. It felt like they knew Endgame would be the Big Hit so they served the old potpourri with not more than 10 minutes of WOW action moments. Stan Lee's demise affected the outcome of this Movie that could have been the Milestone for Cinema Entertainment for Years to come.

The fact that the film manages to be THIS good more than makes up for its few flaws.

"It's been a long old journey since Robert Downey Jr started to build the MCU in a desert cave with nothing more than a trademark smirk and a high-powered quip. Back then the Iron Man suit was bodged together from scrap and imagination, a clunky knight's armour that clanked with destructive heavy metal weight rather than the fizz and pop weapon of mass entertainment it later became. Endgame is a fitting tribute to the journey this unlikeliest of superheroes (genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist) has brought us all on.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]All the things you might have speculated about to make this grandest of finales work probably doesn't happen, of course, but enough of the chit chat was on the mark to let the fanboys pat themselves on the back. After Infinity War everyone left alive is dealing with things in their own way and the world has moved on as best it can with the leftovers scattered and scarred; given how the universe ended up with 50% of living things disappeared from existence this was always going to be a film about how to fix things so that the MCU could move on with its film and TV and merch slate intact - you don't kill the franchise that lays the universe's first billion-dollar weekend.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The mission, should our superheroes accept it, means some assembling and avengering has to be done again so they can do the improbable against the impossible to take on the inevitable. How it's done doesn't matter as much as the nostalgia ride it takes us on. It's an accomplished bit of story-telling that manages to bring 11 years of franchise work together in a way that propels the action forward without getting too bogged down with unnecessary filler - everyone has their part to play, and true to their characters there are plenty of thrills and more than enough laughs to keep things light.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]However, there are so many nods to so many characters that it does descend into a spot the cameo competition at times. While it can be fun to play along it's also the point at which things flounder slightly, feeling more like a necessary roll call to check who's attending the Endgame CGI bish bash boshery. That said, and with only one or two minor exceptions, there is a very satisfying sense of completion to this heroic journey.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]In the beginning there was one man in a cave with an iron will to survive, now there's a universe where everyone's lives have been touched, character arcs have been fulfilled, technology in the stories exists at the point of being magical, and everything is possible.

I thought the film makers did an amazing job at really giving us the time to connect with each and every super hero in this franchise if we hadn't thus far. Doing so really helped set the stage for the ""Endgame"", if you will. I really enjoyed the main characters throughout this film as well. I thought Thanos had wiped out the majority of my favorites with his infinity stone snap, but I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed the remaining characters and how well they worked together throughout the film.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Also, I just can't say enough about how beautiful the Marvel films are and how well the CGI, costumes, and FX are done.

But most people I saw it with were ultimately (at least somewhat) disappointed.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Worst performance in the movie is easily Mark Ruffalo who has now solidified his legacy as the absolute worst Hulk and Banner ever committed to film.

"Endgame was the most hyped film of the season for three reasons. One is the shocking anti climax of infinity war which ends with a cliffhanger. Second it was rumored to be the last film of most of our favorite characters due to various reasons so fans were mentally preparing themselves to see them for the last time and say them goodbye. And last is that the makers remained tightlipped regarding the film which increased the curiosity level of the audience. With all the hype, does endgame meet your expectations? Let's find out.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Positives: The film is divided into three acts. Though the first act is slow its very intense and emotional. The second act was the most entertaining where time travelling is done as it has many funny moments. And the third act was action packed which provide you goosebumps and in end makes you emotional.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Now let's talk about our favorite characters.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]1. Iron man: With 3 standalone movies, main lead in all avengers films, second lead in civil war, a cameo in incredible hulk and an extended cameo in homecoming, RDJ kept on earning the love of audience making him the God of MCU. In endgame, he once again win your hearts. Your heartbreaks when you see him skinny and weak in the beginning. He had some heartwarming moments with his daughter and also when he hugs his father while time travelling. And in the end when he snaps saying his epic line ""I am iron man"" and dies he nails a heroic image among audience. Don't know how MCU will be without him. We love you 3000. 2. Captain America: My favorite character in MCU. In 8 years cap's character was constant being a serious, mature and no nonsense Steve Rogers. In first avenger and the avengers everyone felt him as a boring character. But in winter soldier, he proved that he can be badass like James bond and Ethan hunt. In age of ultron he got a bit sidelined whereas though civil war was his film audience saw it as an avengers film. Plus, he earned the wrath of iron man fans for hiding Tony's parents murder and they mocked him saying that if bucky wasn't there then iron man would have killed him in the end. Later in infinity war he got less significance though he was given a great intro. In endgame, he plays a very crucial role who keeps on motivating his friends. And I thank Russo brothers for giving him the most epic scene where he lift Thor's mjolinir. That scene showed what cap is worthy of. And he gets a happy ending where he time travels and goes back to Peggy. Thank you Chris Evans for making Captain America my favorite character. 3. Black widow: though we miss her badass action in endgame she wins our hearts for sacrificing herself for the soul stone. Especially the fight between her and Clint to die for soul stone is tension packed.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Negatives: I can't believe how Russo brothers ruined the character of Thor whose fan following grew leaps and bounds with ragnarok and infinity war making him the second favorite avenger. I understand that he was depressed for not going for the head and it was fine showing him as a fat drunkard but in the end at least he could have given him some elevation. I liked professor hulk but we missed his smash. Also we wanted a rematch of him and thanos. Time travel concept is confusing and compared to infinity war, thanos character was less explored here.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Verdict: On the whole, endgame is a highly entertaining and engaging film despite being for 3 hours. But compared to infinity war it was not that satisfying. It will be a treat for iron man and cap fans. Thank you avengers for entertaining us for 7 years.",879,pos,pos,pos,pos,

"Barring a few shoddy fillers here and there, Marvel's Infinity War saga has been an otherwise enjoyable experience otherwise. However, Avengers: Endgame fails to live up to the expectations set up by its predecessors. The concept of time travel, while quite alluring is ridiculously tough to get right and the Endgame is brave but poor attempt.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The movie is riddled with plot holes and at many places the scenes just feel redundant. You could very well skip a decent part of the movie and trust me, it would hardly make a difference in the end. Major characters like Captain Marvel, Thor and Dr. Strange were underutilized and definitely warranted more screen time.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]There are a few positives that would still keep you going. The fight scenes are great as usual. Characters like the Iron Man and the Hulk manage to salvage a decent part of the film. The ending is quite predictable so despite the great action scenes, it fails to leave any significant mark.",881,pos,pos,pos,pos,

"On an introductory note, I've noticed a few scattered, rather negative (1-5 stars) reviews here, and most of them seem to be complaining about pace, lack of action, plot-holes, ""Hulk did this"", ""Thor did that"", etc. and certainly everyone is entitled to their opinion. However, a good majority of these reviews sound like they're coming from people who had jumped way too hard on the hype train, had ridiculously high expectations, or have invested a majority of their life in the MCU. Additionally, if (hypothetically) the pace and action of ""Endgame"" had followed the same style as ""Infinity War"" these same bedroom-dwelling critics would likely complain ""OMG! The pace and action was too similar to Infinity War! I'm so disappointed... blah blah blah"". And if ""Endgame"" somehow outpaced its predecessor with more action and fight scenes, most movie goers would likely be nauseated with an abundance of CG and a more confusing story-line.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Now, on to my review (sort of) short, sweet, and spoiler free. I've seen nearly all of the Marvel movies except 2 or 3 of them, and I've never witnessed anything like ""Endgame"" and I don't think I ever will again, in this lifetime anyway. While Endgame wasn't as fun and action-packed as a few other movies (including Infinity War), it was an emotional, complete masterpiece of movie-making. I felt like I was watching several Marvel movies all wrapped up into one nicely designed package. Even though it all happened in a span of about 3 hours and the pace was rather slow in the first half, it never felt like the film was dragging and I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Although Endgame was somewhat flawed and had some disappointing and confusing moments (a tiny, small spoiler: the time travel' stuff), character issues and lost opportunities for a more redeeming scene/moment, I never felt these very minor issues detracted any of the movie's story and overall feel and atmosphere throughout. Not afraid to admit this but for one of the rarest moments in my life, I cried during a few various scenes for very obvious reasons. In my opinion, ""The Avengers: Endgame"" is not only one of the top Marvel movies ever made, but will stand the test of time as one of the greatest movies made during the 21st century. Having said all of that, I'll probably visit the theater one or two more times, as should everyone :)",895,pos,neg,pos,pos,

"I'm going to make a leap here, just to leep things simple. The cumulative effect of so called ""super heroes"" is to the true film fan what the white man was to Native Americans: End of life as they knew it. There are 25 actors in this, and it's really sad to see them become prostitutes, like their studios. Why do you think great actors and directors wouldn't be caught dead in these cartoon films? Because they are the antithesis to great film making. Its really sad. I understand my 13 year old daughter seeing something like this. I don't understand older, more mature people acting like these are real films becauseT they arent. They are like the cartoons you woukd watch, before the main attraction started. They all have been dumbed down for the masses to the same exact plot: Good versus Evil; always. I wouldn't, no couldn't; sit through 15 minute of this pablum, not even if you paid me a year's salary to watch. It""s woeful trash, and is ruining the film industry. Stanley Kubrick the master of all the great directors, is rolling over in his grave. You won't see the top directors making any of this trash. People like Abel Ferrara, Marty Scorcese, Ridley Scott, William Friedkin, Spike Lee, or Denis Villeneuve go near a movie such as this. Its all publicity! All you hear about is how much money is made in the opening weeks, but nothing about what the films are like. It makes me sick. I would rather have my teeth drilled without novacaine than watch this. The same goes for the best actors. No way you will see ever see people like Bobby DeNiro, Christopher Walken, Matt Damon, Colin Farrell, Ethan Hawke, Nicole Kidman, or Al Pacino in any of these movies. I understand completely. It's simple. They have integrity! Skip this woeful hyped up trash and go see a real film; not a cartoon.",904,pos,pos,pos,pos,

The fan moments are justified then, because of the writing and the story offers balance. There is no shortage of humor, as you would expect; It has become a stapel to have in a Marvel movie. I can connect with the characters (protaganists) who after losing to Thanos in Infinty War must accept that defeat and move on with that sour taste still in their mouths. This is something most of us have more than likely had to deal with at one point or another in their lives: Defeat and how to pick ourselves up after losing. People can say what they want about the different issues and ""plotholes"" but honestly, ""Avengers Endgame"" closes out this phase in the MCU in such an epic way..

I don't know how many times I plan on watching it but it is worth every penny no matter how many times you plan on watching it because it's that good. Forget good, it's great. Forget great, its spectacular.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Avengers Endgame takes place immediately after last year's heart-stopping Infinity War cliffhanger where our surviving heroes are in grief of what happened and the rest for you to watch. This is by far the best Marvel movie ever made. Endgame is the conclusion of a journey we've all been going throughout 22 movies. It is a worthy end to the original six Avengers arcs, leaving space for our new superheroes to take their place and lead a whole new generation of Marvel-lous storytelling. But let's not talk about the future, we are focusing on Endgame here.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Unlike Infinity War, the stakes are higher, the drama is wells up in you constantly and the sheer epicness of what makes this Avengers installment so perfect is that from beginning to end, you will laugh, cry or have goosebumps all over your body. The highlight of the movie was, of course, our beloved six original Avengers, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye. Making them the main focus once again after so long was a step at the right direction and it would totally make sense since we all know that Endgame will be their last movie together. The best among them all was Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans. Finally seeing them together after havoc that was Civil War and working together, trusting each other again was an absolute treat for all us fans.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I can't tell you anything about the storyline for that I would be spoiling you but I can tell you the 3 hour runtime was worth it. Come to think of it, it didn't feel like I was watching it for 3 hours for that I wasn't bored or looking at the time. No scene felt pointless or draggy. The entire 3 hours keeps you attentive, at the edge of your seat and makes sure your eyes do not get to miss a single second. The pace seemed familiar to all famous fantasy epics such as Lord of The Rings and Game of Thrones. Like LOTR and GOT, they focused more on character development and getting the audience to experience what the characters going through as well. With that, there are the epic battle scenes and the epic score to go with it. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely outdid themselves making their most complicated and best Marvel script ever. Alan Silvestri returned to write the score once again and outdid himself by including themes from all the previous movies including his previous scores from Captain America The First Avenger and the main Avengers theme by making it them sound more brassier and bigger, fitting the to the scope and tone of Endgame.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]So, Endgame. Go watch it. Marvel fan or not, do not miss the epic finale to the Infinity Saga of the MCU. If you do end up missing it, you should live under rock or kill yourself with a rock. With that I'm rating Avengers Endgame 12/10 because it exceeded all my expectations of a great Marvel movie. I thought Infinity War was spectacular but Endgame, there is still no words I can find to explain what the movie or how it made me feel, not only as a Marvel but as a moviegoer which makes Endgame even more of a superhero spectacle than Infinity War.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]P.S. unfortunately, there is no post credit scenes or end credit scenes",911,pos,pos,pos,pos,

"Today I saw ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019), directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and many, many more. Oh man, what a cast! Just like ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018), I was blown away by this film. The Russo brothers have done it again! Great story, great acting, great special effects, great sets/locations, and great soundtrack. Every factor is top-notch in this movie! I am not going to spoil this movie. This is all I'm going to say about it. Is this the best superhero movie? No, there are some I personally like better. But, it's in my top 10 best Marvel movies for sure, if not top 5! Overall, the cast is extraordinary, and every character had their own shining moment. I was kind of skeptical about Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. Most of you know that I absolutely hate the Ant-Man comic book character. Nothing against Paul Rudd, but the movie version of Ant-Man is very obnoxious. I was worried he was going to ruin it with one-liners and jokes. But, to my surprise, he was not that bad. He played a critical factor in this movie, and his jokes were few and far between, and actually funny! The other characters are stellar as usual. Under the direction of the Russo Brothers, that's not surprising! That's all I'm going to say, I will not spoil the Endgame. You'll have to go see the movie to find out how good it is for yourself! Believe me, you won't be the same. If you think you know what this movie will be like from watching the trailers, you have no idea what you're in for! Props to you, Anthony and Joe Russo. You guys did a Marvel-ous job again! I look forward to other future movies with your involvement, and I hope you continue to direct other superhero movies in the future! This movie is absolutely worth the money to see it in the theater and also to buy on DVD. Obviously, I give this film a full 5 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Avengers: Endgame"" yet, what are you waiting for? Go check it out if you haven't already!

"I'm not going to spoil anything. Overall, the movie was enjoyable, but those 2 first hours... So many plot holes. If you're someone with a minimum of logic and appreciate intelligent writing, chances are you'll get mad a couple times in the first 2 acts. However, that last hour was THE best segment I have ever scene in a superhero movie. It was really epic and everything you probably hoped for. It really saved the movie and boosted my rating. The rest of the movie would've been a 6-7 in my opinion. It's definitely not the best MCU movie like some hardcore fans are pretending it to be, but you still have to see the movie. The conclusion is very satisfying! You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cheer. I even had goosebumbs at one point, and I'm not even a HUGE fan of the MCU. It's a must see. Enjoy!",917,pos,pos,pos,pos,

"Endgame was written to be the epic conclusion of 20-plus marvel movies. It is a good conclusion but not an 'epic' one. Every character is given a good arch and heartfelt moments. The movie just lacks the magic of Infinity War. There are very few fight scenes until the big fight at the end, and I just found myself getting impatient, waiting for something to happen. The plot was jumping around a lot and sometimes things just seemed to happen so quickly, which is weird when many scenes seemed to drag on. Nebula contributed heavily to the plot, but I don't think it made enough sense, and it also makes Nebula the most annoying character, as she already gave away the soul stones location in Infinity War. Everything about Hulk felt off, and Captain Marvel just didn't fit in. To be fair, there are some amazing moments in the final act, and I finally got the action I was craving. But by then, I had somewhat disconnected for the movie. What I loved about Infinity War is it starts with amazing momentum and never stops. Endgame took just a little too long to establish itself. Even once the Avengers start executing their plan, there is very little action or epic moments. I also think Thanos was underplayed in the movie, as were the use of the infinity stones or any superhero powers. The heroes definitely could've played around more with their settings as well. Maybe it will be better when watched in conjunction with Infinity War, and maybe I'm a little too much of a Thanos fan. All in all, it's a good watch but the movie failed to make me feel the emotions I felt from Infinity War.",926,pos,neg,neg,pos,

"Don't get me wrong I really do enjoy Marvel movies but i'm not a die-hard fan where I have seen every movie tons of times, read all the comics, andknow all the characters. With that said, that will definitely be a big factor on how much you will enjoy this. The more you know about Marvel, its characters, and the universe, the more you will enjoy it. Even for casual fans like myself it's still a really enjoyable experience with some enjoyable action, some pretty good comedic moments, and some heartfelt moments. In the beginning I was still trying to figure out who's who. It was difficult to discern who was who at the beginning (it didn't help either that there were very few name drops) but as it went on I started to get it more (and some characters like Iron Man and Thanos were easily recognizable.) And no, i'm not going to spoil anything in this review (most of the Internet has already done that anyways). But even with a bit of confusion it was far from enough to keep this from being an enjoyable watch. Plus it's not the movie's fault as that's how most of these movies are, depending on strong continuity and targeting the fan base more than anyone else. However it was pretty cool that they included scenes from some of their previous movies like the original Avengers, Thor: The Dark World, and Captain America The Winter Soldier, but have it fit in with the time-travel aspect of this movie.Even for a casual fan like myself I was able to pinpoint which movies they were (thanks to the movie indicating what years each were taking place). It also didn't feel too out-of-place (albeit feeling a little weird to see the scenes pop up here.) It would have been nice if the movie started out with a little recap of what happened before and included scenes from previous movies to tie the story together, but it was still cool that they added those scenes in. I was skeptical of the three-hour running time but the movie managed to make it feel like it went by relatively quickly. It was also awesome that so many characters from all the different movies were in here. However it was a bit disappointing that I felt like some didn't get enough screen time like Spider-Man and Doctor Strange. Even Thanos didn't have as much screen time as I expected. But their appearances were still enjoyable and the final battle was AWESOME with all the characters coming together to help the Avengers out. It's easily the highlight of the movie (as it should be).[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Remember that this review was from a perspective of someone who hasn't watched a lot of these movies (and some were so long ago that it almost feels like I haven't watched them at all.)

"I'm assuming the low ratings are by comic book nerds. This movie was amazing. A laughed out loud, by myself, many times and cried a lot. I'm really surprised by how much considering this is just a block buster super hero movie. The thing is, I actually like movies. And I know they are entertainment. Are there holes in the time travel plot? Sure, but who cares. Just use your imagination to fill in the holes. Or don't think about it too much. It's not real life folks. I'm just grateful I live in the exact period of time where movies like this are possible. It's amazing what they can do. Imagine someone from the 1920's or 1820's saw this? Be grateful. This movie was a masterpiece. If you want less plot holes, watch a film, or read a book. This is a movie. And a damn good one.",951,pos,pos,pos,pos,

"'Avengers: Endgame' (or ""Avengers 4"") is the culmination of 21 films of inter-connected storytelling and while it's not the best film ever made (although it may end up the highest-grossing), it is certainly a fitting conclusion to one of cinemas most ambitious undertakings. If you haven't seen enough Marvel films to understand what's going on (what have you been doing!?), you'll still probably enjoy this, but a lot of backstory and character knowledge is assumed. This film follows on directly from 'Avengers: Infinity War', but it definitely helps if you've seen 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' and 'Captain Marvel' since then.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]OK, some things that will help outline the film, but I don't think are spoiler: Scott/Ant-Man (Rudd) and Clint/Hawkeye (Renner) get plenty of screen time, seeing as they weren't in 'Infinity War'. Natasha/Black Widow (Johansson) and Bruce/Hulk (Ruffalo) also have a bit more to do, which is fitting, giving all the original Avengers time to shine. Thor (Hemsworth) still gets plenty of great jokes. But, as always, this is the Steve & Tony show, with Steve/Captain America (Evans) and Tony/Iron Man (Downey Jr.), reconnecting and leading the Avengers as they try to undo what Thanos (Brolin) did to the universe in 'Infinity War'.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Plot-wise, I don't think it's a spoiler to say there's some time travel involved. It's not totally out of the realms of what we've seen happen in other films, so you can go along with it. This obviously leads to some funny throw-backs/sentimental moments with other characters. Some of the start/middle is a bit of a slog, but it's all set-up for the end, and they can't be too happy & having fun after what happened. The final act is very satisfying, but also quite emotional and sad in parts. It's handled quite well.

The story is slow and seems like they didnt care at all how it ended. The fight scene is rushed and you get to see each person take one swing then they are out. Infinity Wars set up an amazing open end and Endgame ruins 10 years of Marvel films. I am no longer a fan of Marvel. Thanks for the decade long build up to this.

"This is made by people who do, for people who do, and this movie itself, does, love the MCU. You can think of it as a TV show finale. After 21 episodes that are all feature length. And before you can even say ""oh no those are all terrible"", this immediately proves itself to be an exception to that rule. Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn't mean it doesn't have any. Or that they're anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren't, all get significant depth. I remain one of the few people who argue that Age of Ultron did deliver that, albeit in small concentrated format. This easily tops that. Everyone is pushed into a situation new to them. The trailers hint at some of these, whilst leaving others as incredible surprises. Make sure you avoid spoilers before watching this.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]This picture moves fast and packs a lot into its not quite lean running time. In other words, it's directed by the Russo Brothers. The length is justified. I wouldn't cut anything from this. The emotional moments don't feel sappy. The countless callbacks and references don't feel like they're just there to make you feel good for paying attention to all that lead to this one. The acting shows just how well all of these performers understand the characters. And the screenplay does the same for the writers. The effects are astonishing, yet again getting us to care about individuals that we know are all CG. It uses the varied skills, equipment and the like, of the unique heroes and villains, creatively. This delivers deeply satisfying closure. It truly is a conclusion. It's not trying to get you back to the theatre for the next adventure. The few currently confirmed entries into this franchise don't need hyping, anyway. Spider-Man with Mysterio? Another Black Panther story? The unfairly fired James Gunn returning to round out the trilogy of the Guardians of the Galaxy? Solo Black widow, *finally*? More Dr Strange? Shang-Chi, The Eternals, Blade? Keep 'em coming.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I recommend this to everyone who's taken this entire journey.

"Once again I debated with myself, whether I should write a review here. I know most of you won't like what I want to say. I also know with over 4500 reviews already here, most of those who may agree with me, won't even get to see it. It will simply get lost in the sea of fake reviews (paid or otherwise) flooding most of internet sites dedicated to such things. But eventually I decided that keeping what I want to say, in my belly will hurt more. So - here goes:[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]It's a great film based on a few false premises, some of which I already discussed here more than once. See on my review page what I've written about Infinity War, or Captain Marvel. In my personal book, every time a comics superhero dies, somebody made a mistake he (or she), didn't know how to fix. The control directors and script writers have over this sort of material is un limited. So if people don't like the character, and I mean real people not review writers that have a personal grudge against superheroines, because the actress is Israeli or because she was made too strong. If real people don't like the character, you wrote it wrong. Let's agree, it didn't happen here. People love the MCU characters, they were all beautifully written, and each actor performing them did wonders. They became as real as fictional characters can. So I knew what happened in this movie had to happen. I even wrote so in my review for infinity war. I must admit, I didn't guess the way they'll go about it, but I knew the many franchises, stemming from the MCU couldn't end. It wasn't a secrete, they kept on working on some sequells while working on this movie. And still, they did surprise me (and everybody else too). But, this sort of a surprise, dosn't cut it for me. Let's carry on with the toy box imagery, that the Russo brothers spoke about in their own IMDb interview. Think about going to play with your friend, he/she shows you a boxful of amazing toys, ""I love them to pieces"" they say, and the very next thing they take out a hummer and break some of them to smithereens. Surprise you? didn't I"" yes, you sure did, but you're an idiot. And the fact, the entire movie prooves you're not, is making it even worse.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]There's no reason in the world to drive the franchise this way, apart from the ego of the people having all the toys, their stupid wish to surprise us and to proove they really can do whatever they want.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I may have high esteem for their abilities.

The movie present us an incredible balancing between nostalgia and novelty, you will scream, laugh and cry, it is the Marvel recipe elevated to the highest level. There's just so much in it, that I can't even write about it without spoiling everything.

"Where do you begin with this film? I doubt there's that many people who turn up to the cinema (or pick out a random DVD etc) and see a film called 'Avengers: Endgame' and decide to watch it without really knowing anything about it. Basically, it's the finale to a series of 21 (I think!) films which have spanned over an eleven year period. So, do you need to watch all those films before watching 'Endgame?' No. But it sure helps![?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]However, to give the most briefest of summaries, 'Avengers: Endgame' is a superhero movie where Earth's mightiest heroes come together to right the wrongs of a bad purple dude called 'Thanos' who has only gone and wiped out exactly 50% of the universe by collecting a load of magic (on 'infinity' to give them their proper name) stones and then putting him in his equally magic glove and snap his fingers to achieve this feat. Luckily, Earth still has enough heroes left to stop him.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]If - and I find this hard to believe - you have never watched anything that has come before it, you may just about get what's going on. There are battles, shocks, surprises, plenty of action and computer-generated characters in crazy worlds and locations. So it's fun. But I think that's a severe minority who will view it like that. For the rest of us - particularly people like me who have been following the franchise from the very beginning - will see it through completely different eyes. We will get every last reference and portion of 'fan service' (and there is plenty of that).[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I won't go into details because this could well be the biggest cinematic/filmic event to date. Franchises like 'James Bond' may have had more installments, but they were individual stories and didn't all link up and come together in one almighty conclusion. So this is the longest-running story ever on film (yes, I know you can probably watch the previous entries on their own and understand them as one-offs). In contains all the endings you'll need for your favourite characters, such as Thor, Iron Man and Captain America. All three superheroes are played - as usual - to perfection by Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans. If you've followed these characters since the beginning, you won't fail to be moved by watching their various conclusions.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I loved it, but it's not without it's flaws. It's worth noting that it's over three hours long and, for all its fan service, it does tend to drag in one or two areas. Plus it's quite 'exposition heavy' meaning characters have to explain the 'science' of various fantastical events for us - the audience - to properly understand the ways they're going to dig themselves out of such a hole as restoring the other half of the universe's population.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]However, if you've watched the majority of what's come before 'Endgame' then you'll probably sit through this and enjoy it to various levels. I've seen plenty other reviews and most - if not all - have been positive about the film. I don't know where the MCU (or 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' to be correct) will go from here. I'm sure it'll be good, but - for some reason - I just can't see it ever living up to the hype and novelty of this first 'phase' of the overall story.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Oh, and for those who weren't too taken with Brie Larson's 'Captain Marvel' character - don't worry - she's not in it that much.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]https://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.com/",989,pos,pos,neg,pos,

"I usually do not watch movies twice in such a short amount of time. But after I did the Double Feature (at the Midnight premiere) with Infinity War almost 2 weeks ago, I re-watched Endgame yesterday and it was as amazing as my first impression of it was! And while I will not spoil anything about Endgame, I will talk about things Infinity War! So if you have not seen that yet, do not blame me for anything revealed here.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]My summary is a pop culture reference and there are quite a few in the Marvel movies, hinting at other franchises (Alien got name checked for example in Infinity War and even ""copied"" or ""homaged"" if you will and there are a few in Endgame too). But those little digs are not too important, they are just nice touches for those who know them. Having an understanding of the MCU as a whole, from Phase 1 to now Phase 3 is way more important. And as someone who is not too familiar with the comics myself, I can tell you that knowing the movies is enough to enjoy the franchise.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Still you can google the other stuff or even make your own conclusions. Now that is a lot of foreword and I haven't even gotten one word about Endgame. But as I said above, no spoilers here. What we do know (from the trailers) is the beginning.

Now what?[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Yes the first hour of the movie is ""slow"", but it had to be. There are ramifications after the snap and the characters we learned to love, that we have close to our heart, have been torn apart. Quite literally gone with the wind - everyone is thinking how is this going to be resolved (no pun intended)? And the movie will give you answers, and will even try to sort of explain things that are quite - unexplainable.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]And while there is full on drama, there is still a lot of humor. The movie takes beloved characters and does things to them - or rather the weight of what happened does things to them. What exactly? Well that would be telling, but let me tell you some very bold choices have been made. And if you are not emotional at least during some scenes, you are taking away a lot of fun for yourself.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I can be a cynic too at times, but taking this apart (which you can do with every movie), is only hurting your own viewing pleasure. There is so much love in this, for the characters, for details, for the fans - it's just a rollercoaster and I'm not afraid to say that I shed a couple of tears. It is after all tying knots and bringing certain things to a conclusion.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]That doesn't mean there isn't anything more coming (because we know there is, next up Spiderman as an in between movie before Infinity War?). And there are some familiar faces coming back to Endgame from other movies that we haven't seen in a while but also new cameos like Ken Jeong. I'm guessing there will be a deleted scene with him, his scene seems to short for storytelling purposes I reckon.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Epic fights, epic emotions and dialog that is hinting at things to come later in the movie ... which you will see even clearer with repeat viewing(s) ... The Russos did it - Kudos to them, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee (RIP) and everyone else involved in this of course[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Edit: Endgame works even for people who have not seen a single MCU movie yet (confirmed by a friend of mine). But of course the gravitas and the conclusions of everything will work way better if you have seen the rest of the movies. Also let me add that this is ""technically sound"" as some would put it - or just plain great visually speaking. But I reckon this is a given anyway.

Had my dose of Avengers Endgame today. Started off pretty good and was going along fairly well then i said to my partner what happened to Captain Marvel she is hardly mentioned in the movie so far. Moving along the movie gets very serious and lots of laughs and crying and the going back in time comes up and they work out how and why. Stilling enjoying the movies but still wondering when CM is going to make another appearance . Great scenes followed with lost friends and family and time for the big battle and boy was it was battle when all seemed to be lost guess who made an appearance ever so short and sweet. The battle ended with the good guys coming out victorious and a little twist at the end . Gave it 9 stars not 10 as they could of done better hopefully there will be more captain marvel movies as i was left thinking is that it for her one movie and small parts in the Endgame.,996,pos,neg,neg,neg,XXXXXX

I've found the previous movies to be entertaining and I've enjoyed watching them for the most part, but I have never be blown away after seeing one until now. All I can say is WOW! I never thought I would experience such a wide range of raw emotion from watching an Avengers movie. The acting was incredible, the story line was rich and the pace of the movie and how it unfolded was spot on. There was never a point where I felt the movie was dragging on or plateaued. Usually I wouldn't be able to sit through a 3 hour movie (even my 5 year old was engaged in the movie the entire time - crazy, right?!) without falling asleep but I honestly didn't want this movie to end. It had just the right amount of action and heart felt drama. It wasn't predictable in the least- characters or storyline. They incorporated all of the characters flawlessly and it was impossible for me to not fall in love with every single one of them. I experienced so much joy from the humor alone because it was genuine humor and not full of the typical cliche jokes and one liners that some of the past Avengers movies have had. On the other side of the coin, the movie is a tearjerker. I don't think there was a dry eye in the entire theatre during the sad parts-my eleven year old son and my boyfriend were even tearing up. I would definitely recommend this movie a thousand times over. You will NOT be disappointed.",1000,pos,pos,neg,pos,

The whole plot though we knew it included timetravel completely surprised and three hours just flight by. I enjoyed the movie and also understood the sobbing of some people in the audience during specific scenes. Overall i just can't give less than 10 stars simply due to the fact that this movie wraps up 11years of pure joy in my opinion. I only disliked the fact that they had to introduce cpt marvel in her own movie just for 5min screentime. Femme fatale scene also was not necessary at all. Black Widows prequel would have been a way better choice so we could understand her action better. Cpt.

"No matter how it turned out, I would have nothing but respect for what the filmmakers behind the MCU managed to pull off in just over a decade. A slate of 21 movies sharing characters, themes and story-lines - connected by a joint goal to get the audience and the characters to one harmonious conclusion. After 2018, in which we got one of the MCU's finest films in Black Panther, and surely their most ambitious (at that time) in Avengers: Infinity War, the pressure for Avengers: Endgame to deliver on a decade of build-up and potential seemed like an impossible task.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I can't help but think of what happened with Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. We started with a terrific punch of fresh air in Batman Begins. Then Nolan made what is considered by many to be the best superhero film ever made in The Dark Knight (it's not my personal favorite, but I do love it). TDK became one the most successful and highly-praised films of all time. Then the pressure - how could the third film in that trilogy possibly live up? The answer: it didn't. The Dark Knight Rises was a thoroughly entertaining, well-acted movie. But it was riddled with plot-holes and conveniences that contributed to a film that simply could not help but feel disappointing compared to what came before it.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I say all that to say this: Avengers: Endgame lives up not only to its terrific predecessors from last year, but also the entire 21-film run that came before it. It serves as both a conclusion to and celebration of all the films that led up to it. It delivers on every single expectation (at least from this fan) and then exceeds them. It is as epic a film as the industry makes in this time, and there isn't a minute of the three hour run time I would shave. So many of the little easter eggs and sly moments from the past decade of these movies are called back in brilliant and inventive ways, while at the same time delivering something completely new.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]While I liked Infinity War, my biggest complaint was that the film's editing felt jarring. It had the task of juggling many story-lines (and I respect the monumental effort), but it seemed like it just shuffled between them too quickly - rarely giving us time to mourn for lost characters or fully soak in important events. Endgame completely fixes this issue. This is a master class in film editing and if the Oscars ignore it in that category come awards season, it will truly be a blemish on their continually tarnishing record. It does take its time, but in the best way possible. When characters face dark or emotional circumstances, we truly feel them. These are characters we, the audience, have bonded with for over a decade. And all of that emotional connection pays off perfectly.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Another great highlight is that many characters who fans feel have been kinda left out the last few films get big and important story-lines in this film, finally moving from supporting players to huge plot-shifters. It's great to see so many great characters finally living up to their full potential.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Everything else works. There's a reasonable amount of humor to balance out the heavy drama. Every actor delivers some of their finest (if not their best) work in this series. The special effects are phenomenal. Character design, production design, and cinematography continue to hold up the high standards set by other great films in this franchise.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I really don't know how Kevin Feige, the Russo brothers, and their talented team of filmmakers and actors pulled this thing off. It's quite a feat. I go see a lot of movies in the theater as its my preferred viewing venue, and this is easily one of the most enjoyable movie-going experiences I've ever had.

All the remaining Avengers reunite to stop Thanos, no matter what the consequences.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Avengers: Endgame is a mind-blowing film. Directors Anthony Russo & Joe Russo have given us an absolutely satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga, which consists of all 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies which have released, so far. The emotional moments make you shed a tear or two. Don't worry though. The comedic moments are aplenty, as well. The effortless chemistry & the banter among all the Avengers, remains intact. The action set pieces are glorious. The climactic set piece is the highlight of the film. You will cheer till you no longer can, as so many moments will bring you pure & unadulterated joy! The visual effects are brilliant. The 3D is eye-popping. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Chris Evans is outstanding as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Chris Hemsworth is incredible as Thor. Scarlett Johansson is unforgettable as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is superb as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Don Cheadle is effective as James Rhodes/War Machine. Paul Rudd is amazing as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Brie Larson is awesome as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. Karen Gillan is awe-inspiring as Nebula. Danai Gurira is impressive as Okoye. Bradley Cooper is hysterical as Rocket. Josh Brolin is flawless as Thanos. The supporting cast is scene-stealing in their respective roles. Avengers: Endgame is a must watch.

"Avengers: Endgame is less of a movie and more of an event. It celebrates 11 years of superhero cinema while also commemorating itself as just a huge, huge event. As something like this, it works very well. As a movie, on the other hand, there are severe flaws.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Now that isn't to say that I hate Avengers: Endgame- in fact, I really enjoyed the film. However, as genuinely enjoyable as the second half is, the first half is slow-paced, lifeless, and drags on. Sure, that's the intention given the fact that half of life only remains, but that doesn't aid in the fact that it still feels a bit long and disjointed at times. It doesn't quite have a flowing narrative or genuine structure, it just plays out as a series of overemotional filler.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The second half (and the time travel scenes), on the other hand, is immensely fun and entertaining. I'm not here to talk time-travel mumbo jumbo so I'm gonna be ignoring those flaws, The climax and the aftermath of it are both incredible and really give the film its identity; a huge, grand-scale spectacle of a film and a sight to behold.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame is a far from perfect movie, but it's still solid and delivers a spectacular ending for not just itself, but for the MCU.

A good 40-60 minutes aka the build up phase were focused on PTSD from Civil/Infinity War and overcoming it by using Ant Man Quantum Realm as a catalyst to the story.

Particularly the third act kept me shivering, my heart pounding so hard in my chest, just hoping not to have a stroke until the credits finished rolling. Marvel did it again: made us, a considerable bunch of grown-ups turning in for midnight premiere, leave the premises with wet eyes. It's true what they say: it is a brilliantly, beautiful, well-crafted love letter to us Marvel fans who have grown together with these characters. Oh boy, what a hell of a ride it has been.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]There are a couple of complaints I could raise. Not spoiling anything away, maybe one of the characters could have been developed a bit differently. Also the pacing (while not crammed) might be confusing if you don't keep your eyes wide open. The fate of a couple of heroes also left me scratching my head a little. But I guess they are trying something different, instead of resorting to the same old story-telling formulas, so I think all that can be forgiven, although I do understand where people ranking this one 8/10 come from.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Worth re-watching, might be even necessary. At this point I think it's pointless to say if this movie is better than that one and what not. Most MCU movies hold their own unique place. And this one does. It delivers, and more.

We had more time to see more characters developments of Black Widow, Hawkeye, Hulk, Thor, Rocket, Nebula, Tony Stark, and Steve (Capt). I loved them all, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man stole the show, same goes with Chris Hemsworth, and Chris Evan portrayal of their characters. This is more of a Avengers movie than Thanos like we seen in Infinity War. Brie Larson did a wonderful job as Captain Marvel. She's not in this movie a lot surprisingly. This movie came a lot of surprises. The third act of the movie is freaking epic! One of the best scenes in history. OH MY GOD! I loved it so much, I can tell you it's totally fan service. You'll love it as well. Avengers: End Game is a satisfying ending and a great set up for the future of the Marvel universe! People are going to be talking about this movie a lot more than Infinity War. This game is going down to the history books. The movie lived up so much expectations.

In the Avengers, seeing the moment in which the Avengers first 'assemble', there is a very emotional response. This movie has a similar moment that evokes that same emotion of seeing the characters you have known and love from the comics come to life on the screen. Endgame truly felt like a large comic book crossover event that ties everything together satisfyingly.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]While this film definitely has 'plot holes' and flaws, to me it is a 10/10 film because I truly doubt that anyone would be able to recreate the magic that this film represents, 22 movies in over a decade, this saga represents more than a single cinematic motion picture can accomplish but elevates the artform of 'film' and forges its own category of epic sagas.",1075,pos,pos,neg,pos,

When I watched Avengers Endgame for the first time, it was the most surreal movie experience I had ever had. Everyone in the movie theater was screaming, crying, celebrating and clapping, I could easily compare it to reactions we get on World Cup Finales. Definitely a experience to remember, and it proves how much this movie touched our hearts! The characters get an epic ending, even though some of them didn't get the happiest one. It concluded a enormous saga and started a new one.

They managed to create a story for this movie, but at the same time also paying an omage to the original three trilogies giving, by this, a sense of closure for these characters. Every character had its own moment and place to shine throughout the movie. This is how the story ends and it's perfect, because this is how it's supposed to end: every character chose it's own destiny for once and it's incredibly sad and heartbreaking, but in the end it's the right thing. In conclusion, this is the greatest movie I've ever seen, thank you MARVEL.",1083,neg,neg,neg,neg,

Many of us comic fans and moviegoers care about the characters and their individual and collective plights. We have been part of this journey with them. This film delivers on so many levels. It is action-packed but isn't just an action film. It has a real human element with heart and soul. The various story lines of all the films over the last decade have converged to this finale and they gift wrap it, put a bow on it and then blow us away. I am truly fortunate to have been a part of it all. Two Thumbs (both of mine) waaaaaaaaaaaaaay up !!",1084,pos,neg,pos,pos,
"Definitely not as good as its predecessor but one to be conjured with nevertheless. The movie starts a bit slower than all MCU movies before it and it takes its precious time to get the action going, but once it does, its all forgiven and forgotten. Although predictable, because let's face it, where could they go after Infinity Wars? It delivers on all fronts! There were tears and laughter throughout the 3 hr long feature. The tears yanked out of you by Ant Man, Stark, Cap and Hawkeye and the laughter mainly by Thor who surprised everybody with his transformation, but also by Hulk/Banner who found a peaceful way to co-exist. There were cameos sprinkled throughout the whole length of the movie, some very emotional, like Agent Carter, who actually didn't have to say a single word to get the tears flowing. They tied up all the loose ends, revisited some great scenes from past beloved movies and, thankfully, did not give all the glory to insipid Captain Marvel, who despite being the most powerful of all the Avengers, delivers quite a forgettable performance. There are some key characters who will definitely not be coming back, but there is still plenty left for future plots. Although it will feel a lot less exciting with some of the most beloved characters absent from now on.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]All considered, a very good movie to end it all, one that you may want to watch it again to take it all in as I will be doing.

The first 45 mins is all filler and the last 15-20 mins after the big battle was excruciating all fan service and slow paced intending to pull at your emotions but I (and many others) felt nothing. I really felt like this movie never picked up and focused too much on romantic drama that it lost its humorous edge that the last movie had. The laughs in my sold out theater was sparse and underwhelming. It also became predictable with a lot of plot holes. The big death at the end felt forced. There was no reason for it.

As I left Infinity War a year ago I knew the Russo brothers will have to resolve the problem they have made for Marvel fans with its ending, but the first 2 acts of the Endgame took a shortcut that left me feeling cheated. The movie also fully retorts back to the old, light and humorous MCU movies tone, and due to its multitude of concluding goals its tempo was convoluted and rushed, leading it to let go of its new-found, bold and nuanced 'Inifinity War' approach. Aparantly the movie makers chose to pay tribute to their journey, while honouring expiring contracts rather than venture further into new terrains as they did in the last movie. The final scenes, although strong in implementation, are easily anticipated, while being a bit socially charged. The end scenes try to leave us with a sentimental sense that was ill-prepared for. I was also looking for a stronger tribute to Stan Lee. That being said, it was not boring.

I'm massively into the ""Avengers"" movies but not so much all the characters own films as there's so many, but the ones i have seen have all been excellent, Captain America & Hawkeye are my favourite characters of the Avengers team & I've loved all the Avengers films right upto ""End Game"" & then just WOW!!![?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]This is a very dark & apocalyptic fantasy Thriller, all the stakes are higher & the atmosphere is of sadness & loneliness, Clint aka Hawkeye really feels like the heart of this particular Avengers film as we see him as the ordinary & loving Family man who loses his family & becomes a dangerous vigilante, Hawkeye uses his skills to hunt & kill criminals & you feel his sadness,his anger & his despair & Jeremy Renner gives the best performance so far as the troubled Hawkeye, it's a dark path for a complex character & that's just the start of End Game. Captain America is the main big beating heart behind all this darkness & Chris Evans gives his most powerful performance so far as cap, Black Widow has some extremely dark & emotional moments & Tony Stark shows why he's such an important Avenger as well as the smartest!!! Heroes rise & Heroes fall.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]All the characters are fantastic here in End Game, each character is given more depth,drama & emotion so you really care for this team. The apocalyptic world is very eerie with half the people missing, it's creepy & lonely looking, the atmosphere is dark & gloomy & our heroes need to change this world. End Game still has hilarious moments scattered throughout it's huge running time as it does with the amount of emotional drama & action packed scenes, there's never a dull or boring moment i thought as i totally got into this dark new world created by the evil ""Thanos"" The Action is breathtakingly Awesome & the c.g.i fx are Outstanding to the highest quality with it's massive budget put to full use, this is an epic film in every way!!! The visual look is stunning!!! By the End i was an emotional wreck as the characters touched my heart & the action put on screen blew me away, this is the best Avengers movie it's also the ultimate Comic book movie & an instant CLASSIC.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Just watch it & laugh & cry at a MASTERPIECE of cinema. When it ended i felt a big sense of loss,sadness & Happiness & that's how this masterpiece grabs you by the heart!!!",1144,pos,neg,pos,pos,
"Avengers Endgame is one of the most excellent film that has ever been made this 21st century. With all of the 22 films culminated in one huge and complex story, the film satisfies the international community with an emotional and still an action-packed film that everyone will never forget, marking the end of an old era and giving way for more new characters and stories along the way for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe",1145,pos,pos,pos,pos,
"I had the chance to see this movie twice, midnight of the 23rd and again on the 24th as I live in Egypt and luckily the movie came out early and thank god to that. I will not spoil anything all I can say is the magic of this one marvel movie depended on the acting not on the visual effects. Throughout the movie I had all sorts of feelings from the first 10 seconds of the movie. I honestly don't care about those who keep saying that the ending of the movie was predicted and satisfying to the fans, all I know is this movie took me everywhere emotionally the two times! Thank you marvel studios and Disney for the perfect experience, it was way more than I expected and that is enough for me.",1146,pos,pos,pos,pos,
Great movie. I wonder where such great heroes live who rescue humanity? In real world I couldn't find help to rescue myself from torture for last 15 years,1147,pos,pos,pos,pos,
"I REALLY loved watching this epic conclusion to one of the most respected franchises of all time. With 'Endgame', this movie has exceeded all expectations for all Marvel fans out there. The Russos, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, and Kevin Feige had a lot of fun assembling this billion-dollar-worthy masterpiece. It can get emotional at times, but it is worth all the fun. 'Endgame' has achieved the top rank that outshines every other MCU movie ever existed. The heroes can think, act, and react because of their challenges they had to go through.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]For Marvel - keep up the good work.",1148,pos,pos,pos,pos,
"Yes it's a super hero movie, yes it's a blockbuster but damn, what a movie !!! Laughter, cheering and tears Avengers Endgame should not have resonated with me this way but having been invested in these characters over a decade it was the perfect way to finish. You will be missed old friends but thanks for the memories.",1149,pos,neg,pos,pos,
Amazing finale to the infinity saga if your a marvel fan this is a must see,1150,pos,pos,pos,pos,

You can see how the story goes in first 10 mins Takes forever to finish,1152,pos,pos,pos,pos,
Everything you expect but that 10 times. Throwbacks to previous movies. A movie for the real fans!!,1153,pos,pos,pos,pos,

There should be 2 movies so much story.. i want to see it again,1155,pos,pos,pos,pos,

"20 movies raised up my expectation from marvel, but the endgame was just a photo album of many actors and actresses who played in a movie with too much dialogues, minimum action scenes, childish plot, flat jokes and predictable events. I had two reservations for this weekend and canceled the other one as soon as I came of theater.",1157,pos,neg,pos,pos,

Everything a comic book fan can ask for and more. It is the most wonderful movie experience anyone can go to and the Russo's has done it all again. But somehow even better.,1160,pos,pos,pos,neg,XXXXXX
"Movie story line is well designed. Characters who acted had done their job good. I watched movie in Tamil version, actually it is not good. So my advice to see it in original version, so that we can connect to the movie closely. End credits given to the superheros are nice. This movie has action, love, sentiments, timing comedy, twist and turns are nice and it can easily understanding to all age group of audience. Thanks to Marvel and teams to get such a good story line, packed with all kind of feelings. 3 hrs you gonna enjoy. Initial 25 min need some patience to watch the movie.",1161,neg,neg,neg,neg,
Just wow! This is not what you'd excpect at all. The story was wrapped up amazingly. You'll definitely cry at the end and laugh in between. Just salute Marvel!,1162,neg,pos,neg,pos,XXXXXX
"Endgame was an eagerly anticipated event (it is an *event*) in my household: family members who saw it before others were assiduous in not revealing spoilers, such was the reverence for the film and not wanting to spoil it for others. Having seen it, I can now understand why.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I'm so old I remember reading the original Avengers comics, and one of the most satisfying things about Endgame was the fidelity, once again, to the spirit of the original comics and their characters, scripted by Lee and drawn by Kirby or Ditko. This is always a huge relief to a Marvel fan. Evans and Downey can be justifiably proud of the way they incarnated their characters, fleshing out in a very real and human way, the 2-dimensional comic. In fact it is a great effort by the whole cast: there is not one weak performance.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]It's one of the best-crafted films I've ever seen: this statement gives you a clue that it is not the crash-bang, thrill-a-minute extravaganza that we've come to expect from the genre. There are many poignant and tender scenes early on as the dreadful realization of Thanos's actions in Infinity War become apparent. The plot lines are clever, not contrived; with the trademark humour intact, as the action builds to one climax after another. I was looking out for the woke scenes and sure enough, they do come, but are immediately followed and tempered by a thrilling affirmation of the triumph and tragedy of the life of the Hero. What more can you ask for?[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]A truly momentous film. Great, even.",1163,pos,pos,pos,pos,
"The movie is great. They try to present itself as the ultimatum epic movie and i believe it succeeded. There is an epic moment on every corner.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The overall plot is a lot of mess, too much fan service and the action is good but could have been much better. A lot of mess in the battle scenes too.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]The movie is pure entertaining and fun. Don't bother too much about quality and technical stuff.",1164,neg,neg,neg,neg,
"Yes, I loved the movie. Did I like everything in the movie? No! Did I like the plotholes? No! Is the movie still enjoyable with its flaws? Definitely! First thing to note is that all leaks and teasers that were released before the movie actually came out were all pretty much lies. Or they were leaked to deliberately throw us all off. I like that I didn't know what was going to happen. I literally yelled in shock and surprise during many of the unexpected moments. I laughed at others. I definitely cried over many. Not everyone survives this movie, and yes, I cried over every loss, especially since I didn't see them coming.[?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]I don't want to put spoilers in this review, so it's hard to comment about the one thing I really didn't like how they chose to go with a certain female character. Let's just say they ended the movie with the uncertainty of this favorite gal, and I didn't believe for one second that it would have happened the way it played out. It kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. Probably why I rated 9 starts instead of 10. Of course, I'm sure it will all be rectified in the next sequel in the line for this rowdy group of characters, but that's a long ways away. At least my favorite male character will be in this sequel too, so I'm sure I will enjoy![?›è?å­—å?][?›è?å­—å?]Endgame is a must see for anyone who claims to love the MCU, especially if you watched Infitity War. You'll experience the full spectrum of emotions during this roller coaster of a ride. A definite must see.",1165,neg,neg,neg,neg,
"There aren't many words to describe how this film made me feel, but it definitely was the perfect ending for the Infinity Saga and it makes me incredibly excited for what is yet to come.",1166,pos,pos,pos,pos,
"This film is definitely worth the watch, it has a great balance between; action, emotion, and true reality. A perfect way to end a long time journey. There will be tearful moments but the directors have inserted Easter eggs and comedic elements throughout making the film a rollercoaster of emotion and drawing you in as an audience member. Absolutely Magnificent!!!",1167,pos,pos,neg,pos,
